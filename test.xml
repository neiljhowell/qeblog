<h3> </h3>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The cybersecurity battle is being lost on almost every front. In addition to the usual battery of threats aimed at organizations, automated, multi-phased attacks are becoming more common, and organizations are on their heels.</p>
<p>The good news is that hope is not lost. Many consider one of science fiction&#8217;s oldest tropes—artificial intelligence—to be their greatest hope for shifting the balance of power.</p>
<p>A recent study by Capgemini Research Institute, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.capgemini.com/research/reinventing-cybersecurity-with-artificial-intelligence/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Reinventing Cybersecurity with Artificial Intelligence: The New Frontier in Digital Security</a>,&#8221; said that before 2019, only about 20% of cybersecurity organizations used AI in their technology stacks. But the report concluded that &#8220;adoption is poised to skyrocket,&#8221; with 63% of organizations planning AI deployments by the end of 2020.</p>
<p>That shouldn&#8217;t be surprising. Companies are seeing an unprecedented explosion in the volume and sophistication of cyber attacks, and there are no signs of the situation abating any time soon.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/5-key-elements-next-gen-security-operations-center" rel="noopener noreferrer">Security operation centers</a> (SOCs) are overwhelmed by a fusillade of alerts. Threat actors are increasingly using automation to attack more quickly and effectively. At the same time, security teams are finding themselves with not enough personnel and with some staffers who are under-skilled.</p>
<p>The tedium of investigating and responding to this parade of known and unknown threats, along with the daunting odds of effectively containing them, is putting analysts at risk of burnout.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that SOCs are turning to AI for relief.</p>
<p>Empowering the SOC with AI-enabled tools is proving essential to turning the tide on cyber crime. It reduces the amount of time <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/ai-changing-secops-what-security-analysts-need-know" rel="noopener noreferrer">analysts have to spend on repetitive, time-consuming tasks</a>, so they can dive deeper into threat analysis and response. AI allows attacks to be identified and resolved more quickly, minimizing their impact and cost for the organization. And it positions analysts to work smarter rather than harder, providing a much-needed boost to productivity and morale.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s important to understand that AI is not one technology but many. The transformation of the SOC is being driven mainly by one AI subset: <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/state-machine-learning-soc-how-leverage-data-deluge" rel="noopener noreferrer">machine learning</a>. This form of AI automatically learns from data to make predictions, draw inferences, and discover patterns. This makes it uniquely suited to leverage the colossal amounts of security data that enterprises produce.</p>
<p>But <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/ai-cybersecurity-3-things-your-team-needs-know" rel="noopener noreferrer">bringing AI into the SOC</a> is not as straightforward as procuring a tool set and waiting for the magic to happen. It requires careful consideration of your organization&#8217;s business needs, your SOC&#8217;s skill set, and the outcomes you hope to achieve.</p>
<p>Failure to adequately prepare will likely have dire consequences. Gartner predicts that through 2022, some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2018-02-13-gartner-says-nearly-half-of-cios-are-planning-to-deploy-artificial-intelligence" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">85% of AI projects will fail</a> due to incorrect or mismanaged implementations.</p>
<p>In the following sections, you&#8217;ll learn how AI is transforming the SOC. First up: Why AI and advanced analytics-specific tools are critical given the changing tech landscape. Next, you&#8217;ll read about the key trends in AI and how AI is being applied to security and SOC teams. Lastly, you&#8217;ll learn about the criteria for considering AI-powered tools for your SOC.</p>
<h3><a target="_blank" name="matters" rel="noopener noreferrer"></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>AI in the SOC: What it is and why it matters</h3>
<p>When we consider everything the SOC is tasked with doing, the critical role AI can play within it becomes clearer. Broadly speaking, the SOC is responsible for centralizing security information for the entire organization, monitoring events in real time, and responding to security incidents. Any of these responsibilities can benefit from using AI.</p>
<p>But despite the hype surrounding AI in the enterprise, there is still a considerable amount of confusion about exactly what AI is and what its capabilities are. A bedrock understanding of AI is essential for determining how it can fit into your security operations and what results you can expect if you implement it.</p>
<p>AI can be best understood as an umbrella term that describes machines that are engineered to replicate a human&#8217;s natural intelligence. Humans can speak and hear, read and write, move through our physical environment, perceive input from the world around us, convert that input into knowledge, and problem-solve.</p>
<p>AI analogs exist for each of these human behaviors. Natural-language processing, for example, helps computers understand and interpret human languages. Computer vision helps them see and process visual information. Pattern recognition allows them to identify groups of similar objects.</p>
<h4>Machine learning is key</h4>
<p>Machine learning (ML) is perhaps the most popular and widely implemented field of AI. At its most basic, ML uses algorithms to autonomously process massive amounts of data, learn from it, make predictions or determinations based on what it has learned, and improve its performance over time.</p>
<p>When used for security purposes, ML is generally classified as one of two types—supervised and unsupervised—each uniquely suited to particular use cases.</p>
<p>In <strong>the supervised model</strong>, an algorithm is guided using a dataset that includes examples with specific outcomes for each one. The algorithm is told what variables to analyze and is given feedback on the accuracy of its predictions. In this way, the algorithm is &#8220;trained&#8221; using existing data to predict the outcome of new data.</p>
<p>Conversely, <strong>unsupervised ML</strong> explores data without reference to known outcomes. It&#8217;s best used to identify previously unknown patterns in unstructured data and group them according to their similarities.</p>
<h4>The tooling landscape</h4>
<p>Security tools have become increasingly sophisticated to keep up with the rising tide of advanced cyber attacks. <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/units/how-choose-siem-suite" rel="noopener noreferrer">Security information and event management (SIEM) tools</a> remain foundational for SOCs, providing a centralized way to identify, monitor, analyze, and record security incidents in real time. These tools aggregate, normalize, and apply analytics to security data from across the organization to discover security incidents and alert the SOC team to them.</p>
<p>However, SIEMs’ inability to detect manually instigated attacks and their reactive, alert-based approach makes them inadequate on their own. To shore up their defenses, SOCs often integrate their SIEMs with other, more specialized tools.</p>
<p>Security orchestration automation response (SOAR) is often a first step. Tools in this category can automate critical security processes such as investigating phishing messages, managing cloud security, and detecting compromised user accounts. Other tools address endpoint detection and response, network detection and response, vulnerability management, and threat intelligence.</p>
<p>These tools vary from centralized investigation platforms that are used by the whole team to specific tools that an analyst may use just within his or her investigation workflow. Tools may also include tasks such as threat intelligence that can be consumed as external services, said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/fsmontenegro" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Fernando Montenegro</a>, principal analyst for information security at 451 Research, now part of S&#038;P Global Market Intelligence.</p>
<p>Successfully integrated, these tools limit blind spots and improve coverage of the organization’s attack surface.</p>
<p>Of course, the best tools are useless if not applied correctly. Businesses must make sure they have the knowledge, resources, and strategy to combine these tools into a sophisticated SOC.</p>
<p>The modern SOC has three phases—visibility, management, and response—said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/codycornell" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cody Cornell</a>, co-founder and CEO of SOAR provider Swimlane. To have visibility, you need to have telemetry from the on-premises and cloud system, network, and users to see what is happening in the environment. &#8220;This is generally a combination of monitoring data that is aggregated into some log management system that has a strong search capability,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Once you have strong visibility into your systems, you need to be able to manage both the information from your monitoring system and external information such as intelligence and notifications from various sources—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.it-isac.org" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the Information Sharing and Analysis Center</a>, government sources, partners, and vendors.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is no consistent and iterative management system for information you are always going to be searching for the things you need, and it causes considerable context switching, which is inefficient,&#8221; Cornell said.</p>
<p>Finally, once you have visibility and you&#8217;re managing internal and external information well, &#8220;you need to be able to take action on it,&#8221; he said. Your response can take many paths—including remediation, recovery, mitigation, and investigation. The tools to help you take action can be the same tools that you use for visibility, &#8220;if you selected tools that have the right features and you make those features available via APIs to be better centrally instrumented,&#8221; Cornell said.</p>
<h4>Other ways AI can help the SOC</h4>
<p>SOC face multiple challenges. Some <a target="_blank" href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2567647/2019%20ESG%20eBook%20-%20Industry%20Trends%20in%20the%20Era%20of%20Cloud%20Computing%20-%20Chronicle%20-%20October%202019.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">63% of organizations</a> say that conducting cybersecurity analytics and operations in general is more difficult today than it was two years ago, according to a recent Enterprise Strategy Group survey. Organizations cite as contributing factors the rapidly evolving threat landscape, the increasing volume of cybersecurity telemetry data, and the increasing volume of alerts.</p>
<p>Most security operations try to address these problems manually, by throwing people at the tidal wave of alerts and hoping they are skilled enough to do a good job, said <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-triolo-546438/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Chris Triolo</a>, vice president of customer success at security vendor Respond Software.</p>
<p>But there are several factors that make this a less-than-ideal strategy. These include:</p>
<p><strong>Staff shortages</strong></p>
<p>The dearth of human capital in the SOC is a crisis. Each year, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.govtech.com/data/Boosting-the-Cyberworkforce.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">40,000 US cybersecurity jobs</a> go unfilled because the demand exceeds the pool of qualified talent, according to government data. That leaves too few people to keep up with the battery of alerts and attacks that the average SOC faces daily.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an attacker, all I need to do is find one way in, and I&#8217;m in,&#8221; said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/mariodaigle" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mario Daigle</a>, vice president of products at Interset, a provider of security-analytics solutions now owned by Micro Focus (<em>TechBeacon</em>&#8216;s corporate parent). &#8220;As a defender, I have to block every possible point of entry—which I would argue is impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a result, the deck is &#8220;completely stacked against the good guys,&#8221; Daigle said. Without the ability to use AI, you don&#8217;t have enough humans to find these threats and exploits. &#8220;It&#8217;s guaranteed someone is going to find a way in. When they do, your only hope is having machines help your humans be more efficient; otherwise you&#8217;re not going to find them.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Repetitive tasks</strong></p>
<p>People are good at cognitive tasks, but not at repetitive, high-volume activities—&#8221;and there are a lot of the latter in the SOC,&#8221; Respond Software&#8217;s Triolo said. Machines, on the other hand, excel at these activities.</p>
<p>Using AI and ML to analyze and triage security data provides more depth and consistency than even the best human analysis can match. Relieving SOC team members of this mundane activity, Triolo said, frees them to focus on hunting for real attacks and chasing down the attackers. It&#8217;s more engaging work that can go a long way toward preventing the burnout issues most SOC teams grapple with.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of technological expertise</strong></p>
<p>Like many other organizations nowadays, &#8220;there is a severe resource constraint at the same time that there is an almost <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Cambrian-explosion" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cambrian explosion</a> in the technologies that are being used&#8221; in the SOC, said 451 Research&#8217;s Montenegro.</p>
<p>Indeed, more than half of respondents in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3210486/cybersecurity-skills-shortage-profound-impact-on-security-analytics-and-operations.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">another ESG study</a> said their organizations don&#8217;t have the right skills or staff size to keep up with SecOps and analytics. AI-based security solutions can operate 24/7 and automate much of the work of lower-level analysts, allowing for fewer and lower-cost SOC personnel while significantly reducing the time to detect and remediate threats.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Top trends in AI, and what AI means for your SecOps team</h3>
<p>Currently, there are three main trends for AI usage in the SOC.</p>
<h4>1. Malware detection</h4>
<p>Malware detection is perhaps the most popular application of AI in the SOC. Historically, detection has focused on malware signatures, but this activity has become increasingly difficult as those signatures have grown more dynamic over time. Signature-based detection is also unsuited to first-of-a-kind malware such as advanced persistent threats. With no previous example to reference, a human would essentially have to notice some anomalous behavior to discover this type of malware.</p>
<p>In many SOCs, AI has stepped in. Armed with a decade&#8217;s worth of malware examples, teams can use supervised ML to train detection algorithms to recognize malware based on behaviors rather than signatures.</p>
<p>For example, some activity may look like malware because it has moved from this directory to that directory and then reached out to the network. Once deployed into the environment, SOCs find they can detect more malware than they could before, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephan-jou-7b952" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stephan Jou</a>, CTO of Interset.</p>
<p>Malware detection is the most mature and successful application of AI in the SOC, Jou said, largely because the security teams as a whole has had much experience with malware to learn from. AI does not replace signature-based malware detection, but complements it and makes detection much more effective overall.</p>
<h4>2. User and entity behavior analytics (UEBA)</h4>
<p>With their system-centric focus, SIEMs have a harder time detecting manually executed attacks than those implemented by malware. The anomalies that signal these insider threats—an employee logging into a server he&#8217;s never accessed before, for example—typically have to be spotted by a human analyst. That kind of serendipity is in short supply in resource-strapped SOCs.</p>
<p>AI is filling in the gaps here, too, employing UEBA. UEBA uses a technique known as anomaly detection, which is driven by unsupervised ML.</p>
<p>UEBA monitors the behavior for every user within the organization and learns what is &#8220;normal&#8221; so it can recognize activity that is &#8220;abnormal.&#8221; A typical example would be recognizing that John, who never logs in after work hours and always accesses machines A, B, and C, has suddenly logged in at 2 a.m. and accessed machines E and F. It can then process this information and determine whether the behavior is prelude to an attack.</p>
<p>The benefits of behavioral analytics are clear; with them the SOC can better detect hacked insider threats, privileged accounts, and brute-force attacks. However, UEBA adoption slowed early when tooling vendors overpromised on results. As companies have realized that UEBA, and AI in general, complement existing technologies rather than replaces them, it has been more widely embraced in the SOC.</p>
<p>&#8220;The use cases are starting to come out, and the customer stories are real now,&#8221; Interset&#8217;s Jou said. &#8220;I hear more and more companies saying they’re finding things they couldn&#8217;t have found before with traditional tools.&#8221;</p>
<h4>3. Threat hunting</h4>
<p>AI is also having an impact on threat hunting. That may at first seem counterintuitive when you consider how much this proactive technique relies on the human brain. Highly skilled security professionals hypothesize potential attacks in their heads, based on a vast knowledge of the threat landscape. Then, working under the assumption that attackers have already penetrated the system, they attempt to detect, isolate, and contain or eliminate sophisticated threats that slip past automated defenses.</p>
<p>But threat hunting relies on analyzing huge volumes of security data, and virtually all of it can be automated using a combination of traditional and cutting-edge technologies, according to Interset&#8217;s Jou. Threat hunting is probably the most immature of the AI applications in the SOC, he said, but it&#8217;s the skill that&#8217;s most in demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most SOCs don&#8217;t have threat hunters; they need to contract that out&#8221; or use a managed service, he said. &#8220;If you have one or two on your team, you&#8217;re very, very lucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are still tools that &#8220;we need to build to completely automate the things a threat hunter would do to make them more effective,&#8221; he said. But this AI application &#8220;is the one that has the most promise.&#8221;</p>
<h4>Future applications</h4>
<p>ML is what &#8220;a lot of people in security think about when they think of AI,&#8221; Jou said. &#8220;But AI is actually a lot more. There are things you can do in AI that go way beyond just learning things and finding patterns that are weird.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sees the SOC employing AI for optimization and recommendation. For example, many cellphone providers currently use AI-enabled customer service systems that look at the caller&#8217;s case history, including how many complaints they&#8217;ve made in the past and their severity. Then they recommend a course of action to the customer service rep that&#8217;s been optimized for customer retention.</p>
<p>He sees a similar approach being applied to threat hunting, where an AI-based system could look at the worldwide history of attacks, make a determination on a threat in that context, and recommend how best to contain that threat.</p>
<p>Jou also foresees natural-language processing playing a bigger role in threat hunting. &#8220;Remember,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the threat hunter has made a hypothesis in his head, then he&#8217;s having a dialogue with the data he has around him to try and figure out what might be happening in the organization. I would love for that dialogue to be a much more natural interface, almost like a conversation with the data as opposed to a building a query syntax.&#8221; </p>
<p>Technically, &#8220;we can already create that conversational interface; we just haven&#8217;t done it yet,&#8221; Jou said.</p>
<h4>AI&#8217;s eventual influence on the SOC</h4>
<p>Given how dramatically AI is redefining cybersecurity, it&#8217;s a given that it will impact the makeup of the SOC and how it conducts its daily business. The debate is over how deep and broad that effect will eventually be. </p>
<p>The industry agrees on one thing: AI is not meant to replace workers en masse. All the AI applications discussed here augment the efforts of the SOC team and help them to be more efficient. AI is also not meant to replace the SIEM or any other tool that&#8217;s already proving effective.</p>
<p>But while AI won&#8217;t replace jobs or commodity tools, it can, and probably should, replace tasks. In fact, when it&#8217;s implemented wisely, AI can help the SOC reclaim and reallocate resources. For example, monitoring, prioritizing, and triaging security alerts, the basic duties of a Tier 1 analyst, can be performed just as well by automation and orchestration technologies, which also scale more easily.</p>
<p>That allows organizations to move their Tier-1 analysts up into Tier-2 roles, such as incident analysis and response. Respond Software&#8217;s Triolo said this increases the security team&#8217;s capabilities without increasing its budget.</p>
<p>Similarly, tools such as anomaly detection don&#8217;t replace the need for human vetting but ideally allow security engineers to focus on fewer and more targeted incidents and to waste less time digging through logs and alerts, said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/platypii" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kenny Daniel</a>, founder of ML vendor Algorithmia.</p>
<h4>A need for more SOC data science</h4>
<p>AI tools will shift the balance of the SOC in another way, Daniel said. Teams will need <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/how-machine-learning-improves-your-security-predictions" rel="noopener noreferrer">stronger data science representation</a> to manage their new ML tools and to understand the data and signals available, as well as to help engineer defenses for their particular systems.</p>
<p>Generally, this will mean hiring people with higher levels of training or require additional training for existing team members. But &#8220;while that may come with a higher cost in the beginning,&#8221; using these tools to help streamline your response might mean you need fewer people to do the work, said <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-schonfeld/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ryan Schonfeld</a>, founder and CEO of RAS Watch, a security incident-management tool.</p>
<p>Another option for this is outsourcing your SOC functions—either some of them or all—to a company that already has these tools in place to reduce cost and increase value for the company.</p>
<p>Ultimately, AI doesn’t radically change the skill requirements for the SOC but instead maximizes the ones it already has on hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;If AI is effective, it also frees up analysts to do higher-order thinking, applying judgment, organizational knowledge, and relationships,&#8221; said <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaackohn/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Isaac Kohn</a>, a risk advisory principal at Deloitte. &#8220;So those skills are more important than ever.&#8221;</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How to select the right tool</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s tempting for SOCs to start their AI transformation by acquiring the trendiest tools. But you should employ a more strategic approach to ensure a successful result. Here are the essential factors for tool selection.</p>
<h4>Start with the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve</h4>
<p>It can&#8217;t be said enough that choosing the right AI solution should start with clarifying the issues your SOC struggles with most. Are you missing breaches? Do you have a malware problem? Did a rogue employee delete some important data? Are your analysts wasting time on repetitive tasks at the expense of more business-critical activities?</p>
<p>AI can help with all of these issues, but they require different types of tools, and throwing the wrong one at a problem will inevitably lead to wasted time and resources. So, for example, if you&#8217;re looking for a malware-detection tool, don&#8217;t confuse that with network threat analysis or risk mitigation. </p>
<p>Take the time to reflect on which security issues you&#8217;re most concerned about—and, specifically, what you&#8217;re being asked to report to leadership about—as a way to gain clarity around how AI can help you, Interset&#8217;s Jou recommended.</p>
<h4>Make sure you have the data</h4>
<p>Data is the fuel of AI. The larger the quantity and the better the quality of the data you put in, the faster and more accurate solutions AI will produce. As such, security leaders must ask the following questions about their data to maximize their AI efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Do you have the data? </strong>The goal is to have enough to represent every context that a system may encounter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is it &#8220;good&#8221; data? </strong>AI is only as good as the data you feed it. That means it should be accurate over a long period of time, with few inconsistencies, errors, or corruptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is the data labeled? </strong>Supervised ML requires data to be labeled in order to identify the properties or characteristics that can be used to train the algorithm. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is the data up to date? </strong>The threat landscape evolves at lightning speed, so current data is essential. A system trained using old data will struggle to detect the latest threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the source of the data? </strong>Make sure the data you intend to use is from a trusted source. Data from a suspect source may be inaccurate, corrupt, or even perverted by data sample poisoning, when a malicious user injects false training data to thwart the learning model.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&#8217;s common for organizations to find it has unclean or unlabeled data, those hurdles can be overcome with the help of third-party services. If, however you find your organization doesn&#8217;t have the required data or the skill to understand it, Interset&#8217;s Daigle said, you&#8217;re at an earlier stage of maturity and you may have to take a step back before you start buying tools.</p>
<h4>Decide whether to build or buy your AI</h4>
<p>Here again, 451 Research&#8217;s Montenegro said, you need a clear understanding of just what your business requirements are. Do you have specific needs related to your organization, such as compliance, complexity, risk tolerance, different threat models, specific resource constraints, or other considerations?</p>
<p>These answers are essential for your organization to determine whether you&#8217;re going to undertake AI tool development yourself or if you&#8217;re going to work with an AI-powered tool from an external provider—or something in between, he said.</p>
<p>Once you have your business criteria nailed down, weigh them against the relative pros and cons of building versus buying an AI solution. </p>
<p><strong>Building AI in-house</strong></p>
<p>A do-it-yourself approach allows you to build an AI solution tailored to your organization&#8217;s needs instead of paying for a package that likely includes features you&#8217;ll never use. It offers greater flexibility, allowing you to modify it on the fly and optimize it for future needs.</p>
<p>The downside is the time commitment and skills required. Deploying the system, training the data, reducing false positives, and the other considerable hurdles may require years of effort and come at a great cost. And that&#8217;s assuming you have the expertise in-house, which most organizations don&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>Buying packaged software</strong></p>
<p>Many of the advantages of buying an AI solution are the same that come with working with any third-party service. The vendor shoulders the infrastructure and maintenance expenses, as well as many of the security responsibilities, and sometimes ensures compatibility with other software.</p>
<p>This approach also provides the AI expertise most organizations lack and can leverage best practices from other clients to improve the implementation and performance of the product.</p>
<p>However, as is the case with any emerging technology, many vendors merely bolt AI onto their existing products, and almost all use their customers for research and development.</p>
<p>This can create a learning curve that can lead to lost time and money, especially in the short term. Feature bloat is also a potential problem for those organizations that need more customized solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Other factors to keep in mind</strong></p>
<p>Whichever route you decide is best for your company, it&#8217;s fundamental to have serious, realistic expectations about AI tools&#8217; capabilities and applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any tool that deals in absolutes or near absolutes warrants a lot of suspicion,&#8221; 451 Research&#8217;s Montenegro said. The tooling should match the expected usage.</p>
<p>If yours is a SOC team that prefers to experiment with building your own tools and models, for example, choosing a tool that only uses AI internally and delivers the results to you may not be what you&#8217;re looking for, he added.</p>
<p>The reverse is also true, he said: Choosing an AI development platform that &#8220;expects you to do the heavy lifting&#8221; in terms of creating the data pipelines, the models, etc., &#8220;when all you want is results, is not going to help you either.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>AI is transforming the SOC. As cyber attacks on organizations become more organized and efficient, augmenting your team&#8217;s analysts with AI-enabled tools gives you the best chance of gaining the upper hand.</p>
<p>Consider these steps to put your AI plan into action:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Start with the problem you want to solve, not with the “cool tool.” </strong>Understand that tools alone don’t solve business or security problems. Many organizations invest repeatedly in emerging tools—including AI—without fixing the operational or organizational issues that prevent them from achieving their desired outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Think realistically about how far you want to go with AI. </strong>Do you want to build your own tools and models, or do you just want to consume results? If the former, make sure you have the time and resources to commit to building and managing your own solution. If the latter, make sure you have the expertise, such as a data scientist or other tech staff, to vet vendors and evaluate their offerings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Determine whether you have enough data</strong> within your organization to properly train the models that you&#8217;re going to use or if you would you be better served by an external provider that has access to other customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make sure the basics are in place</strong>—namely an established control fabric and sensor grid. A good foundation for security operations is a log management strategy that allows you to store, search, and analyze data for investigations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>With the basics in place, you can focus on implementing security automation and workflow.</strong> This will increase the organization&#8217;s ability to isolate high-priority incidents, while maximizing the efficiency of the analyst team. Team leads should focus efforts on automating areas that are major time burdens on the staff or areas where humans don&#8217;t typically perform well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay focused on your objectives and be thoughtful about how to measure them. <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/software-security-measuring-stick-takes-it-all" rel="noopener noreferrer">Different organizations have different priorities</a>, whether it&#8217;s reducing the number of successfully executed attacks or reducing costs by being more effective with the security resources already in place.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This spring, Sauce Labs announced the Sauce Testrunner Toolkit (beta) to expand developer-first capabilities and support for native JavaScript frameworks.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>This spring, Sauce Labs announced the <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/platform/sauce-testrunner-toolkit" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sauce Testrunner Toolkit (beta)</a> to expand developer-first capabilities and support for native JavaScript frameworks. The Testrunner Toolkit makes setting up, writing, and running web tests easier and faster for developers during early pipeline testing. First it supported Puppeteer, followed by Cypress, TestCafe, and Playwright to provide the flexibility to test the way you want, along with Sauce Labs insights, at scale. </p>
<p>Now, you can speed up your native JavaScript tests by running tests in parallel within your CI/CD environment. This capability is available with any Sauce Labs account, and you can get started for free! This means you can make the most of your existing infrastructure without new investments, while still getting insights within Sauce Labs. </p>
<h3>How to Run Cypress Tests in Parallel with Sauce Labs</h3>
<p>In this example we’ll take a look at setting up and running Cypress tests in parallel using the Sauce Testrunner Toolkit with GitHub Actions. Then we will view the test results in the Sauce Labs UI.</p>
<p><i>Note: Find examples for using other test frameworks or CI/CD examples in the </i><a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.saucelabs.com/testrunner-toolkit/docs/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a><i>. </i></p>
<p>Prerequisites: You’ll need a <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/sign-up" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sauce Labs</a> and a GitHub account. You will also need existing cypress tests. In our example we have multiple tests located in the <code>./tests/e2e/cypress directory.</code></p>
<p>1. In your root project directory, create the following directory tree: <code>.github/workflows.</code> </p>
<p>2. And then add your Sauce Labs credentials to the GitHub Actions Secret Settings. </p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Add a <code>./sauce/config.yml</code>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/saucelabs/saucectl/blob/master/.sauce/puppeteer_parallel.yml" rel="noopener noreferrer">similar to this example</a>, and set <code>parallel</code> to <code>true</code>. </p>
<p><i>a. This will distribute and run the tests across as many jobs as you have defined in your CI</i></p>
<pre><code>parallel: true</code></pre>
<p>4. Create Github Action test.yml <code>.github/workflows/test.yml</code>. </p>
<p>In this example, we’re adding two parallel jobs: <code>cypress-parallel-1</code> and <code>cypress-parallel-2</code></p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/2sWXRum9WKdqiB7yZ0WvFA/72c064799c975f1fbd2733040dadcd4c/Screen_Shot_2020-10-14_at_1.17.44_PM.png?fm=webp" alt="Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 1.17.44 PM" title="Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 1.17.44 PM"/></p>
<p>5. Now, when you commit these files, GitHub will detect the new workflow actions and launch <code>saucectl</code> to run your tests. 	</p>
<p>The output may look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/3LJfkeLabtwaPOuzbet5zP/1a6d5379b08e757eda42ac77e533fcf3/github-action-parallel-results.png?fm=webp" alt="github-action-parallel-results" title="github-action-parallel-results"/></p>
<p>Congrats! The tests are now running in parallel with the help of the Sauce Testrunner Toolkit and you can view screenshots, videos and <a target="_blank" href="https://app.saucelabs.com/dashboard/tests/vdc" rel="noopener noreferrer">test results in Sauce Labs</a>.   </p>
<p>Sauce Labs is committed to supporting our users in delivering digital confidence, and providing what they need to test better, test faster, and test at scale. </p>
<h3>What’s Next</h3>
<p>Developers currently using Sauce Labs Testrunner Toolkit can run tests locally, or in their CI/CD pipelines, and then view the results in the Sauce Labs UI. In our next iterations, you will be able to configure tests from Testrunner Toolkit to execute in our virtual cloud environment. This will increase scalability and reliability to help developers truly embrace quality without sacrificing speed.</p>
<h3>Try It For Yourself! </h3>
<p>The Sauce Testrunner Toolkit beta is completely free! If you’d like to try it out for yourself, head over to our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/saucelabs/testrunner-toolkit" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github repo</a> where you can get started right away.</p>
<p>Happy Testing! </p>

As we have seen above, shadowRoot interface is the only entry point to the Shadow DOM tree when the mode is OPEN. In the case of CLOSED mode, we can not access any Shadow DOM tree elements. In simple terms we can say – we can not automate CLOSED mode Shadow DOM tree elements.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the CLOSED mode Shadow DOM tree is business-critical to automate, then we can ask our developers to keep the mode OPEN on the test environment sandbox, so that we can automate/run it. Developers still can keep CLOSED mode on the production environment.<br /></span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">                                                                                  OR </span></i></li>

<h2><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understood how QA Automation folks can interact with custom elements WITH / WITHOUT appending Shadow DOM.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">We got familiar with the role of the Open/Closed mode of Shadow Root, while finding the elements.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Got to know the limitations of regular selectors {Xpath, CSS} with Shadow DOM.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understood how to interact with multi-level Shadow Root elements.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clear thought on how TestProject’s OpenSDK supports Shadow DOM elements.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now we are pretty familiar with the Shadow DOM tree and its interaction with TestProject’s OpenSDK. But still, we have a few open questions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does TestProject <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/easy-test-automation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">record/playback</a> support Shadow DOM elements?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few more interesting aspects of the Shadow DOM tree?</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="entry-content">
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.neotys.com/neoload/whats-new" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NeoLoad 7.6</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> introduces new dashboard features, advanced updates to APIs and as-code capabilities, and enhanced search functionality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the highlights: We’ve made NeoLoad dashboards more powerful and flexible. Our APIs are now more extensible so you can integrate chaos testing campaigns, export raw data to a third-party system, manage your workspaces more systematically and stop a test from within a virtual user path. As-code validation capabilities have been enhanced, and we’ve introduced advanced settings for as-code scenarios. We added more search functionality so you can get to test results faster. And more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2>What’s New in This Release?</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Dashboard</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – New analysis and graph capabilities have been added to the dashboard. You are now able to analyze and share tables and text-editable comment fields, as well as export graphs in PNG format.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>APIs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – The NeoLoad REST and JavaScript APIs have several new capabilities.  You can now declare external events that will appear in Neoload Web test results values; extract raw data from Neoload Web; programmatically create, update and delete workspaces; and use the JavaScript API to stop a test if a virtual user experiences an issue during the test.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>As Code</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Test as code now includes additional advanced features like assertions and custom load policy, and new capabilities to guarantee that the test is running as expected.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Test Search</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Tests can be searched by name in the advanced search window on the dashboard. Access to test results is now even faster.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Feature enhancements</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are also included in this release.</span></li>
</ul>

					<description><![CDATA[These days, spending time with friends face-to-face still isn’t always an option for teens. So, finding a fun, new app]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>These days, spending time with friends face-to-face still isn’t always an option for teens. So, finding a fun, new app can be a little like discovering your own private beach where you can chill out, connect with friends, and be thoroughly entertained. Keeping them safe on that digital beach? That’s where parents can make a difference.</p>
<p>With all the popular, increasingly sophisticated video apps available, it’s easy to understand why safety ends up being the <em>last</em> thing on our kids’ minds. I get it. My daughter and I recently sat for hours watching Tik Tok videos and laughing until we cried.</p>
<p>However, October is National Cybersecurity Month and the perfect time to hit pause and talk about how to stay safe on all the apps vying for our attention.</p>
<p><strong>Popular Apps to Monitor</strong></p>
<p><strong>Triller.</strong> The Triller app is a video-based platform, much like Tik Tok, that has been around since 2015. Triller has a variety of filters, and music kids can use with the videos they create.</p>
<p><em>What to monitor: </em>Triller’s content may not always be appropriate, and because viewers can leave comments on videos, there’s a risk of cyberbullying. Also, Triller has some privacy loopholes such as data collection, location tracking, and a public account default — all of which can be modified in Settings.</p>
<p><strong>HouseParty</strong> is a group video chat platform nicknamed the “Quarantine App” since its popularity increased by an additional 10 million users during the COVID lockdown. Houseparty allows users to invite friends and “friends of friends” into group video-chat sessions — much like a party. The app displays up to eight live streams on the screen at a time, creating an instant sense of community.</p>
<p><em>What to monitor.</em> Because the app allows “friends of friends” to livestream in a group, that unknown element opens the door to a number of safety issues. Encourage kids to deny join requests from unknown people. While some users leave rooms unlocked while live streaming their party, encourage your child to use the padlock function to limit conversations to people who know each other.</p>
<p><strong>Yubo.</strong> The Yubo app (formerly Yellow) is also called the “Tinder for Teens.” Kids can connect and live stream with people they know — and easily connect with people they don’t. If two users swipe right, Yubo will match them, and they can share Snapchat or Instagram names. Another app very similar to Yubo is the Hoop app.</p>
<p><em>What to monitor.</em> Content on Yubo can be explicit and cyberbullying can arise more often since fake accounts are common. Yubo’s swipe format promotes a appearance driven match standard may not be healthy for some teens.</p>
<p><strong>Byte.</strong> Another app similar to Tik Tok, Byte, features short-form videos. Byte, created by the Founders of the now defunct Vine app, lacks the filters and music of other video apps, but that’s okay; the simplicity is a plus for Byte fans.</p>
<p><em>What to monitor:</em> Be aware of inappropriate content, cyberbullying in comments, and unknown “friends” who may be part of your child’s Byte community. Online predators have been known to reach out to kids on this app. While unwanted followers can be blocked, surprisingly, Byte doesn’t give you the ability to make your account private.</p>
<p><strong>App Safety Basics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practice personal responsibility.</strong> The theme for Cybersecurity Month 2020 is <em>Do Your Part #BeCyberSmart</em>. With this in mind, discuss the responsibility that comes with owning technology, be it a smartphone, a game system, a smartwatch, or any other connected device. The goal, says <a target="_blank" href="https://staysafeonline.org/cybersecurity-awareness-month/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The National Cyber Security Alliance</a>,</p>
<p>“If you connect it, protect it.”</p>
<p><strong>Privacy settings.</strong> To protect privacy and keep unknown people from connecting with minors, maximize privacy Settings on each new app.</p>
<p><strong>Increase safeguards.</strong> Apps can be addictive and siphon family time, study time, and sleep. A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/parental-controls/mcafee-safe-family.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">comprehensive security solution</a> can help parents limit device time, monitor activity, and block risky content and apps.</p>
<p><strong>Share wisely.</strong> Even a 15-second video shared with “close friends only” can end up in the public stream. Advise your child to only share videos or photos they’d feel good sharing with the world.</p>
<p><strong>Protect personal information.</strong> Remind your child not to share private details about themselves or their family members with anyone online. This includes emails, full names, phone numbers, pet names, school names, or location.</p>
<p><strong>Block and report.</strong> Talk with your child about what you consider appropriate versus inappropriate content, how to block strangers, and how to report cyberbullying and scams.</p>
<p>Finally, keep talking with your kids — about everything. Ultimately, it will be your consistency in having honest, ongoing dialogue with your child that will be your most valuable tool in keeping them safe online.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The most recent Accelerate: State of DevOps Report describes what elite-performing DevOps engineers look like. The key differentiator for those DevOps-focused software]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/2019-accelerate-state-devops-report-how-elites-drive-high-performance" rel="noopener noreferrer">most recent Accelerate: State of DevOps Report</a> describes what elite-performing DevOps engineers look like. The key differentiator for those DevOps-focused software engineers is velocity. They iterate fast from commit to deployment, they deploy frequently, and they recover quickly.</p>
<p>Velocity via automation is fundamental to DevOps and CI/CD culture. Building the right pipes and process helps <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-descartes-labs-achieved-safe-mission-critical-continuous-delivery" rel="noopener noreferrer">create an elastic, scalable, and secured</a> infrastructure and applications.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how you can use cloud and DevOps principles to leverage and automate security.</p>
<h3>On-demand and self-service</h3>
<p>As a DevOps engineer you can help your clients provision any resource they want, without human interaction. How? Through preparation and templates.</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s a lot of work. And yes, you can integrate security into those templates. That way, developers don&#8217;t have to worry about misconfiguring the infrastructure. (For the most part, even when they worry, they still misconfigure it. They might as well use your template.)</p>
<h3>Provide secured, and broad, network access</h3>
<p>Working from home has become much more prevalent in the last six months or so, and it looks as if it&#8217;s here to stay. You need to allow your organization to provide secured access to any resource your developers need, from anywhere they want. This includes laptops, mobile devices, workstations, etc.</p>
<p>Since many of us share our at-home bandwidth with family members (and unintentionally our neighbors, too), you should <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/zero-trust-security-how-get-started" rel="noopener noreferrer">incorporate a zero-trust mechanism</a> in your networks and access points.</p>
<h3>Allow for rapid elasticity and resource pooling</h3>
<p>Provision and assign resources dynamically and at scale, as much as needed. A growing startup, for example, should design its infrastructure while thinking about the future. Someday it might have to support a hundred times, or even a thousand times, more users than it currently does.</p>
<p>Your design right now should support this growth automatically. There are many use cases where scaling down will also be necessary, so think about triggers for that as well.</p>
<h3>Measure your services</h3>
<p>One of the great powers of the cloud is that <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-cloud-based-apps-are-so-hard-manage" rel="noopener noreferrer">everything can be monitored</a>. The logs and metadata are there; you just have to activate them and stream them to your favorite log analysis software. It&#8217;s going to help you both for ops and security purposes.</p>
<p>You can control, detect, respond, and optimize. If you haven&#8217;t done it by now, enable your flow logs and choose &#8220;all&#8221; actions. (The default is to log accepted traffic, even though what&#8217;s rejected has much to tell you.)</p>
<h3>CI/CD is also all about automation</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/seven-key-enablers-continuous-testing" rel="noopener noreferrer">Add automated testing</a> to your CI process, so that any broken code will be detected quickly and the relevant developer will be notified and get a chance to push corrections fast as well. Code should be clean of operation bugs, but also of security bugs and issues, and there&#8217;s no reason not to test them together. This will give developers a lot of confidence in their code and in your pipe.</p>
<p>The CD process should allow teams a lot of independence; you should minimize the dependence on other teams for support or resource approval. As stated before, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-keybank-achieved-continuous-integration-delivery" rel="noopener noreferrer">build the pipeline</a> to be as self-service as possible; this will save you and your team time from repeating the same tasks, and specifically the security-related tasks that no one likes to do.</p>
<h3>Put these principles into action</h3>
<p>How exactly are you going to implement all of these principles and be awesome DevOps or DevSecOps engineers? With the right tools. You know a tool is right when it integrates well with your current pipe and processes.</p>
<p>Even if setup takes a little time, it&#8217;s going to save you a lot of time down the line. Elite performers automate any process they can and free up their time to do the things they have passion for.</p>
<p>Here are a few open-source tools that I find useful and that help me automate security along the CI/CD pipeline.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-commit:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thoughtworks/talisman" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Talisman</a> helps make sure your developers are not committing credentials and tokens.</li>
<li><strong>Secrets management:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS secrets manager</a> addresses the common bad practice of storing credentials in configuration files. Using a secrets manager can mitigate the risk of losing credentials.</li>
<li><strong>Software dependencies check:</strong> Everyone uses open-source and third-party code and packages, which often contain vulnerabilities. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">OWASP Dependency Check</a> helps check that problem on a regular basis.</li>
<li><strong>DAST:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">OWASP ZAP</a> scans your web applications.</li>
<li><strong>SAST:</strong> Check out <a target="_blank" href="https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">OWASP</a>&#8216;s analysis on different tools for this, based on the relevant coding languages they support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you&#8217;ve got what it takes to be an elite DevSecOps performer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Before optimizations Too many Selenium commands in a test can lead to tests that are dramatically slower and less reliable.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<h2>Before optimizations</h2>
<p>Too many Selenium commands in a test can lead to tests that are dramatically slower and less reliable. Every Selenium command carries the potential for an invalid element locator or a synchronization issue. </p>
<p>Below we have a table that shows an automated test that was designed to click two radio buttons. V1 test is making 157 Selenium commands and takes 95 seconds to execute. After optimizations, the same exact test executes 9 Selenium commands and runs in 17 seconds (5X faster).</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/4qf88G5OmFvicYOD8342m0/67f9c3e26399b89c679678ea4090531f/Nikolay_Selenium_2.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 2" title="Nikolay Selenium 2"/></p>
<p>Total test run time V1</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/2PdwvxH2wjJbPCjMAFSU7W/8ef2197447101b4addcbc3dc46411a61/Nikolay_Selenium_3.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 3" title="Nikolay Selenium 3"/></p>
<p>Number of web requests before optimizations (V1)</p>
<h3>What was the purpose of this test?</h3>
<p>The purpose of this test was to simply click two radio buttons on this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.techlistic.com/p/selenium-practice-form.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">URL</a>. </p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/7Bh8BzL1b9d42fxMrbWRYY/df78d7258b02482a163040078508fbc9/Nikolay_Selenium_4.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 4" title="Nikolay Selenium 4"/></p>
<h2>Identifying the inefficiencies</h2>
<p>The major contributor to the slow test time of such a simple test was the large number of unnecessary web requests.</p>
<h3>Attempting to click first radio button</h3>
<p>After loading the URL, the test takes ~60 seconds searching for random elements without taking a single action.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/2sAAdrMFkSsG0rkxBucoGH/255c39548667b5ea8cd2a6b64a60c950/Nikolay_Selenium_5.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 5" title="Nikolay Selenium 5"/></p>
<p>Unnecessary commands start at the 15-second mark and continue until 1:19, at which point the element is finally located and clicked.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/60QX6hnkDKYK8OVIcfTuCa/455edc504b820a07c1ecd498d5fb71cc/Nikolay_selenium_6.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay selenium 6" title="Nikolay selenium 6"/></p>
<p><b>Potential Waste</b>: 60 seconds on 1 element</p>
<h3>Attempting to click second radio button</h3>
<p>At 1:23, the test starts looking for the Female radio button.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/29crys9WCabuTnlavyEyRV/e70cb38772ab429cfdc3a926a5e649c5/Nikolay_Selenium_7.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 7" title="Nikolay Selenium 7"/></p>
<p>And finally clicks it at 1:28:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/7hcpyvYRp5SkzAwEWD926F/74d35dbb1a4d6773035a5310e76dbcfc/Nikolay_Selenium_8.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 8" title="Nikolay Selenium 8"/></p>
<p>&#8230;but not before making 16 more Selenium commands to check whether the element is displayed or selected.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/1CfqaMx9uCWgjZzInBE1BZ/001d99f1d52c948bf4efc138c0a47339/Nikolay_Selenium_9.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 9" title="Nikolay Selenium 9"/></p>
<p><b>Potential waste</b>: 3 seconds for every element.click()</p>
<h3>Post-click() Selenium commands</h3>
<p>Finally, there is an interesting pattern of wasted web requests that happens after every element click(). We can see that below:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/zFlYW74bOxtCWb3hcrenK/3986d1d533461a4cf8406681c58d1288/Nikolay_Selenium_10.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 10" title="Nikolay Selenium 10"/></p>
<p>It’s understandable that these are being performed to validate that the element is in the correct state after the execution of a click(). However, these actions are wasteful because Selenium would throw an error if the action wasn’t successful. Furthermore, the next action would fail with an exception if it depended on the state of the previous element.</p>
<p><b>Potential waste</b>: 2 seconds per element.click()</p>
<h2>The refactor using cleaner practices</h2>
<p>The refactoring of this test was extremely simple and required only a few minutes after understanding the root cause of the problem. Furthermore, we saw that the final outcome of the refactoring created a test that was 560% faster and drastically more stable because it had fewer Selenium commands.</p>
<p>Here’s the code after we finished refactoring:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/1qGim9lteXAjj7FvuX3MxF/b0f50e2458f4a1d2197a4bd6a44bcc6c/Nikolay_Selenium_11.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 11" title="Nikolay Selenium 11"/></p>
<p>This is the <a target="_blank" href="https://app.saucelabs.com/tests/d853239cec5041f3a6f6ec85342e3be5" rel="noopener noreferrer">test execution result</a> and below is the screenshot.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/3Ruv9nbEkTFYxvfaJmXVtn/2f96e47612918802ae021907d5362f8b/Nikolay_Selenium_12.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 12" title="Nikolay Selenium 12"/></p>
<h2>Lessons learned</h2>
<p>Bloated tests in the industry are infamously common and it’s something that I tackle on a weekly basis. They typically come with a framework that we use for our automation. I’ve seen this with both OSS frameworks and especially homegrown ones. The key is to consider the impact of extra Selenium commands on the overall automation program. In this use case, the test suite execution time will be five times longer for the entire organization. This obviously decreases the feedback cycle time and also <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/blog/using-the-continuous-testing-benchmark-to-build-digital-confidence" rel="noopener noreferrer">makes the automation less reliable</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Quite recently, I gave a talk at Selenium Conference 2020 Virtual on How to build an automation framework with Selenium:]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>Quite recently, I gave a talk at <a target="_blank" href="https://2020.seleniumconf.in/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium Conference 2020</a> Virtual on <a target="_blank" href="https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2020/proposal/13303/how-to-build-an-automation-framework-with-selenium-patterns-and-practices" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>How to build an automation framework with Selenium: Patterns and practices</b></a>. In this session, I talked about what are some of the basic building blocks of a good test automation framework implementation and some good <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/06/29/design-patterns-in-test-automation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">design patterns</a> to follow and anti-patterns to avoid.</p>
<p>If interested, You can see all the slides for this on <a target="_blank" href="http://automationhacks.io/slides/docs/ui_automation_framework/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">my blog site</a> and the video once ConfEngine releases it on their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ConfEngine/videos" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>After this talk, it led me to think more deeply in terms of what are the mistakes that we as testers/automation engineers make in our test automation, and could we rather avoid these in the first place and, well, not <b>do it</b> in the first place <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />?</p>
<p>I’ve been personally burnt due to some of these mistakes in my career and so I wanted to take some time out and write this post, in order to shed some more light on these mistakes and how you can avoid making them in your test automation code.</p>
<p>We will discuss these in the UI automation context but some of these are general test automation anti-patterns to avoid.</p>
<p>Let’s get started, shall we?</p>
<h2><strong>Writing Assertions Inside The Page Objects</strong></h2>
<p>When we write <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">UI automation</a> using the page object pattern, initially it could be quite tempting to even put assertions inside the page object classes, I’ve personally been guilty of this. However, doing so leads to unnecessary complexity in the page objects wherein you might end up writing multiple methods to satisfy both positive and negative scenarios on a given page.</p>
<p>However, if your assertions are kept outside the page objects and mostly in your Test files or Test helpers, then you can treat the page object as just an abstraction for a given <b>Page or Component</b> and reuse the same method to verify different outcomes.</p>
<p>Writing assertions in tests is a very natural readable thing to do as your colleagues don’t have to dig into a long page object to figure out what the test is trying to assert. Angie Jones also alludes to this in her very insightful post on <a target="_blank" href="https://angiejones.tech/page-object-model/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tips for healthy page objects</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, you can adopt the same philosophy even when writing Functional API automation. Keeping assertions in test files instead of deeply nested layers of abstraction ensures you follow the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" rel="noopener noreferrer">KISS (Keep it simple, stupid)</a> principle while resulting in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20separation%20of,code%20of%20a%20computer%20program." rel="noopener noreferrer">good separation of concerns</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Writing WebDriver API Methods in Tests/Page Objects</strong></h2>
<p>While creating a UI automation framework, it is quite easy to fall in the trap of writing <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/06/30/selenium-4-new-window-tab-screenshots/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium WebDriver</a>/<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/category/appium/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Appium</a> Driver methods (driver.sendKeys(), driver.click()) directly in your page objects, or even in tests.</p>
<p>The main problem with such an approach is that you are mixing different responsibilities into page objects and test classes. Your test classes should be all about performing a single atomic action and verifying its outcome using meaningful well-written assertions.</p>
<p>Having WebDriver methods in tests is a really bad idea since if there are any changes in Selenium WebDrivers API or different versions of the library, then you would have to make these changes in all your test files/page objects.</p>
<p>It’s always a good idea to wrap third-party libraries into your own abstractions since this prevents these dependencies leaking throughout your framework and is a way to write clean code (You can read more about clean code <a target="_blank" href="https://automationhacks.io/2018/11/25/basics-of-writing-clean-code/" rel="noopener noreferrer">in my article</a> or in this great <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/04/22/clean-code-in-tests-what-why-and-how/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clean Code</a> article by Corina Pip).</p>
<p>Instead, It is much better to write wrapper functions over WebDriver methods in a <b>BasePage</b> class and either inherit or compose this in all your page objects. This way, if anything changes, you have to make these changes in a single place instead of fixing these in multiple places. This very nicely adheres to the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="noopener noreferrer">DRY (Don’t repeat yourself)  principle</a> which is considered a very good programming practice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have WebDriver APIs in your test methods, You’re Doing It Wrong.</p>
<p>– Simon Stewart</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Writing Long E2E Tests with Multiple Actions and Assertions</strong></h2>
<p>When writing <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">test automation</a>, it is often quite convenient to model entire user journeys as long winding E2E tests with multiple intermediate assertions. You can even argue that it leads to writing less code. However, these tests in the long run turn out to be a nightmare because of multiple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They execute very slowly since most of these are from the Web/Mobile level which inherently has multiple factors leading to slow speed.</li>
<li>If one earlier assertion fails, none of the succeeding assertions are executed, leading to a lack of coverage.</li>
<li>These tests are quite flaky and non-deterministic, when they fail it’s often due to multiple different reasons, leading to great difficulty in debugging and maintaining these.</li>
</ul>
<p>Above are some of the reasons why this is a bad idea. So what can we do?</p>
<p>Instead, prefer to write shorter, more targeted <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/03/12/creating-ui-automation-that-is-focused-reliable-and-fast/" rel="noopener noreferrer">atomic tests</a> that verify a single aspect of your system under test functionality.</p>
<p>It’s quite useful to refer to the <a target="_blank" href="https://automationintesting.com/2019/08/trims-automation-in-testing-strategy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">TRIMS</a> heuristic coined by Richard Bradshaw of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MOT (Ministry of testing</a>/<a target="_blank" href="https://automationintesting.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automation In testing</a> fame).</p>
<p>The most obvious benefit that you get by writing atomic tests is that they are very easy to parallelize and deterministic in nature. When they fail, it usually is for a single reason and hence it’s quite easy to debug and maintain them.</p>
<h2><strong>Treating UI Automation as The One and Only Hammer for Every Nail</strong></h2>
<p>UI automation that works is quite wonderful to watch. Quite often one common mistake made by new budding automation engineers (after learning the WebDriver API) is obviously to try and use it for every use case that they can think of.</p>
<p>What could very well have been a medium-sized test suite to verify essential functionality (that could only be verified on the UI), turns into a gigantic suite of UI automation that tests every possible functionality from the UI <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f92f.png" alt="🤯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Such a huge suite is a debugging and maintenance nightmare and very quickly turns into a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns" rel="noopener noreferrer">point of diminishing return</a> wherein you spend more time maintaining these flaky tests than spend time improving the quality of the product by the numerous other activities that you could have done.</p>
<p>I know, it’s not easy to let go of the temptation. But trust me, this is a hard choice that should be made sooner than later.</p>
<p>So what could we do?</p>
<p>Be more intentional and mindful of your automation. Treat UI automation as a part of your automation stack, but <b>not the only part</b>. You could instead test more functionality via the API or push some of these tests into Component Level tests instead of E2E tests.</p>
<h2><strong>Test Automation can Replace Exploratory Testing</strong></h2>
<p>One common mistake that a lot of organizations make is to think that <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/03/26/automation-testing-for-beginners-ultimate-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer">automated testing</a> is the only flavor of testing that’s needed to handle the scale of the organizations.</p>
<p>You would hear crazy claims/call to actions to automate 100% of the manual test cases as if that’s going to magically get translated into a high-quality product (valuable to the customer).</p>
<p>Test automation, while being a very powerful tool in the tool belt of a skilled tester, is not the only weapon and is quite inefficient in creatively exploring the product and thinking of its different flaws all the while exploring it. It is often inflexible in that it cannot change on the fly to different demands that your product might have, however, exploratory testing can.</p>
<p>Thus, instead of one being the replacement of others, think of them as two amigos and two sides of the same coin: with test automation as a way to get rid of the boring repeatable steps and to take care of giving the fast feedback that the team needs, whereas exploratory testing as a way to find the different areas of the system that are not yet explored and can feed into future automation projects or find really hard to detect bugs.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Are these the only mistakes that an automation engineer can make? Heck no, I’m sure you would have made some yourself. Why not share your experience around it with the community so that we can all learn from them and maybe not make them in the first place</p>
<p>If you found this post useful, do share it with a friend or colleague. Until next time, Happy Testing/Coding <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/262e.png" alt="☮" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<div>
<p>Manoj Kumar published a <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/selenium-4/" rel="noopener noreferrer">teaser on Selenium 4</a>, listing the new features expected and important deprecations across the Selenium Suite( Selenium IDE, Selenium WebDriver, and Grid). </p>
<p>This has already caused a buzz in the industry for not only testers but for the Ops and Dev communities as well. And why wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>Features such as the integration of DevTools APIs with Selenium Webdriver and Observability add a lot of value and expand Selenium’s reach.</p>
<p>Many requests were made by the community, asking for details on each of the features. Hence we started this series of posts addressing the features of Selenium 4.</p>
<p>In the first <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/selenium-4-migration/" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> of the Selenium 4 series, we discussed the deprecated components and their replacements.</p>
<p>In this blog post, as well as the next one, we will focus on some of the new features offered in Selenium 4, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relative Locators</li>
<li>Window and Tab Management</li>
<li>Chrome DevTools Protocol (next post)</li>
<li>Observability (next post)</li>
<li>Enhanced Exceptions (next post)</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/how-to-install-selenium-4/" rel="noopener noreferrer">install Selenium 4</a> to be able to try the features we’ll discuss.</p>

<h2 class="heading-secondary">Webinar: Test Driving Selenium 4 with Angie Jones</h2>

</div>
<h2 id="h.eqka15d8494y">Relative Locators in Selenium 4</h2>
<p>All the engineers working on building web-based test automation scripts spend quite a bit of time writing and maintaining locators across the builds. It can be challenging to locate a few of them, especially the grids. </p>
<p>Tools such as Sahi and Taiko already have features to locate nearby elements by specifying the directions, however to accomplish this in Selenium requires complicated Xpath or CSS selectors to navigate to a “direction” around the hierarchical tree nodes in the DOM. This limitation often leads to inefficient locators, which make the tests brittle.</p>
<p>Relative Locators have come to the rescue by helping us locate elements based on their position with respect to other elements.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://angiejones.tech/selenium-4-relative-locators/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relative locators</a> provide a newly added locator strategy to the existing eight (id, name, XPath, cssSelector, linkText, partialLinkText, className, and tagName) locator strategies. Relative locators locate the elements with respect to nearby specified elements.</p>
<p>A new method withTagName() is added, which returns an instance of RelativeLocator.RelativeBy class, a child class of By and offers methods to specify the direction of an element to be located.</p>
<pre id="h.hd241mdm7m8c" class="wp-block-preformatted">above()</pre>
<p>Used to locate an element just above the specified element</p>
<pre id="h.tzw7s8ffabyr" class="wp-block-preformatted">below()</pre>
<p>Used to locate the an element just below the specified element</p>
<pre id="h.tm1xnun7njcd" class="wp-block-preformatted">toLeftOf()</pre>
<p>Used to locate the an element located on the left of a specified element</p>
<pre id="h.ub47tke6i305" class="wp-block-preformatted">toRightOf()</pre>
<p>Used to locate the an element located on the right of a specified element</p>
<pre id="h.ytfqi6p52lfq" class="wp-block-preformatted">near()</pre>
<p>By default, it is used to locate an element at 50 pixels distant from a specified element. The distance can be passed as an argument to an overloaded method.</p>
<p>Let’s learn to use them with an example. We will use <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/category/advanced-topics/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advanced Blogs on Applitools</a> webpage for this exercise.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>
<p>On the Landing page we could see 12 blogs with titles and links to the blogs listed in four rows and three columns each. Inspecting the page, we see each of the elements are listed using the ‘article’ tag and an id attribute.</p>
<p>For instance, I need to locate the Blog ”How to Visually Test React Components Using Our Storybook SDK,” which is visually located just below the first blog, “Migrating to Selenium 4: Here’s What Has Changed”.</p>
<p>Inspecting the DOM, I learned that all blogs have the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.javatpoint.com/html-tags" rel="noopener noreferrer">html tag</a> “article” and the blog “Migrating to Selenium 4: Here’s What Has Changed” has an attribute id as “post-22539”.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="394" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0.png" alt="pasted image 0" class="wp-image-23761" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0.png 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-300x74.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-1024x252.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-768x189.png 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-1536x378.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
<p>I could now locate “How to Visually Test React Components Using Our Storybook SDK” specifying its html tag “article” using withTagName(“article”) method and locating the “How to Visually Test React Components Using Our Storybook SDK” element with below() method as demonstrated on line 18.</p>
<p>First the “Migrating to Selenium 4: Here’s What Has Changed” blog is located using the id attribute and then below() method is used as direction to locate the “How to Visually Test React Components Using Our Storybook SDK” blog element.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/ShamaUgale/b5e81d28bb9e32f9b2ecec4b5b8c647b.js</p>
</div>
<p>Similarly, refer to the sample code for the usage for above(), toRightOf() and toLeftOf() methods.</p>
<p>For more information on Relative Locators, <a target="_blank" href="https://angiejones.tech/selenium-4-relative-locators/" rel="noopener noreferrer">see this article by Angie Jones</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h.rvklczo2ffy2">Multiple Windows and Tabs</h2>
<p>Need to work with multiple windows or applications in a single test flow?  This is now possible!</p>
<p>We can create and open a brand new or tabbed window in the same session without having to create a new driver object to manage multiple applications in the same test.</p>
<p>This can be done with the newWindow() method.</p>
<p>On line 23 of the following code snippet, we create a brand new window by passing WindowType.WINDOW to newWindow() method. This will create a new window with the same driver reference.</p>
<p>On line 25 we open <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> in this window by using navigate().to() method or get() method.</p>
<p>Similarly, we could create a new tabbed window by passing WindowType.TAB as a parameter to newWindow() as shown on line 39.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/ShamaUgale/827a77b279322dcdd6c6395605aabcb0.js</p>
</div>
<p>To switch between these windows, you need to fetch the window IDs just like in the above example from line no 27-36, as we have been doing it in the previous versions of Selenium WebDriver.</p>
<h2 id="h.pl203j8ozjgb">W3C Standardization</h2>
<p>Selenium is a <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/2020-front-end-automation-testing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">widely used tool</a> for end users as well as vendors. Other popular automation tools such as Appium and Protractor are built on top of Selenium APIs.</p>
<p>With this, the tools that integrate with Selenium 4 now need to follow the W3C standard protocol.</p>
<p>In previous versions of Selenium Webdriver, JSON wire protocol was used to communicate between the Selenium Webdriver APIs and the browser native APIs. Every request and response communicated across the protocol was encoded and decoded. With W3C compliance, the communication between WebDriver and the browsers happens directly without any encoding and decoding required.</p>
<p>This means any software following W3C standard protocol can be integrated with Selenium with no compatibility issues. All the major browsers such as Chrome, IE and Safari are already W3C standard compliant.</p>
<h2 id="h.3bst29ontuje">Summary</h2>
<p>We went through a few of the new methods and features implemented in Selenium 4 and have provided ready-to-use code snippets for working with new and tabbed windows, installing and uninstalling the addons for Firefox and taking element level screenshots.</p>
<p>We learned how to use a brand new locator strategy, the Relative Locators, introduced in Selenium 4. We also discussed the importance of W3C standardization for tool vendors and products built on top of Selenium.</p>
<p>In the next post of this series, we will explore more brand new features in Selenium 4 such as Chrome DevTools Protocol, and Observability, and Enhanced Exceptions.</p>
