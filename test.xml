										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>As a New York City public school teacher, I taught general music classes to up to 50 students, each with varying degrees of ability and readiness to learn. Fast forward 12 years: As a new people manager, I had to hire 25 QA engineers at Salesforce.org, all with <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/qa-testing-careers-tb/test-automation-qa-career?lx=rI_Ys9&#038;utm_source=techbeacon&#038;utm_medium=referral&#038;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">varying degrees of technical and domain experience</a>. </p>
<p>I knew this would be a challenge. How would I address the unique needs of my team while building everyone&#8217;s competencies? </p>
<p>My answer: Go back to my educational roots. Reading articles about management reminded me that I had <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/10-ways-build-highly-effective-devops-teams" rel="noopener noreferrer">many effective strategies</a> in my toolbox to deal with just such a situation. Differentiated instruction is an educational method practiced for a century (formalized by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carol-tomlinson-19bb8716/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Carol Ann Tomlinson</a>), proposing that students do best when classroom instruction is adjusted based on their needs. </p>
<p>To meet the diverse needs of my new team and help them grow, I drew on this work, as well as communication strategies from <a target="_blank" href="https://psychcentral.com/lib/an-overview-of-dialectical-behavior-therapy/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dialectical Behavioral Therapy</a> (DBT, developed by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/DrLinehan" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Marsha Linehan</a>), and developed a strategy I call &#8220;differentiated management.&#8221;</p>
<p>This strategy will help you keep valued team members on board and help struggling members become better, all while continuing to manage your organization and meet deliverables. Here&#8217;s a crash course.</p>
<h3><strong>How to practice differentiated management </strong></h3>
<p>Differentiated management is based on the assumption that every team member comes to work with her or his own experiences, strengths, and weaknesses. The strategy works by helping managers learn how to differentiate content, process, and products by learning more about their employees. Of course, the workplace has a different dynamic than the classroom, so implementing these strategies requires a more nuanced approach. </p>
<p>On an engineering team, content is the information and materials we provide the team to do their jobs. Process is the means by which the team accomplishes the job, whether it&#8217;s a design, bug fix, built-in testability, or wholesale process changes to make working easier for all team members.</p>
<p>Product is the outcome of the work, and it&#8217;s the area where we as managers can be flexible. This may include more agile approaches around work planning to deliver smaller pieces more quickly; it may also include flexibility in reporting or documentation.</p>
<p>The difficult part of practicing differentiated management is not what to change; what you can change in the content, process, or product is somewhat limited in a software delivery context. However, the difficulty lies in knowing how best to make changes for your organization and the unique team environment in which you work.</p>
<p>Traditional people management strategies tend to focus on a one-size-fits-all approach, or tend toward stereotypes of employees: the difficult employee, the workaholic, etc.</p>
<p>The differentiated management strategy focuses instead on complex, multiple aspects of the individual within the context of the other people on the team, in the current working environment.</p>
<h3>Learning three elements about employees</h3>
<p>Knowing how to make changes that will strengthen your team while getting maximum effectiveness requires knowing about three elements—employee readiness, interests, and lived experiences—to help you make the right choices for each person and for your whole team, in nearly any situation.</p>
<p>Gauging employee readiness involves taking the time to assess your team members from the first moment you meet them, and ensuring that you know where they are with their personal and professional skills. Then, you can provide advice when they are struggling, and give appropriate stretch challenges for their growth and development.</p>
<p>Knowing about employee interests can help you to motivate employees when they are stuck, and to work with employees on stretch assignments that will help them to strengthen their skills while remaining motivated.</p>
<p>More now than ever, understanding and creating safe spaces for your team to share their lived experiences is critical to helping team members achieve their highest potential. Some aspects of the lived experience are very difficult to address in a work setting, and it isn&#8217;t necessary to do so in most cases.</p>
<p>However, understanding the physical, emotional, mental, or social challenges an employee may be facing can help to resolve interpersonal difficulties or other <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-retain-diverse-software-engineering-teams" rel="noopener noreferrer">nuanced aspects of people management</a> that are frequently ignored because they are difficult. The differentiated management methodology provides strategies to address more personal aspects of the work environment with empathy and compassion.</p>
<h3><strong>Benefits and challenges of differentiated management</strong></h3>
<p>There are many benefits of differentiated management. With my teams, I have observed increased personal and professional growth, as well as increased resilience in the face of the health, social, and political pressures we have all faced over the past year. </p>
<p>However, this management technique is not plug-and-play. The hardest part of differentiated management is that it requires an investment of time involving effective and intentional communication strategies. Regular communication, empathetic listening, and strategic problem-solving are all skills reinforced in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.teachcode.org/manage.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">my workshop</a>, and you must practice them regularly and consistently if you want to succeed.</p>
<p><em>During my <a target="_blank" href="https://well.tc/5d5x" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">STAREAST Virtual+ conference</a> session, I&#8217;ll offer more details on how you can use differentiated management. The conference runs October 5-8, 2020. I hope to see you there.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Election 2020 – Five Tips to Secure a Mail-In Ballot That Counts</strong></h2>
<p>Forecasts predict that roughly 80 million votes will get cast by mail-in ballots—double the number cast by mail in the 2016 election. Here are a couple tips to make sure your vote counts for the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Smart use of the internet will help you cast a mail-in ballot that counts.</p>
<p>Projections abound, yet forecasts predict that roughly 80 million votes will get cast by mail-in ballots—double the number cast by mail in the 2016 election. While we’ll only know the final tally of mail-in voters sometime after election day, what we know right now is that <a target="_blank" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/511472-nearly-75-percent-of-us-voters-can-vote-by-mail-in-2020-nyt" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly 75% of U.S. voters will be able to vote by mail in the 2020 election</a></p>
<p>If you’re one of those voters, or know someone who is, this quick five-point primer of online resources should help.</p>
<h3><strong>Fake ballots, the pandemic and other election concerns</strong></h3>
<p>Pew Research found that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/election-2020-voters-are-highly-engaged-but-nearly-half-expect-to-have-difficulties-voting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Americans are split 50/50 as to whether voting in the 2020 election will be “easy” or “hard.”</a> Compare that to the 2018 figures where 85% said that voting would be “easy” in that election. We can chalk that up to several factors this year, most notably <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/u-s-election-2020-dont-let-covid-19-misinformation-suppress-your-vote/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the effect of the pandemic on voting, which I touched on in my blog last week</a>.</p>
<p>However, there are other concerns at play. We’ve seen concerns about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/election-security-officials-find-no-evidence-of-coordinated-fraud-with-mail-in-ballots/" rel="noopener noreferrer">mail-in ballot fraud</a>, along with confusion about how to get a mail-in ballot, and yet further confusion as to who is eligible to get a mail-in ballot in the first place… just to name a few.</p>
<p>These concerns all share a common remedy: the facts.</p>
<p>Good information, direct from your state election officials, will point the way. Skip social media altogether. It is <strong>not</strong> a trusted resource. In all, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/fbi-director-says-its-a-mistake-to-get-election-information-on-social-media/" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s a mistake to get any election information on social media</a>, according to F.B.I. Director, Christopher Wray. Instead, let’s point ourselves in the right direction.</p>
<h3><strong>Cast your mail-in ballot securely with these five tips:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">Refer to your state and local officials for guidance</a>: Visiting your state’s election website and resources they offer is your best bet for clearing up any questions about your eligibility to vote by mail or to report any difficulties you may have.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mistakes-that-can-disqualify-your-mail-absentee-ballot-2020-9" rel="noopener noreferrer">Follow the directions closely</a>: Mail-in ballots, and the rules for filling them out, also vary from state to state. Get to know yours with a visit to your state’s election website. Common errors like failing to get a witness signature (or signatures), failing to slip your ballot into a second security envelope, or using the wrong colored pen are all examples of ways ballots can get disqualified in some states. And when you get your ballot, read it closely before you start—including the mailing or drop off instructions.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot-deadlines/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Know your election timeline</a>: Deadlines are everything—such as when you can apply for an absentee or mail-in ballot, when they need to be returned or postmarked, and if you have other drop off options other than the mail. Again, your state or local election website will clearly call all that out.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://about.usps.com/what/government-services/election-mail/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Give the mail extra time</a>: Don’t leave your vote to chance. Request your mail-in ballot, as needed, right away. Once you’ve filled it out, get it in the mail early. <a target="_blank" href="https://about.usps.com/what/government-services/election-mail/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The U.S. Postal Service has an entire site dedicated to election mail</a> that’s loaded with plenty of good advice for mail-in voters, whether you’re stateside, overseas, or deployed elsewhere with the military.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">Track your ballot</a>: The ability and means to track your ballot will of course vary from state to state. However, checking in with your state’s election website will show you what your options are.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>In this series on Selenium 4, we are providing use cases and code samples to explore the upcoming changes to the WebDriver API.</p>
<p>In the previous blog post, we discussed <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/selenium-4-migration/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Migrating to Selenium 4</a> and today we’ll detail how to install Selenium 4 so that you can check out all of the new features!</p>
<p>While Selenium has various language bindings, Java and JavaScript are the most widely used, so this post will cover how to install these two bindings. </p>
<h2 id="h.fk76atsed8kb">Upgrading from Selenium 3 to Selenium 4</h2>
<p>If you are already using Selenium with Maven, you can upgrade it to Selenium 4 by changing the Selenium version to 4. Refer to line 28 in the example below:</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/ShamaUgale/649056e1b9aaee89c197c8255735014d.js</p>
</div>
<p>If you are already using Selenium with Gradle, you can upgrade it to Selenium 4 by changing the Selenium version to 4 as shown on line 17 in the example below:</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/ShamaUgale/f95716c6055ed7e0c36446e4448832fe.js</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h.qaztmu93jjfr">Installing Fresh Instance of Selenium 4</h2>
<p>Before beginning, make sure <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Java</a> is installed on your machine and the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set in your system path.</p>
<p>The Selenium Java binding can be set up in two different ways: via build tools, or manually. I’ll outline the steps for both. However, you only need to choose one approach.</p>
<h2 id="h.286ybc3i9fp4">Install Selenium via build tools</h2>
<p>There are various Java build tools available to manage the build and dependencies; the most popular and widely used ones are <a target="_blank" href="https://maven.apache.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maven</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://gradle.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gradle</a>.</p>
<h3 id="h.gyatfl6dwyxt">Install and setup Maven</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://maven.apache.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maven</a> is a build and dependency management tool for Java based application development which helps with complete build lifecycle management.</p>
<p>Maven is also available with the Java IDEs (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc) as a plugin.</p>
<p>However, if you are not using the plugin, you can <a target="_blank" href="https://maven.apache.org/install.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">install Maven manually</a>.</p>
<h3 id="h.1a32hgmri4or">Download Selenium using Maven</h3>
<p>Maven looks for a pom.xml file for information on project, configuration, dependencies and plugins etc.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://mvnrepository.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maven Central Repository</a> is the place where all the dependencies/libraries for all versions can be found. We can search for a library and copy and paste the dependency into our pom.xml file to download them.</p>
<p>For example, <a target="_blank" href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-java/4.0.0-alpha-6" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium 4</a> can be downloaded using maven by adding the dependencies in pom.xml as shown in the below sample.</p>
<h3 id="h.65zyh85i6goy">Test Setup</h3>
<p>You are now all set to write tests and run them through the IDE or through the command line. You can test the setup, by adding the following code snippet into a new Java class under the ‘src’ directory.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/ShamaUgale/7c057b0b2f37f240d749948c1c66fd99.js</p>
</div>
<h3 id="h.2kbbqkai3riu">Install and setup Gradle</h3>
<p>Gradle is another popular build tool used for java based applications these days. It’s open source and the build scripts can be written in Groovy or Kotlin DSL.</p>
<p>Gradle can be also installed as a plugin in Java IDEs (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc).</p>
<p>However, if you are not using the plugin, you can <a target="_blank" href="https://gradle.org/releases/" rel="noopener noreferrer">install Gradle manually.</a></p>
<h3 id="h.9xixdw5vjipj">Download Selenium using Gradle</h3>
<p>Gradle looks for a build.gradle file where all the dependencies, plugins and build scripts are written.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://mvnrepository.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maven Central Repository</a> is the place where all the dependencies/libraries for all versions can be found for Gradle as well. We can search for a library and copy and paste the dependency from the Gradle tab into our build.gradle file to download them.</p>
<p>For example, <a target="_blank" href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-java/4.0.0-alpha-6" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium 4</a> can be downloaded using gradle by adding the dependencies in build.gradle file as shown in the below sample.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/ShamaUgale/f95716c6055ed7e0c36446e4448832fe.js</p>
</div>
<h3 id="h.g8uteny7ordn">Test Setup</h3>
<p>You are now all set to write tests and run them through the IDE or through the command line. You can test the setup, by adding the following code snippet into a new Java class under the ‘src’ directory and build.gradle file in the project root directory.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/ShamaUgale/7c057b0b2f37f240d749948c1c66fd99.js</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h.ubq2cxgrs28c">Install Selenium manually</h2>
<h3 id="h.aln68tka5bu">Download Selenium</h3>
<p>The jar files for Selenium 4 Java bindings can be downloaded from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Selenium downloads page</a>.</p>
<p>It will be downloaded as a zip file, unzip it.</p>
<p>Selenium scripts can be executed on various platforms, namely Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera and Edge. To explore and install the drivers for each refer to documentation links under the “Browsers” section on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Downloads</a> page.</p>
<h3 id="h.co9wdewg63t4">Add Selenium to IntelliJ</h3>
<p>Within IntelliJ:</p>
<p>Go to the File Menu <strong>→ </strong> Project Structure <strong>→</strong> Modules <strong>→</strong> Dependencies <strong>→ </strong>Click on ‘+’ Sign <strong>-→</strong> Select JARs or directories → Select all the Selenium jar files and click on OK button.</p>
<p>Also, add the downloaded browser drivers under the project directory. In our example we will add chromedriver to run our tests on Chrome browser.</p>
<h3 id="h.f26x0ghi5inj">Test Setup</h3>
<p>Create a new Java file under the ‘src’ directory and add this code:</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/ShamaUgale/7c057b0b2f37f240d749948c1c66fd99.js</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h.io12x11o4py0">JavaScript</h2>
<p>You can download and manage the Selenium JavaScript bindings using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">npm</a>.</p>
<h3 id="h.jlit051y773w">Install NodeJs and NPM</h3>
<p>As a prerequisite, <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer">NodeJs</a> needs to be <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" rel="noopener noreferrer">downloaded</a> and installed on the machine. To verify the installation, use the below two commands</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">node -v</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">npm -v</pre>
<p>Both should give the current version installed as an output.</p>
<h3 id="h.fzofgafoa6c">Download and install Selenium Webdriver</h3>
<p>Using the below command we will install Selenium with npm package manager on your machine.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">npm install -g selenium-webdriver</pre>
<p>Additionally, to run the tests on the browsers (Chrome, Firefox and IE etc), browser drivers need to be downloaded and set in the system path.</p>
<p>The drivers can be downloaded from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Downloads</a> page and the links can be found under the “Browsers” section on the page. Windows users may add the driver path to the PATH variable under environment variables. Mac and Linux users need to add a driver path to the $PATH variable in the shell.</p>
<p>Once we have installed the Selenium libraries and set the path for the browsers, we need to add the package.json file to the project root directory. NPM requires this file to install the dependencies and plugins used to build the project along with running the tests.</p>
<p>package.json can be created either manually or running the below command which adds the file to the current directory it is run from.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"> npm init</pre>
<p>Below sample package.json file can be referred for installing Selenium 4 and running our tests. If you are already using Selenium Javascript bindings, to upgrade to Selenium 4, change the version as shown on line 12 in the below sample build file.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/ShamaUgale/292fdb8bea71215593ba5396e79033e8.js</p>
</div>
<p>Once you have updated the Selenium 4 dependencies in the package.json file, run the below command to install all dependencies defined in your package.json file under dependencies section.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">npm install</pre>
<p>The test is written in “googleSearchTest.js” file. Below is the sample code, which opens a Firefox browser, navigates to google.com and searches for “Selenium 4” and hits ENTER.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/ShamaUgale/c20bdc0dc70e19737e0dfcbe29d9d826.js</p>
</div>
<p>To execute the test use the below command</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">node googleSearchTest</pre>
<h2 id="h.tinlhet1cle">Summary</h2>
<p>We went through the setup instructions for Selenium 4 for two most popular language bindings – Java and JavaScript with ready to use sample tests and build files.</p>
<p>Now that we are ready with the Selenium 4 setup on our machine, in the next post of this series, we will explore the newly added features offered in Selenium 4 and the benefits they provide with working code samples.</p>

</p>
<div>
<p>When discussing AI in test automation, you might be thinking: “Oh well, here’s another buzzword in our testing field”… But let’s face it, AI (Artificial Intelligence) “buzzword” keeps on coming up over the past couple of years and seems to be here to stay, and rapidly transforming the testing landscape. Instead of being intimidated by the change, let’s embrace it, and what better way than with a <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">solution</a> that has AI built into its technology <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>TestProject recently added <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/08/25/testprojects-smart-recorder-adds-ai-powered-self-healing-technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI powered Self Healing technology</a> to its Selenium-based Smart Test Recorder. Since TestProject is built on top of Selenium, you now can get the benefits of Selenium with additional AI features to save a bunch of time and overcome the most common and difficult testing challenges, and all 100% for free.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, we were thrilled to host 800+ eager webinar participants to demonstrate this AI technology of TestProject. We collected dozens of questions over the 1-hour session, and have answered the most common questions for you below.</p>
<p>The following Q&#038;As can shed light over how AI works in test automation in general, and particularly when utilizing TestProject <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2><strong>Out-of-the-box AI Self Healing Technology</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I view the full webinar recording?</strong><br />A: Directly from our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/testproject" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject YouTube channel</a>, or here:</p>
<p> <iframe title="[Webinar Recording] Introducing The TestProject New AI Powered Self Healing Technology" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H45aSXTPDdg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Q: How do the AI self-healing features work?</strong><br />A: <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a>’s AI works for you, both during the Recording &#038; Execution of your tests!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When recording a test</strong>, you will be notified if there’s a better, more stable way, to run the test and allow you to review and confirm the proposed changes.</li>
<li><strong>When executing a test</strong>, if a self-healing mechanism was used to recover from an error, an indication will appear in your report.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q: Is this a native built-in option, or should I install some Addon?</strong><br />A: TestProject AI-powered Self Healing technology is built-in the Web Test Recorder. No need to install anything other than the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-agents/what-is-a-testproject-agent" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject Agent</a>. Just make sure you are using Agent version 0.64.0 or higher.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is the self-healing capability available also within the Mobile Test Recorder as well as the Web Test Recorder?</strong><br />A: It will be added to the Mobile Test Recorder by Q4.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I need to reinstall/upgrade the TestProject Agent to access the new AI self-healing version?</strong><br />A: You simply need to install/update your TestProject Agent to version 0.64.0 or higher.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I have to use the AI features? Can I modify the AI-selected locator?</strong><br />A: TestProject’s AI features are designed to be non-intrusive. You can always override suggested locators with your own by making them primary or removing the automatically generated ones. In addition, you can always change (or remove) any alternative strategies from the elements management page.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the benefits of these AI Self-Healing capabilities?</strong><br />A: This revolutionary technology provides a number of new capabilities to further enhance the Smart Test Recorder, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic Self-Healing capabilities, with AI to monitor your tests and select the most robust selector strategy for your elements, and can even repair tests on the fly if needed.</li>
<li>Best-in-class support for iFrames, Popups, Dynamic Elements and more. Learn more about how we help overcome these challenges in <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/09/01/overcome-7-selenium-challenges-with-testprojects-smart-recorder/" rel="noopener noreferrer">this tutorial</a>.</li>
<li>Streamlined user interface, accelerating test creation and management of advanced features like <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Addons</a>, parameters, and more.</li>
<li>Improved performance, for lightning-quick test creation, element identification, and test debugging.</li>
<li>Full compatibility with the most complex enterprise web apps, including Salesforce, SAP Fiori, MS Sharepoint, and ServiceNow.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/05/04/testproject-adaptive-wait-capability/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adaptive-Wait</a> automatically handles deviations in web application loading times.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q: Does TestProject support objects within iFrames and enables them to switch back to normal frame objects?</strong><br />A: Yes, TestProject’s AI-powered test recorder supports iFrames out-of-the-box, you don’t need to do anything special for that.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do we need to perform any auto-adjust when the iFrame loads in a dynamic position or in a resized height?</strong><br />A: No, there is no need to adjust anything since the iFrames are supported automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens if the element locators are changed? Will the test still proceed or will it fail?</strong><br />A: For each element, TestProject’s AI will search for the most stable locator before proceeding with the test, as more than a single locator is stored for each element.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is there something special we need to do in order to enable this AI self-healing technology? </strong><br />A: The self-healing will work automatically and it will work on all types of locators.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is there an element repository? Meaning, if “name2” is broken across many tests, is there a way to update in ONE place for all tests that use the element?</strong><br />A: Yes, with TestProject’s Page Object Model, all of your elements are stored in one streamlined repository in the “Elements” section within each Project.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is there an indicator on the test reports of the self-healing that occurred?</strong><br />A: Each test step that was self-healed has a heart icon to represent it on the test report. See below an example of the heart icon on step 2 &#038; 3:</p>

<p><strong>Q: How is it possible to save the CSS locator when recording an element? By default, is it the XPath that is saved? Can we filter which type of locator the AI will be looking for? For instance, only CSS or only XPath?</strong><br />A: By default, we will save more than one locator for each element (both CSS/XPath). If you want to override the default locator with a custom attribute, or a combination of custom attributes, you can do it on the application level – that will force the recorder to look for a custom attribute first Here is a <a target="_blank" href="https://intercom.help/testprojectio/en/articles/4449063-setting-application-s-custom-attributes" rel="noopener noreferrer">short tutorial</a> of how to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the best way to identify elements on a web page? Should we use ID, XPath, or unique attributes like “data-qa”?</strong><br />A: TestProject’s Smart Test Recorder will automatically identify the best locators based on your application layout (typically more than one). You can always edit each element to learn what are the best locator strategies it picks for you. If you do the mapping manually, then ID’s, Custom CSS, and Custom attributes are preferred.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens if the AI Self-healing cannot find an element?</strong><br />A: If an element cannot be located, the step will fail and probably for a good reason <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will the self-healing work at all times? Are there any challenges or scenarios in which the self-healing will fail to work?</strong><br />A: Yes, if the element completely changed its characterization in more than one way, we will prefer to fail the step where the certainty is not high and you might get false-positive results.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are the AI self-healing capabilities available only within the Test Recorder, or also when developing coded tests with the TestProject <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/14/announcing-testproject-new-opensdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenSDK</a>?</strong><br />A: At this point, these capabilities are available within the Smart Test Recorder only.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is TestProject really offering all of this for free? Is it Open Source?</strong><br />A: TestProject is part of Tricentis, a well-funded company that is the leader in software testing. This provides the resources to create tools to offer TestProject at no cost to our users, for the benefit of giving back to the testing community. TestProject is based on open source (Selenium and Appium) and its SDK is 100% open source.

<p>A common complaint that I hear is: “My tests run a lot faster locally than on Sauce Labs.”</p>
<p>Sauce Labs is in the cloud and not in your local network, so it makes sense that any given test is going to have some amount of slowdown. The advantage of Sauce Labs is that you can make up this difference by scaling up the number of tests you run at the same time. If you are seeing individual tests taking much more than twice as long to run remotely as they do locally, then there are definitely things you can do that will improve your performance.</p>
<p>However, let’s start with an unlikely disclaimer: test speed might not be what you should be prioritizing.</p>
<div class="video">
<p><iframe title="Who Should Be Focusing on Faster Test Results?" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CvNlN6DaW0A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
</div>
<p>The goal of test automation is to get accurate results back in a consistent manner. If you are not getting accurate results, then the speed at which you get those results is not the important thing. I spoke with a team last year that wanted to decrease their run times from 9 hours to 6 hours. When I sat down to work with them on that, I asked what percent of their tests were failing. They told me 70% (!!?!??). When you have more failures than you can evaluate between test runs, your tests are effectively useless. This team had no business focusing on shaving off time on their test runs when all that will do is give them useless information faster. I’m not saying performance isn’t important, and there are some things that you can do to improve performance that will also improve reliability, but in general, focus on the most important thing first. Essentially, spend your time reducing “maintenance costs” rather than focusing on “execution costs.”</p>
<p>There are a number of improvements that might make a difference—like moving your testing servers closer to the Sauce Labs data center, and turning off video capture and screenshots—which aren’t worth the time savings. You might have errors that are entirely preventable and should never happen that are taking up time that could be spent running other tests. There are some powerful things that you might not know about that you can do with a proxy like Sauce Connect for reducing overall traffic and decreasing the amount of internet that some assets need to travel. Finally, many people don’t realize that their frameworks are likely optimized for local execution and are very inefficient when running against any remote server.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, I&#8217;ll be walking you through some ways that you can speed up your tests, including parallel testing, eliminating time-wasting errors, and more! Stay tuned for future posts that will include code and video with screencasts.</p>

<h2><strong> Special Delivery: Don’t Fall for the USPS SMiShing Scam</strong></h2>
<p>According to Statista, 3.5 billion people worldwide are forecasted to own a smartphone by the end of 2020. These connected devices allow us to have a wealth of apps and information constantly at our fingertips – empowering us to remain in constant contact with loved ones, make quick purchases, track our fitness progress, you name it. Hackers are all too familiar with our reliance on our smartphones – and are eager to exploit them with stealthy tricks as a result.</p>
<p>One recent example of these tricks? Suspicious text messages claiming to be from USPS. According to <a target="_blank" href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/Dkk1CzKnJIR00kmS4mijw?domain=gizmodo.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gizmodo</a>, a recent SMS phishing scam is using the USPS name and fraudulent tracking codes to trick users into clicking on malicious links.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into the details of this scheme, what it means for users, and what you can do to protect yourself from SMS phishing.</p>
<h3>Special Delivery: Suspicious Text Messages</h3>
<p>To orchestrate this phishing scheme, hackers send out text messages from random numbers claiming that a user’s delivery from USPS, FedEx, or another delivery service is experiencing a transit issue that requires urgent attention. If the user clicks on the link in the text, the link will direct them to a form fill page asking them to fill in their personal and financial information to “verify their purchase delivery.” If the form is completed, the hacker could exploit that information for financial gain.</p>
<p>However, scammers also use this phishing scheme to infect users’ devices with malware. For example, some users received links claiming to provide access to a supposed USPS shipment. Instead, they were led to a domain that did nothing but infect their browser or phone with malware. Regardless of what route the hacker takes, these scams leave the user in a situation that compromises their smartphone and personal data.</p>

<h3>Don’t Fall for Delivery Scams</h3>
<p>While delivery alerts are a convenient way to track packages, it’s important to familiarize yourself with the signs of phishing scams – especially as we approach the holiday shopping season. Doing so will help you safeguard your online security without sacrificing the convenience of your smartphone. To do just that, follow these actionable steps to help secure your devices and data from SMiShing schemes:</p>
<h3>Go directly to the source</h3>
<p>Be skeptical of text messages claiming to be from companies with peculiar asks or information that seems too good to be true. Instead of clicking on a link within the text, it’s best to go straight to the organization’s website to check on your delivery status or contact customer service.</p>
<h3>Enable the feature on your mobile device that blocks certain texts</h3>
<p>Many spammers send texts from an internet service in an attempt to hide their identities. Combat this by using the feature on your mobile device that blocks texts sent from the internet or unknown users. For example, you can disable all potential <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-block-robotexts-and-spam-messages" rel="noopener noreferrer">spam messages</a> from the Messages app on an Android device by navigating to Settings, clicking on Spam protection, and turning on the Enable spam protection switch. Learn more about how you can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-block-robotexts-and-spam-messages" rel="noopener noreferrer">block robotexts and spam messages</a> on your device.</p>
<h3>Use mobile security software</h3>
<p>Prepare your mobile devices for any threat coming their way. To do just that, cover these devices with an extra layer of protection via a mobile security solution, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/android.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee Mobile Security.</a></p>
