<p><strong>Apple and Google are under fire yet again</strong> for allowing scam apps into their curated app stores: Apple for permitting useless clone apps that sneakily charge recurring fees, and Google for not dealing with once-good apps that go rogue.</p>
<p><strong>There are no good app stores.</strong> There, I said it. Change my mind.</p>
<p><strong>It’s all about the mighty dollar.</strong> In this week’s <i><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/contributors/richi-jennings" rel="noopener">Security Blogwatch</a></i>, we follow the money.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://richi.uk/" rel="noopener nofollow" title="Richi Jennings">Your humble blogwatcher</a> curated these bloggy bits for your entertainment. Not to mention: <em>BOOM.</em></p>
<h3>A plague on both your houses</h3>
<p><strong>What’s the craic?</strong> Dan Goodin reports—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/android-barcode-scanner-with-10-million-downloads-infects-users/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Android barcode scanner with 10 million+ downloads infects users</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Barcode Scanner, one of dozens of such apps available in the official Google app repository, began its life as a legitimate offering. Then in late December … ads were opening out of nowhere. … An update delivered in December included code that was responsible for the bombardment.<br />…<br />Google [has] removed the app. … So far, however, Google has yet to use its Google Play Protect tool to remove the app from devices that had it installed. … Anyone who has a barcode scanner installed on an Android device should inspect it.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>How can we tell?</strong> Thomas Claburn explainifies—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/08/barcode_scan_app_malwarebytes_update/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Barcode scan app amassed millions of downloads before weird update</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Barcode Scanner, distributed by a London-based company called LavaBird, received an update on December 4, 2020, that appears to have introduced the code in question. … LavaBird&#8217;s now-banished Android app shouldn&#8217;t be confused with ZXing Team&#8217;s Barcode Scanner that remains in the Play Store.<br />…<br />LavaBird … is run by Dmytro Kizema, a resident of Ukraine. [It] was incorporated in March, 2020 [but] those involved appear to have been using variations on that name for several years and have other apps that they use to sell traffic to advertisers.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Who discovered it?</strong> Nathan Collier slightly over-hypes the scale of the problem—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/android/2021/02/barcode-scanner-app-on-google-play-infects-10-million-users-with-one-update/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Barcode Scanner app on Google Play infects 10 million users with one update</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Late last December we started getting a distress call. … One patron, who goes by username Anon00, discovered that it was coming from a long-time installed app, Barcode Scanner. An app that has 10,000,000+ installs from Google Play.<br />…<br />We predict … the update occurred on December 4th. … Malicious code had been added that was not in previous versions of the app. Furthermore, the added code used heavy obfuscation to avoid detection. … We confirmed it had been signed by the same digital certificate as previous clean versions.<br />…<br />It is frightening that with one update an app can turn malicious while going under the radar of Google Play Protect. … Because there are so many other legitimate barcode and QR scanners on Google Play, [here’s the] app information:<br />Publisher: LavaBird LTD<br />App Name: Barcode Scanner<br />MD5: A922F91BAF324FA07B3C40846EBBFE30<br />Package Name: com.qrcodescanner.barcodescanner.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>As opposed to other apps with the same name?</strong> Thus spake <i><a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/android-barcode-scanner-with-10-million-downloads-infects-users/?comments=1&amp;post=39646011#comment-39646011" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">marsilies</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>I use an app called &#8220;Barcode Scanner&#8221; that&#8217;s not the malware app. However, the recent reviews blast it for adware, which I haven&#8217;t noticed. I think having the exact same name has caused some people to post negative reviews on the wrong app.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>As wooped</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26063924" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">wooptoo</a></i>, too: <em>[You’re fired—Ed.]</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>This is possibly tied to the recent assault on the ZXing Barcode scanner app. This is a legit open source app that&#8217;s been recently flooded by 1-star reviews claiming that the app contains malware, probably in order to get users to switch to the other apps.</p>
<p>The funny thing is this app has not been updated since 2019 on the Play Store, so those reviews are clearly bogus. It takes a special kind of scum to slander an open source project in order to push malware.</p>
<p></em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>And this problem isn’t unique to Android.</strong> Tim Hardwick explains—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/scam-apps-ios-making-millions-revenue/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Scam iOS Apps Still Raking in Millions in Revenue on App Store</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>The problem of scam iOS apps has dogged Apple&#8217;s App Store for some years now. … Scammers prey on and exploit the work of genuine app developers. … The developer Kosta Eleftheriou has taken to Twitter to highlight that the problem remains as big as ever in at least some app categories – and also offered iOS users a way to spot them.<br />…<br />According to Eleftheriou, there are several clones of his … app, but one of the most clear non-functional rip-offs … launched with a blank interface and an &#8220;Unlock now&#8221; button. Tapping the button prompted users to confirm an $8/week subscription—for an app that doesn&#8217;t do anything.<br />…<br />[He said] the scam achieved prominence in the App Store by gaming Apple&#8217;s algorithmic ranking system through the purchase of fake ratings and glowing five-star reviews, which bumped it up to the top of its app category. It even advertised its software using his own promotional video.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Old news, I hear you cry?</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26069947" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">alex331</a></i> counts the days:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It&#8217;s been a week since this issue [was] highlighted. And a week since Apple still hasn&#8217;t said a single thing. This is sad.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>IANAL, and neither is</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=18218238&amp;cid=61041426" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Anubis IV</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Not a lawyer here, but it even seems as if there may be a case for fraud. … If they&#8217;re stealing someone else&#8217;s videos, posting them as their own, delivering a non-functioning app, and charging users $8/week for the privilege of using said app, the App Store might be well-served by Apple going after them in court.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Cui bono?</strong> With an eye on Apple’s 30%, <i><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26054879" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">ekurutepe</a></i> blames Tim Apple:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I&#8217;m sure Apple wants to do the right thing but they&#8217;ve set themselves up badly from the top down in this case: Tim Cook has been promising (and delivering) services revenue and subscriber count growth since 2016. If your employer says services revenue growth is the most important thing, people do respond to incentives even if they&#8217;re aware of it or not.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Meanwhile,</strong> what’s the best way to curate an app store? <i><a target="_blank" href="https://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=18208056&amp;cid=61036706" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">arglebargle_xiv</a></i> comment YOU:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Google method is much more economical. Google asks Google Play authors, &#8220;Are you Russian hacker?&#8221; and if reply is &#8220;Nyet!&#8221; then app gets approved.</em></p></blockquote>
<h3>The moral of the story?</h3>
<p>Watch out for scam clones of your app, and for bad reviews targeting similarly named apps.</p>
<h3>And finally</h3>

<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>In November last year, we lost our much-loved family dog. We were all so devasted. Harley was a very handsome black and white Cavoodle who died from a paralysis tick bite after giving us 12 years of love. After lots of tears and weeks of sadness, we have decided it’s time to start our search for another fur baby.</p>
<p>But it seems we are not the only ones in the market for a new puppy. Thanks to COVID and our new very home focussed lives, puppies have been in hot demand since early 2020 and they still are. What better way to deal with lockdown loneliness and a home-based existence than a brand-new ball of fluff!</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks, I’ve spoken to multiple breeders from all around Australia who have over 50 families waiting for a puppy! A Portuguese Water Dog breeder told me yesterday that it would be 2023 before she could offer me a puppy!! So,</p>
<p>And this trend hasn’t gone unnoticed by cybercriminals with <a target="_blank" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/life/2020/11/24/puppy-prices-peak-as-scams-increase-fourfold-on-last-year/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) reporting a four-fold increase in puppy scams in 2020!! In fact, a whopping $1.6 million was scammed from unsuspecting Aussies simply looking for a ball of fur to love between January and October 2020.</a></p>
<p>So, how do you avoid being caught up in a puppy scam and losing money? Here’s what I’m doing to ensure we don’t get swindled while we search for our new puppy:</p>
<h2><strong>1. Take Your Time</strong></h2>
<p>Cybercriminals rely on us being in a rush and not doing our homework. A quick google search for popular dog breeds such as Cavoodles, Labradors or Dachshunds will yield pages of results, not all of them legit!</p>
<p>Scammers are very talented at making their sites look genuine. They will copy photos of puppies and breeders from legitimate sites and will even use certificates and identification numbers from these legitimate breeders too. Quite often the only detail that differs is the contact telephone number and email address.</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram ads are also created using these details too making it very hard to identify what is legitimate and what isn’t.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Do Your Homework</strong></h2>
<p>Doing your due diligence is the best way to prevent becoming a victim of a puppy scam. Even if the person on the end of the phone sounds delightful and the pictures are gorgeous, you owe it to yourself – and your bank account – to ensure you are dealing with a legitimate breeder. Here’s what I recommend you do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google the name of the breeder to ascertain whether they have NOT been caught up in a scam.</li>
<li>Always ring the association that the breeder says they are registered with and crosscheck all the information you have been given.</li>
<li>As most puppies come vaccinated and microchipped, ask the breeder to share contact details of the veterinary clinic the puppy has been to.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>3. Photos and Video Chat</strong></h2>
<p>If you are not able to pick up your pet in person, requesting photos and even a video call with the breeder and your potential puppy is essential.</p>
<p>Ask the breeder for multiple photos of the pet with specific items – this help you ascertain that the pet is real and not photoshopped. A recent newspaper is a great item to suggest.</p>
<p>However, a video call is probably the best way of giving you total piece of mind. Yes, it maybe crazy and noisy but there’s nothing like seeing something with your own eyes to satisfy yourself that it is real and not photoshopped!</p>
<h2><strong>4. Trust Your Gut</strong></h2>
<p>We all have a 6<sup>th</sup> sense and now is the time to use it:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the breeder is trying to push for the sale as they are moving to a new house or are unwell, be suspicious.</li>
<li>If the breeder is putting pressure on you to deposit funds to secure your puppy ASAP, be suspicious.</li>
<li>If the breeder is asking an inflated price for the pet, be suspicious. Do your research so you know what an average asking price would be.</li>
<li>If email communication with breeder has signs of broken English or poor grammar, be very suspicious.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can’t imagine our family without pets. They play such an important, cohesive role and we take such joy in sharing photos of our crazy cats and their weird antics on our family group chat.</p>
<p>Next week, we are going to pickup our new puppy. After much debate about breeds, we have chosen a tri coloured beaglier – male of course! The breeder sounds delightful over the phone and the pictures are gorgeous. But just to ensure total piece of mind, I am driving nearly 7 hours to pick up our new fur baby in person. I’ll be sure to share some photos!</p>
<p>Happy pet shopping!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Multi-cloud success is more about what lies between the clouds than what&#8217;s on the clouds themselves. These critical layers of software that exist between the heterogeneous mix of clouds your enterprise uses will need your full attention in the coming year.</p>
<p>First, though, remember the primary <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-multi-cloud-approach-gaining-such-popularity" rel="noopener">reasons most enterprises choose multi-cloud</a> to begin with. The most obvious benefit is that multi-cloud can leverage best-of-breed cloud services from all of the providers. Next is the opportunity to save money, and third is the ability to avoid vendor lock-in. </p>
<p>On the flip side, <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/hybrid-multicloud-management-tb/manage-cloud-complexity?lx=ooPdGt&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">multi-cloud&#8217;s operational complexity</a> can outpace its benefits when compared to enterprises that leverage a single public cloud deployment. However, more and more enterprises require certain features of multi-cloud that can offset the complexity issues, if managed correctly.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to know to minimize complexity to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/hybrid-multicloud-management-tb/ease-multi-cloud-management?lx=ooPdGt&amp;custom_url=hybrid-multicloud-management-tb%2Fmanage-cloud-complexity&amp;amp;utm_campaign=00172425&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=techbeacon" rel="noopener">make multi-cloud work</a> at peak performance levels.</p>
<h3>Get your multi-cloud up to speed</h3>
<p>First, you need management and monitoring layers. These include AIOps, security managers, governance tooling, and other technologies that can manage and control heterogeneous cloud deployments.</p>
<p>The management and monitoring layers are just as important—perhaps even more so—than are the native services that run on those public clouds. These layers of software systems become the jumping-off point for <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/hybrid-multicloud-management-tb/hybrid-IT-management-trends?lx=ooPdGt&amp;custom_url=hybrid-multicloud-management-tb%2Fmanage-cloud-complexity&amp;amp;utm_campaign=00172425&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=techbeacon" rel="noopener">modern cloud operations</a>, and they can operate without leveraging cloud-specific systems as you move forward. </p>
<p>Second, public cloud providers are <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-cloud-operations-management-next-big-thing" rel="noopener">beginning to invest in cross-cloud solutions</a>. Most won&#8217;t mention the word <em>multi-cloud</em>, but they plan to support this architecture, nonetheless. This puts the nail in the coffin of less complex, single-cloud deployments that do not take advantage of best-of-breed. </p>
<p>Some people remain skeptical that public cloud providers will build technology that will integrate with the competition, but the providers really have no other choice. Remember when Apple and Microsoft devices could not communicate? Cloud vendors do. This is not a new trend.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s what&#8217;s in the middle that counts</h3>
<p>Enterprises will continue to move to multi-cloud as the preferred cloud deployment platform, and that move is to the middle. While each cloud&#8217;s native services are perhaps more mature than many of the cross-cloud solutions that reside in the middle, they are native to only one cloud. </p>
<p>So native services can provide an operational function or functions to the native cloud, and some have been modified to interact with other clouds, but none are purpose-built to manage other cloud brands. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a hard reality: For multi-cloud deployments to benefit from common operational services that may run from a particular cloud, the common operational services must logically exist above all cloud brands to leverage the native services of each cloud. </p>
<p>Instead of two, three, or more consoles that provide operational information from each cloud provider, you want a single user interface, both visual and API-based, that can abstract the differences in the native services from the human operators. </p>
<p>This concept applies to platform, data, and application management and monitoring services. It&#8217;s also relevant to services such as cost management, security operations, backup and recovery, user management, and tagging. Even common services such as an AI knowledge base can instantly learn from the data housed in all of the leveraged clouds.</p>
<h4>AIOps and other tools</h4>
<p>Tools vary and become a reflection of your requirements. However, <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/ai-ops-transform-it-tb/aiops-tools-implementation?lx=my3YKV&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">AIOps tooling</a> is emerging as one of the larger players. This allows you to centrally operate a multi-cloud, and it will learn how to do its job better the more it does it. The idea is to leverage abstraction and automation as much as you can to remove as many humans from the operational processes as you can.</p>
<p>Other tools that are emerging as common cross-cloud services include <a target="_blank" href="http://techbeacon.com/security/how-secure-your-cloud-infrastructure-3-planes-opsec" rel="noopener">security managers that provide identity management</a>, key management, encryption services, and others, to span all cloud brands as well as traditional systems. </p>
<p>They do this by abstracting the native security services that run in each cloud, and then they allow common processes such as authorization to be centrally managed. The downside: Many of these systems are new, all approach the problem in different ways, and thus you might have to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/hybrid-multicloud-management-tb/architect-manage-hybrid-multiclouds?lx=ooPdGt&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">adopt a mix of tools</a> instead of only one.</p>
<h3>What does the new middle mean for cloud computing?</h3>
<p>If you leverage cross-cloud solutions to operate your multi-cloud, you&#8217;ll likely experience the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced complexity: While multi-cloud deployments are vastly more complex, the use of cross-cloud tools should reduce how that increased complexity affects your operations.</li>
<li>Reduced costs: You&#8217;ll need fewer ops staffers to run the multi-cloud, since you&#8217;ll be able to operate the multi-cloud using a single, simplified interface. </li>
<li>Reduced security risks: When you reduce the complexity, SecOps will become more effective. Unified security layers that encompass traditional and cloud computing systems will continue to become more effective due to the lack of individual security systems for each silo in the enterprise. </li>
</ul>
<p>This new reality caught some enterprises by surprise: We no longer design for native cloud-based systems, but for software that runs between clouds. Enterprises will find themselves once more in charge of the software solutions that may run for a particular cloud, but the solutions will be purpose-built to provide common services across clouds, such as the examples covered above.</p>
<p>Best practices are just beginning to emerge for this new type of cloud architecture. That said, enterprises will likely make a few mistakes, and cross-cloud solutions will need to mature a bit before common services built to work across public clouds become commonplace. </p>
<h3>Steps to cloud success</h3>
<p>Cloud architects are having a hard time reaching a consensus on the best approach and technology solutions for the middle of the clouds. Pioneers are experimenting with common cloud services as a few enterprises move to migrate more than one-third of the enterprise&#8217;s workloads to a multi-cloud. </p>
<p>With best practices and approaches still in their experimental stages, the current best process is as follows.</p>
<h4>Deep planning</h4>
<p>This is often overlooked when moving to a single public cloud provider, largely because that cloud provider will not likely let you fail. The only defense against failure for multi-cloud solutions is to splurge on planning, with some initial validation testing. </p>
<p>This means creating lists of native cloud services you&#8217;ll use, and approaches and technical solutions to address common security, common governance, common management, and so on. </p>
<p>These are the harder problems to solve, considering the prior lack of interest among vendors to develop cross-cloud services, and the immaturity of current multi-cloud solutions. </p>
<p>Some of the thinking that should come out of this process includes: ops planning, SecOps planning, integration with DevOps/DevSecOps, testing, network, common data storage and management, and any number of architecture patterns that may be applicable to your needs. </p>
<h4>Deep testing  </h4>
<p>Even if a provider offers cross-cloud services using one configuration or architecture, it can&#8217;t account for all configurations that need to work and play well together. Security systems don&#8217;t provide the points of integration that most assumed were there or were untested. This becomes a limitation that can kill multi-cloud projects and/or momentum. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s the responsibility of those who deploy cross-cloud services to ensure that the solutions will work and play well together on the multi-cloud configuration you wish to use. This includes the public clouds you want to employ and the native services you want to leverage—storage, compute, database, etc.—within those public clouds. </p>
<p>You should be at least 98% certain that the solution is workable coming out of this testing process.</p>
<h4>Deep operations<i>  </i></h4>
<p>Most of what will be considered a success with multi-cloud, and multi-cloud using common cloud services, won&#8217;t be what rolls out on the first day of deployment. The longer-term achievements of consistent business services leveraged from multi-cloud will be the hallmarks of its success. </p>
<p>Operations will be the most measured aspect of multi-cloud success or failure. Businesses will leverage systems within the public clouds that they will grow to depend upon. The systems in the cloud could become the entire business. </p>
<p>This means you can&#8217;t get operations wrong at any step of deployment or at any time thereafter. Ops planning needs to lead to approaches and tools that work longer term. This means you also need to leverage a <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-use-kaizen-events-drive-lean-it-continuous-improvement" rel="noopener">continuous improvement</a> model, where the ops processes and tooling change continuously to improve ops efficiency, performance, and resiliency. </p>
<h2>Focus on the right tasks</h2>
<p>Many who plan to deploy multi-clouds focus on the wrong things. They concentrate on what native cloud services to leverage and deploy, on which public cloud, more than they evaluate common services that span public clouds. That approach will work, but it won&#8217;t scale, which means it won&#8217;t work well—and eventually it won&#8217;t work at all. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you focus on building out redundant native services on each cloud, you will create a massive amount of complexity that will lead to efficiency and security issues that could kill your multi-cloud deployment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Building in the middle of public clouds should be your focus right now. The struggle in the short term will be to find guidance to approach your middle-based, multi-cloud deployment, and what the costs and benefits will be to get a cross-cloud architecture and solution set properly funded. </p>
<p>What lies between a multi-cloud could contain the set of solutions that allow your business to become more effective in its markets and incorporate traditional systems with newer cloud-based systems. </p>
<p>There is also a larger strategic advantage to building out the middle of the clouds. You’ll be able to solve problems you have yet to get around to, such as master data management, identity-based security, and cross-platform audit systems, to name just a few. </p>
<p>If you are involved with IT, multi-cloud is in your future. The layers that lie between a multi-cloud are where the next innovations will evolve and development efforts will explode. This is the next big trend.</p>
<h4>Keep learning</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>As a test automation architect, I am always on the lookout for the best solutions that can help reduce the feedback loop between development and QA. As development cycles speed up, having the ability to release features at breakneck speed has become crucial to the success of many organizations. With software infrastructure becoming ever more complicated, and multiple teams contributing to a single application to accommodate these release cycles, the need for effective solutions to catch bugs as fast as possible has never been greater. Enter Applitools.</p>
<p>Applitools has been making waves across the test community for years now by disrupting the traditional means by which test engineers automate their solutions with more coverage, fewer lines of code, and less time spent toward test maintenance. In a stroke of genius, they have invited engineers worldwide to participate in hackathons leveraging the Applitools Ultrafast Grid to show them firsthand how powerful the tool can be. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote">
<blockquote>
<p>…standing up an automated test solution can easily take hours to lay the groundwork before you write a single test. The best part of leveraging Cypress and Applitools is that it took roughly one hour from start to finish including the development of my tests, which is almost unheard of. </p>
<p><cite>Kerry McKeever</cite></p></blockquote>
</figure>
<p>During my first Applitools hackathon, I set up my framework how I traditionally would for any company requiring strong cross-browser compatibility. To do this, I leveraged Selenium and C#, since that is what stack I had been working on for multiple employers up to that point. My challenge to myself for that hackathon was to see how I could build comparable tests in Applitools with as few lines as possible compared to my core Selenium tests.</p>
<p>Once I completed the solution, I ran an analysis on both projects to see where I stood. These comparisons do not account for the shared framework code for the Driver classes, enums to handle driver types and viewport sizes, page object models, and helper classes used between both solutions – just the test code itself. In the end, <strong>my core Selenium test project contained 845 lines of </strong><strong><em>just</em></strong><strong> test code</strong>.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"></figure>
</div>
<p>Conversely, to execute the same tests with the same, or greater, level of confidence in the solution, <strong>the number of lines written for the Applitools test code was only 174</strong>! </p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/oZdFcDvtmSPFb08SkSOLV-C9vYhnXsmIwTevNWUxmOAElRqxrzkZJbxFMbAcU_rG6bhUl-xNrL2I46SlGJnvn0yv1b6z03I741HQ1jv0TyQTxAIuvmGXH_Xxw2pKHi3JkfRrO6Y" alt="" width="953" height="155"/></figure>
</div>
<p>Though we SDETS do all we can to ensure that we have a robust test framework that is as resilient to change as possible, UI test code, by nature, is flaky. Having to maintain and refactor test code isn’t a possibility, it’s a <strong>promise</strong>. Keeping your test code lean = less time writing and maintaining test code = more time focusing on new application features and implementing other test solutions! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2 id="h-my-challenge-maximize-coverage-minimize-code">My Challenge – Maximize Coverage, Minimize Code</h2>
<p>When I saw the opportunity to join Applitools’ Holiday Shopping Hackathon, I jumped on it. This time, I wanted to challenge myself to create both my solution and test framework in not only as few lines as possible, but also as fast as I possibly could. </p>
<p>Traditionally, building out a test framework takes considerable time and effort. If you are working in Selenium, you can spend hours just building out a proper driver manager and populating your page object models. </p>
<p>Instead, I opted to go another route and use Cypress with my reasoning being two-pronged: 1) Cypress allows for fast ramp up of testing, where you can easily have your tests solution up and running against your application in as little as 5 minutes. <em>Seriously</em>. 2) Cypress is used as the test framework at my current place of employment, and it allowed me to build a functioning POC to showcase the power of Applitools to my colleagues. Win-win!</p>
<p>But there is a caveat…While Cypress allows for cross-browser automation against modern browsers, it does not support Safari or IE11. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f61e.png" alt="😞" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> For many companies with a large client base using one or both of these browsers, this can be a non-starter. But that’s where Applitools comes in.</p>
<p>While Cypress has a browser limitation, Applitools allowed me to leverage the easy, quick setup of test automation in Cypress without sacrificing the ability to run these tests on Safari and IE11. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Essentially, my test runs once with Cypress in a single browser, then Applitools re-renders the DOM from my test execution and runs the test against all browser combinations I specify. No browser limitations, no duplication of tests, in as few lines as possible.</p>
<p>How few? Let me share with you my simple solution that covered all necessary scenarios:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fZIbCkKaEYkZCpuWF94yIyXj-Fnl8BRtPAkZb6aw2RQucUhYSdr2daa6FlfaoClTvHvbnmSxdmmFcAnwmuRvZ9tODxmvcSRCJb6ipoKwF5cfESWte2eFqvfWU28LFA7oiMj3q8" alt=""/></figure>
<p>That’s it! A whopping 84 lines of very lean code that executes all test scenarios across all supported browsers and viewports. </p>
<h2 id="h-fast-from-concept-to-completion">Fast From Concept To Completion</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously, standing up an automated test solution can easily take hours to lay the groundwork before you write a single test. The best part of leveraging Cypress and Applitools is that it took roughly 1 hour from start to finish including the development of my tests, which is almost unheard of. </p>
<p>Beyond just the speed and ease of using Applitools, having such a powerful and succinct dashboard where you can collaboratively work with the entire development team on bugs is where they really shine. Using AI to intelligently identify discrepancies between a base image and the test run, capturing the DOM for easy debugging, controlling A/B testing for variants of your application, and integrating with CI/CD pipelines <em>and</em> Jira…I could go on. </p>
<p>All these capabilities provide great visibility into the health of a product, and allow product owners, managers, developers and QA engineers to work harmoniously together in management of test flows, bugs, and regressions from a single dashboard. In any organization adopting a shift-left mentality, you really can’t ask for much more. </p>
