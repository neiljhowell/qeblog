<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>Students everywhere are adjusting to new forms of education outside of the classroom. In conjunction with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/consumer-threat-notices/stay-secure-while-distance-learning/" rel="noopener noreferrer">distance learning</a>, it’s likely that many students will now be required to take online exams. To ensure that students don’t cheat on their online exams, educators are employing the help of online proctoring tools that help protect exam integrity. According to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/proctoru-data-breach" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom’s Guide</a>, a popular proctoring platform for online exams, named ProctorU, recently disclosed that it was the victim of a major data breach, resulting in the data of 444,000 people exposed online.</p>
<h2><strong>What You Should Know About This Breach</strong></h2>
<p>While it’s unclear how exactly the company was breached, ProctorU’s database is now offered for free in online hacker forums. The database contains private information of mostly college students, including their names, home addresses, emails, cell phone numbers, hashed passwords, and organization details. Specifically, it contained email addresses associated with a variety of institutions, including UCLA, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, North Virginia Community College, University of Texas, Columbia, UC Davis, Syracuse University, and more.</p>
<h2><strong>Don’t Get Schooled By Hackers</strong></h2>
<p>In their blog responding to the incident, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.proctoru.com/security-update" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProctorU stated</a> that they disabled the server, terminated access to the environment, and are currently investigating the incident. The company also implemented additional security measures to prevent similar events from recurring and notified universities and organizations affected by the breach.</p>
<p>However, students can take matters into their own hands as well. There are multiple proactive steps users can take to help minimize the damage caused by data breaches like this one. If you’re participating in distance education this school year, follow these security tips to help protect your data from hackers:</p>
<p><strong>Check to see if you were affected by the breach</strong></p>
<p>If you or someone you know has made a ProctorU account, <a target="_blank" href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">use this tool</a> – which shows users if they’ve been compromised by a security breach – to check if you could have been potentially affected.</p>
<p><strong>Change your credentials</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve been compromised by the ProctorU breach or another like it, err on the side of caution and change your passwords for all of your accounts. Taking extra precautions can help you avoid future attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Take password protection seriously</strong></p>
<p>When updating your credentials, you should always ensure that your password is strong and unique. Many users, including students, utilize the same password or variations of it across all their accounts. Therefore, be sure to diversify your passcodes to ensure hackers cannot obtain access to all your accounts at once, should one password be compromised. You can also employ a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">password manager</a> to keep track of your credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Enable two-factor or multi-factor authentication</strong></p>
<p>Two or multi-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security, as it requires multiple forms of verification. This reduces the risk of successful impersonation by hackers.</p>
<p><strong>Stay educated on security precautions</strong></p>
<p>As you adapt to learning from home, you’ll likely consider downloading various online tools to help make the transition easier. Before downloading the first tools you see, do your research and check for possible security vulnerabilities or known threats.</p>
<p><strong>Use a comprehensive security solution</strong></p>
<p>Enlist the help of a solution like <a target="_blank" href="https://home.mcafee.com/root/campaign.aspx?cid=235378" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee® Total Protection</a> to help safeguard your devices and data. With an extra layer of protection across your devices, you can continue learning online safely.</p>
<h2><strong>Stay Updated</strong></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>Joan Rivers once wrote, “I don’t want to order dinner by yelling into a plastic clown’s mouth”. We’ll get back to that shortly.</p>
<p>There is a compelling discussion to have about creating a dedicated team to “do all the automation”. Why not have all the automation developers or SDETs be on one team? After all, automation creation is a special skill like database administration and CI/CD/CT pipeline management, so shouldn’t we treat automators for testing in the same way? We can just hand them the requirements or acceptance criteria and they can bang out those automation scripts for us.</p>
<p>Some call the above situation the <em>automation drive-thru</em>; it’s an apt analogy. Like a fast-food drive-thru, you simply decide what you want to order, yell your order into a clown’s mouth, pay some fee, then get your food from the window. No muss, no fuss. Can’t automation development be similar?  Instead of a greasy burger, some chicken nuggets, or some delicious tacos, out comes an automated test script; again, no muss, no fuss, right? Sadly, it doesn’t always work out with no muss or fuss.</p>
<p>The drive-thru is but one way to organize teams for automation; there are, however, three ways: the dedicated automation team, the distributed automation team, and the hybrid approach.</p>
<p>Let’s explore!</p>
<h2 id="h.xpvxmlms6ppg"><strong>What Does A Dedicated Automation Team Look Like?</strong></h2>
<p>I know of an organization in a Fortune 500 company that had (and perhaps still has) a dedicated team that creates their automation for at least one organization. Putting snark aside, the dedicated automation team was the working, professional, effective version of the automation drive-thru. This team would take in requests to create automation scripts based on test cases and then create automated scripts that would (give or take) do what was prescribed based on the test cases. In general, I would dismiss this as folly; no sufficiently experienced testing professional could think this was a good working model. But, they did, and it was. This organization was producing quality automation with actual value. The organization was succeeding. I know this because I was well acquainted with their former leader and with several of their automation engineers.</p>
<h3 id="h.4tb3yqvyj1om"><strong>Dedicated Team Advantages</strong></h3>
<p>The main advantages of the dedicated team are the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/critical%20mass" rel="noopener noreferrer">critical mass</a> of automation expertise and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/economy%20of%20scale" rel="noopener noreferrer">economy of scale</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding <em>critical mass</em>, if you have all the automation expertise in one place, the automation endeavor has less friction when it comes to helping one another conquer automation challenges and deliver new automation capabilities. New automation engineers can be brought up to speed quickly because they have the rest of the automation team “at arm’s reach”. The walls between who automates what don’t need to exist (except when funding comes into play, but, to quote <a target="_blank" href="https://altonbrown.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alton Brown</a>, that’s another show).</p>
<p>Following from, and dependent on, critical mass is the ability to gain an economy of scale. The <em>Economy of scale</em>, for our purposes, is being more productive, efficient, effective, and therefore economical in the delivery of automation. Speaking practically, this means that there is a consistency that can be attained by having a dedicated automation team and that consistency can scale because of the critical mass and consistency. The dedicated team can be indoctrinated with the organization standards and the organization can preside over the guidelines; automation, regardless of framework or library, can be implemented based on a consistent ideology. When implemented judiciously, this approach can deliver economic gains to the organization and the company.</p>
<h3 id="h.dvwkrai2iojn"><strong>Dedicated Team Limitations</strong></h3>
<p>As is said, into every life some rain must fall. The main downside to a dedicated automation team is that the team, while experts in automation, likely lacks detailed domain knowledge. Of course, the automation team knows the basic operation of the system under test, but most current applications are large, distributed, multiple-serviced entities. It’s not realistic for a relatively small team of automation developers to be “sufficiently versed” in the esoterica of how each subsystem works; the details eventually get too small for this team to keep up. The limitation is further strained when the dedicated team is expected to provide automation across heterogeneous application environments. Having worked in an organization that was responsible for producing automation across disparate applications, I can attest that a lack of domain knowledge was a challenge to the value proposition.</p>
<h2 id="h.r7h2am996zom"><strong>What Does A Distributed Team Look Like?</strong></h2>
<p>Spinning 180 degrees from a dedicated automation team, we have the distributed automation team. Generally, a <em>distributed automation team</em> falls into one of three categories: in-team automation specialists, testers/QAs do the automation, developers do the automation.</p>
<p>In the case of <em>automation specialists</em>, often called software development engineers in test (SDETS) or quality engineers (QE), the name describes the role. The automation specialists only do that: automation. In the microcosm, we have that economy of scale and specialization, but it’s a relatively small economy in the scope of the overall company because it’s exclusive to the team on which the automation specialists work; this is especially true if the company has many, similar delivery teams. In this team implementation, the automation specialists are not testers/QAs; they work with the testers/QAs as well as the developers to develop the automation that helps the team be more effective or more efficient at testing.</p>
<p>It’s a great story to say that the <em>testers/QAs do the automation</em>. They automate instead of “doing it manually” and the team “goes faster”. To accomplish this approach, the testers/QAs need to have time to gain the skills necessary for automation; they also need the time to create and maintain the automation. Often, the <em>whole team does automation</em> variant can be more effective. In this model, the automation work, like other work, is not assigned to one role; anyone on the team with the appropriate skill set is empowered to perform or help with any task. Developers know how to program so they can be a natural fit to create automation or pair with a tester to create automation.</p>
<p>A third, and recently hot, approach is “we don’t need testers” because we can have the <em>developers do the automation</em>. This has a direct correlation to the testers/QAs do the automation approach, namely that automation is something you “just do” without training or special skills; since automation is programming and developers know how to program, it’s a natural fit for them. Like testers, however, developers need time to gain the appropriate skills to appropriately implement automation.</p>
<h3 id="h.6nbsm161v46e"><strong>Advantages</strong></h3>
<p>Since the automators, whoever they happen to be, can focus their implementations on the app or app area on which their team works, they can have deep domain knowledge of the software. This allows the automators, and therefore the automation, to be very specific and specialized in the automation they create. Since the automation software doesn’t have to be generalized across all application teams, there can be some cost savings in some cases; the automaton software, the frameworks and reusable libraries, in particular, don’t have to be all things to everyone so the automation can be created faster and likely at a lower cost.</p>
<p>Additionally, the deep domain knowledge enables the automators to discover hence unthought-of paths in the code that merit testing. This is difficult-to-impossible without the deep domain knowledge this approach permits.</p>
<p>Distributed automation teams are especially appropriate when the teams are working disparate products where there is little-to-no overlap between the application or system technologies.</p>
<h3 id="h.3ur7mf8q0tt1"><strong>Limitations</strong></h3>
<p>If <em>automation specialists</em> are creating the automation, these automators are often over-burdened or under-utilized. If there’s too much automation to create, not all of it gets created. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it can be sub-optimal if critical or high-value automation can’t be implemented simply because the team “doesn’t have time”. Conversely, if there’s “not enough” automation work to fully occupy the automators, they may be idle and the team loses potential value.</p>
<p>That’s OK, let’s “just” have the <em>testers/QAs do automation</em>. Bzzt, play again. There is an unfortunate perception that automation is something that you “just do”. I just brush my teeth, I just eat lunch, I just run some test cases, and I just create some automation. As much as it would be great if this were true, it’s just not. What typically happens is that the testers/QAs are “tasked” with automation with little-to-no guidance or training and this effort is heaped on top of their existing work, which continues to grow; when was the last time a team released a new version of their software with fewer features? Unless the organization is tolerant of a “let’s slow down now to go faster later” strategy, this approach is fraught with peril and the likely outcome will be “automation can’t work here”.</p>
<p><em>Developers do the automation</em> has a similar issue. Leadership wants this to happen with negligible impact to effort estimates even in the short term. For teams that can’t embrace the “let’s slow down now to go faster later” strategy, one of two outcomes is usually the result. One outcome is that the created automation is largely confirmatory; the automation shows that the software can work under very specific conditions and other conditions are not accounted for; the developers are often required to perform heroic efforts to accomplish even this due to needing to attain an on-time delivery. The other outcome is that automation takes “too long” so it doesn’t work here, and the automation endeavor is abandoned.</p>
<p>If the automation creation is truly distributed, it is difficult or impossible for the teams to leverage each other’s work. Even the most well-meaning teams that try to develop cooperatively will have trouble doing so in a consistent manner. The incentive for the individual teams is to achieve the goals set for those teams. This work is not purposely completed to the detriment of the other team, but there is usually little-to-no incentive for teams to cooperate at that level. Senior leadership is usually not thrilled to pin their organization’s success on the “goodwill” of another team; similarly, those same leaders are not likely to jeopardize their organization’s success by spending some of their team’s cycles to help another team’s automation implementation if the need comes at a critical time.</p>
<p>If code sharing is still desired, some of the hard dependencies can be mitigated by having a shared codebase, something like an “internal open source” repository. The primary challenge there is when conflicting changes are made to the shared code. How is that conflict resolved? Often, even in the best-intentioned companies, organizational incentives and directives reign so the teams agree to fork the shared automation repository with the well-intended agreement to merge after the next business milestone. Sadly, that seldom happens; there’s always another business milestone.</p>
<h2 id="h.n0ijeftvftn7"><strong>The Hybrid Approach – An Oft-Appropriate Middle Ground</strong></h2>
<p>So, let’s split the difference, shall we?</p>
<p>As noted above, there are advantages and disadvantages to each of the preceding approaches. What if we meld the two? Let’s take the strengths of each team layout and attempt to mitigate the disadvantages. The goal is to let each of the disciplines focus on its strengths.</p>
<p>In this approach, the automation development is divided into two competencies: the base team and the distributed teams.</p>
<h3 id="h.7t0zz298japi"><strong>The Base Team</strong></h3>
<p>The base team is responsible for all the shared infrastructure. Need a wrapper around Selenium’s WebElement? The base team handles that. Need an encapsulation around Microsoft’s API library? The base team handles that, too. Need some helper functions to reduce the effort required to create or maintain automation? That’s right, the base team handles that.</p>
<p>The base team comprises experienced automation developers who are in the best position to provide a general framework, platform, and infrastructure for automation creation. The base team is also tasked with the training, coaching, and guidance of the teams implementing the actual automation.</p>
<p>It’s also responsible for coaching on the appropriate practices for the company. This team is trained in automation strategy, implementation, and theory. They provide the base infrastructure implementation and many, if not all, of the shared components used across the distributed teams but they understand and can coach on the theory behind the strategy and implementation.</p>
<h3 id="h.ybgh72o25dkm"><strong>The Distributed Teams</strong></h3>
<p>The distributed teams consume and exploit the value provided by the base team. They are domain experts who have intimate knowledge of the software being tested and of how to use the shared automation created by the base team. This is the team that writes the automation that helps the testers.</p>
<h3 id="h.u4kftvqyn41a"><strong>Risks</strong></h3>
<p>This is not a panacea.</p>
<p>If the base team isn’t staffed with enough appropriate people to service all of the distributed teams, the base team will become a bottleneck, actually impeding progress instead of facilitating it. If getting enough appropriate base team staff members is a challenge, the previously mentioned internal open-source model can be valuable. This model has a higher chance of success with a base team than with a purely distributed model because the base team is the steward of the shared code. Care must be taken, however, to avoid the next risk.</p>
<p>A dedicated base team runs the risk of becoming or at least being viewed as an <em><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_tower" rel="noopener noreferrer">ivory tower</a></em>, i.e., delivering intellectual solutions and directives as opposed to practical and workable ones. One way to mitigate this risk is to give the base team a directive to be collaborative as opposed to dictatorial, conversations as opposed to edicts. Another way is to include members of the distributed team as stakeholders, which they indeed are, in any prioritization and feature creation discussions.</p>
<p>Sadly, as in many other corporate aspects, politics often play a role when organizing a base team. The base team is seen as strategic: whoever controls the base team owns their own automation destiny. When one application team or organization controls the base team, the non-controlling teams and organizations are at a disadvantage when conflicts arise or when the controlling team must make difficult business decisions. One way to mitigate this situation is to organize the base team in a “shared services” organization, such as the organization that houses IT and security.</p>
<h2 id="h.hjr12jrszzq7"><strong>Recommendations?</strong></h2>
<p>There’s not really a wrong way to organize an automation team. The key is to be appropriate; let the context of what the company and organizations need and will tolerate. The hybrid team can be very powerful and has most of the advantages of both the dedicated team and the distributed team approaches. That said, the hybrid approach is not appropriate for every company or organization. There is a large amount of trust and some organizational overhead with this approach; there’s also a funding facet. Choose an appropriate approach then be prepared to evolve if the initial choice becomes inappropriate.</p>

<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>Retired Marine fighter pilot and Top Gun instructor Dave Berke said “Every single thing you do in your life, every decision you make, is an OODA Loop.” OODA Loop? Observe–Orient–Decide–Act, the “OODA Loop” was originally developed by United States Air Force Colonel John Boyd and outlines that fundamentally all actions are first based on observations.  If you can’t first observe you are at a serious disadvantage. This can be applied at every scale from planning a large-scale military invasion, to changing lanes on a highway or even down to the split-second decision of picking up a glass of water off a table. But it all starts with observation.</p>
<p>If observation or information about what’s around us is so important, then it’s no surprise that tools and devices that can provide us information not only increase our success but also make us feel more comfortable. The personal robot called temi, is such a device. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3809114,00.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">With 1,000 new devices being created a month</a>, temi can help us see a loved one in the hospital through teleconferencing, escort us to the ballroom in the hotel we are staying at or help a doctor virtually visit with a patient. In fact, across Israel, temi was recently selected as the de facto robotics platform for hospital telepresence. Temi can allow us to observe and interact remotely; all while influencing what we decide to do next with the information we have learned.</p>
<p>But what are the risks associated with tools that help provide greater information into our OODA Loop? How could someone with malicious intent use tools like temi to improve their OODA Loop, furthering their ability to cause harm? Could someone control temi without the owner’s permission? What if someone could turn on the camera and microphone and see the robot’s surroundings while listening to your medical diagnosis or treatment plan? What if someone could “check in on your kids” and map out your house without your permission? These are the type of questions that McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) aims to answer when we see a product like temi. We look at technologies and the wealth of information they provide through the lens of an attacker; with the goal of making your experience a safer one. So, it is no surprise that our team decided to take a deeper look into temi when it was first released.</p>
<p>On day one, like a kid during Christmas, we unboxed our shiny new temi with a sense of joy and excitement. Like your average user, we set it up following the included directions, had it follow us around dressed up as a ghost for Halloween, marked key locations, made video calls and were amazed at just how cool this robot was! Maybe a little less like your average user, we also captured all the network traffic while temi showed off and did a firmware update. We also looked at what open network ports temi exposed, decompiled the Android application, activated android debugger (adb) and installed a ssh server, just to be safe.  Basically, we treated temi like your child’s first date in high school – we did a background check and used proper intimidation techniques before we allowed temi to go on a date.</p>
<p>Over the next several months, we really dug into what we learned from our “first date” with temi. What we discovered, not unlike some of my first high school dates, is temi had some trust issues. This is not a good report card considering some of temi’s primary functions. For the ability to make video calls and to remotely control temi securely, it’s important to keep information used to connect to a call secret and secured. Since temi had some flaws doing so, the team turned its attention to the question of whether these “character flaws” could be exploited.</p>
<p>It turned out with only a few modifications to the original temi Android application, we could intercept phone calls intended for another user. With a few more modifications, temi began to trust us (the attacker) to navigate it around and activate the camera and microphone. Additionally, we discovered the only knowledge an attacker would need to know about the victim is their phone number. Yes, the same number you can’t figure out how tele-markers got ahold of was the information a malicious actor would need to access your temi completely remotely without your knowledge or consent.</p>
<p>For an attacker, temi’s security flaws allows them to feed vital information into their OODA Loop. Consider a hospital that keeps a very tight and well-run information security program. From the outside they are almost impossible to steal information from. The vulnerabilities discovered in temi now provide them a way to gather information about the internal operations of the business without needing to crack the well implemented business network or physical security. With the phone number of anyone who has called a temi recently, an attacker could observe what room number and condition a hospitalized member of congress is in. Temi could watch the security guard type in the building alarm code. Temi could observe the dog pictures on the nurse’s desk labeled with its cute name and birthday, that just happens to also be part of their password. This information can be invaluable to an attacker’s OODA loop and the potentially malicious decisions they make. Temi was a challenging target to compromise, but the nature of the flaws discovered highlight the importance of this research and the value of vendors to provide fast and effective mitigations, as was the case here.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy punishing themselves with an excessive amount of technical detail of these vulnerabilities, we have a special treat for you in our highly technical paper on this research <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/call-an-exorcist-my-robots-possessed/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. This dives into the vulnerability discovery and exploitation process from start to finish in intricate detail.</p>
<p>In keeping with our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/threat-center/advanced-threat-research/disclosure.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">responsible disclosure program</a>, we reached out to temi as soon as we confirmed that the vulnerabilities we discovered were exploitable. Temi was very receptive, grateful, and had a strong desire to improve the security of temi. Over the next several weeks, we worked closely with their team to develop a more robust solution for temi. For each vulnerability, we provided temi with two mitigations strategies; a band aid and a cure. It is common for vendors to only implement the band aid or quick fix solution. To their credit, temi took on the challenge of implementing the more effective solution or the cure for all findings. Once in place, we were able to test and confirm that all the vulnerabilities reported were effectively mitigated. It is always exciting to see the positive impact security research can have when responsible disclosure is valued by vendor and researchers alike. The following demo video is a light-hearted way to show the true possible impact of the remote accessibility component of this research, had these been found by adversaries instead of responsibly disclosed by McAfee ATR and fixed by temi.</p>
<p><div class="fitvids-video"><iframe title="McAfee ATR illustrates the impact of temi vulnerabilities" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7aYURVzcL2c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</p>
<p>So, what is the larger lesson here? I would venture to guess that I wouldn’t be the first to conclude that Colonel John Boyd was a smart man and his theory of the OODA Loop is not only effective but also strengthens a process – in this case, vulnerability mitigation. For our research, this applies directly to a personal robot assistant which is currently being used worldwide, across a wide range of industries, and currently producing nearly 1,000 new units a month. McAfee’s ATR team <em>observed</em> a new impactful technology emerging into the market. Due to our previous experiences and technical expertise we were well <em>oriented</em> in a position where we <em>decided</em> to take further <em>action </em>and investigate. Temi <em>observed</em> the value in collaboration, <em>oriented</em> themselves in a position where they could <em>decide</em> to take <em>action</em> in making a tool used for <em>observation</em> a more secure product.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.neotys.com/neoload/whats-new" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NeoLoad 7.5</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unveils new Workspace feature set and enhanced integrations with Dynatrace and Tricentis Tosca. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NeoLoad’s collaboration and integration capabilities are now even more powerful. NeoLoad introduces a new way for teams to collaborate and organize their performance testing: Workspaces. Integration with Dynatrace is now native in NeoLoad, one click to access bi-directional data in either UI and speed up analysis.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><b>What’s New in This Release?</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Workspaces</strong> Workspaces enable administrators to assign users into teams who can then separate assets such as tests, test results and webhooks in one or multiple Workspaces. Workspaces allow teams to better collaborate on performance testing and organize their work. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Dynatrace Integration</strong> NeoLoad’s integration with Dynatrace is now native to NeoLoad. The two products share test result data which is viewable from either the NeoLoad or the Dynatrace user interface. Having the data in one view speeds test analysis and root cause analysis. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tosca Integration</strong> NeoLoad’s integration with Tosca now includes support to convert Tosca API functional tests into NeoLoad performance tests. NeoLoad previously released support for the conversion of Tosca web, GUI and SAP functional tests to NeoLoad performance tests. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feature enhancements – feature enhancements are also included in this release.   </span></li>

					<description><![CDATA[Behavior-driven development (BDD) is an agile development process that encourages teams to share tools and a process to collaborate on]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>Behavior-driven development (BDD) is an agile development process that encourages teams to share tools and a process to collaborate on software development projects across developers, QA folks, and business stakeholders. Sounds good, right? I mean, who wouldn’t want to be more collaborative and transparent with all project stakeholders? I believe there is tremendous value in this type of approach. </p>
<p>However, people choose to use BDD tools for many different reasons—and in my experience, they’re often the wrong reasons. In certain cases, BDD tools are likely to do more harm than good. Can you be successful with BDD tools? Yes. But often, how it <i>should </i>work doesn’t reflect how it usually <i>does </i>work.</p>
<p>The overall theme of my talks is to figure out ways to make your testing initiatives more difficult to fail. It is important to keep things simple with fewer moving parts and more and useful abstractions. BDD tools generally fail when it comes to making things easier to maintain.</p>
<p>I recently hosted a STP webinar called “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.softwaretestpro.com/the-hidden-costs-of-bdd-tools/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hidden Costs of BDD Tools</a>.” I shared my views on how the allure of using Cucumber or other “Given/When/Then” code wrappers seems greater than ever, but that there is a fairly narrow path to success. In the webinar, I talked about the various reasons why people choose to use BDD tools as well as what the reality looks like for many companies. I also revealed some of the inherent underlying issues with BDD tooling, including why teams so often end up in trouble when using them, and discussed some alternatives for how to get the most out of your UI testing. If you’re interested in BDD, it’s worth your time to watch the webinar. </p>
<p>As you can imagine, BDD can be a hot topic! We got many questions and were only able to get to a few of them during the live event, so I decided to take some of the other questions and answer them right here in this handy blog post. You can also check out some of the conversations with these questions on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TitusOnBDD" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>. </p>
<p><b>What is your suggestion for how to best get started using the BDD approach? </b></p>
<p>If you don’t know how or why to use a BDD tool: don’t use it. If you want to practice BDD, first you need to make sure your manager, product team and developers are all on board. </p>
<p><b>Have you found any good tools/frameworks that provide documentation outside of relying on the &#8220;Clean Code&#8221; (code is readable) perspective?</b></p>
<p>That really depends on what you are trying to document. I’d love to have “Backward BDD” tooling that generates the information people are interested in from the code, rather than having the user do it from the other direction. </p>
<p><b>Any suggestions on how to &#8220;undo&#8221; a BDD setup?</b></p>
<p>First, copy/paste the actual code into methods. Next, abstract out anything imperative into Page and Data Objects. </p>
<p><b>The BDD tool worked great because there was no deep expertise on coding and I think Cucumber provides a layer (non-business) that allows them to be more effective. </b></p>
<p>The only problem is that these tools don’t avoid the need to write good code. That still has to happen. If your goal is to give less technical people busywork, sure; but this will not  improve your test strategy.</p>
<p><b>What would be a non-BDD alternative to a Screenplay pattern promoted by Serenity BDD? </b></p>
<p>I’ve never seen an example, but would be interested in seeing one. Also, I prefer Atomic/Autonomous/Short DOM to Database tests which PO pattern supports and Screenplay does not.</p>
<p><b>I also have seen all sorts of wrong usage of BDD, but TBH&#8230; I&#8217;ve also seen that elsewhere.</b></p>
<p>Definitely important to keep in mind that browser automation is hard! Selenium provides some specific challenges that require domain knowledge and technical prowess to address. </p>
<p><b>What&#8217;s the difference between Cucumber and Gauge?</b></p>
<p>The difference is I haven’t used Gauge before. My BDD tooling talk applies to any software that does some form of translating English language to code.</p>
<p><b>What is your preferred alternative to the flexibility of Cucumber&#8217;s tags for running various subsets of tests? What&#8217;s your preferred alternative for the functionality Cucumber&#8217;s profiles provide?</b></p>
<p>This functionality will vary based on Test Runner. RSpec definitely supports these things in Ruby; I would be surprised if most test runners in other languages did not have similar functionality. </p>
<p><b>Can you give an example of when you&#8217;ve seen BDD tools used successfully where they  provide real value?</b></p>
<p>Depends on what you mean by “success” and “real value.” I mentioned the scenario of a consultant providing “agile transformation” within a company/team being useful, but that’s a specific (and temporary) context.</p>
<p><b>What is your thought for data testing in capturing these requirements?</b></p>
<p>Data Driven Testing doesn’t belong in a DOM to Database test. Make sure the form works, then any investigation into what the data entry does in your system should be at a lower level.</p>
<p><b>What tool do you recommend for data testing to capture requirements?</b></p>
<p>A REST client in the language of your choice.</p>
<p><b>How do you feel about [the Geb/Spock] implementation of BDD over Cucumber  (i.e. where the feature file is not separate, but is the outline for the test case implementation)?</b></p>
<p>I’m definitely a fan of distinguishing between Arrange, Act and Assert statements; so long as it isn’t doing natural language translation it sounds great.</p>
<p><b>Is it possible to develop a tool that is more like a wizard that guides you through the process?</b></p>
<p>There are codeless solutions out there, but most of what I’ve seen only handles the easier use cases and generates its own maintenance costs. One of them might be “good enough” for what you need.</p>
<p><b> For a tester who is trying to bridge the manual to automation gap&#8230;where to start? Many job listings mention Cucumber-Gherkin.</b></p>
<p>Manual testers who only know how to write Gherkin statements won’t have great job security, in my opinion. There really isn’t a way to escape the need for writing good code, so your best bet is to find resources to become a good developer in the first place.</p>
<p>###</p>
