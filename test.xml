					<description><![CDATA[As attackers become more sophisticated, your organization needs increased visibility into what&#8217;s happening on its computer networks. Advanced attacks can be carried]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p>
<div>
<p>As attackers become more sophisticated, your organization needs increased visibility into what&#8217;s happening on its computer networks. Advanced attacks can be carried out over months or even years, so security teams need to act quickly when a foe eventually does tip his hand.</p>
<p>One way to do that is to deploy the powerful combination of user and entity behavioral analytics with endpoint monitoring, detection, and response. Through a combination of machine learning, artificial intelligence, big data, and analytics, <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/identity-governance-admin-tb/behavioral-analytics-security?lx=3C7k5c&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">behavioral analytics can identify malicious activity</a> and blunt or stop cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Fernando Montenegro, principal analyst for information security with 451 Research, said the data is used to identify changes in behavior that are suspicious enough to be flagged for follow up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about defining a user baseline, which is difficult. It&#8217;s not an exact science.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/fsmontenegro" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Fernando Montenegro</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s how your organization can use behavioral analytics to tackle advanced threats.</p>
<p><em>[ Join this May 28 Webinar to learn <a target="_blank" href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/7477/400829?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">how to mitigate threats with agility during the pandemic</a>. Plus: See TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide to a <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/cloud-based-security-analytics-ops-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modern Security Operations Center</a> ]</em></p>
<h3>Behavioral analysis&#8217; key indicator</h3>
<p>A cornerstone of behavioral analysis is that all malicious attacks have one thing in common: They all exhibit behavior that&#8217;s different from normal behavior on a network or system. By targeting this abnormal behavior, security teams can detect malicious attacks before they can get fully off the ground.</p>
<p>If you see someone in finance running reconnaissance-type command-line arguments such as &#8220;whoami&#8221; or &#8220;ipconfig,&#8221; you pay attention. While the same activities from someone in engineering may not be as suspicious, said Greg Foss, a senior threat researcher with VMware Carbon Black, these should be investigated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;This should rightfully raise some alarms. Paying attention to small details that are specific to your infrastructure can be a game-changer.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/Heinzarelli" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Greg Foss</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a similar vein, endpoint detection and response technology monitors an organization&#8217;s endpoints and proactively hunts for threats with advanced algorithms and behavioral analysis.</p>
<h3>Needed: A rich source of data</h3>
<p>Among all the sources of data scrutinized by user and entity behavioral analytics (UEBA), endpoint data is the richest, said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/eeksock" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stephan Jou</a>, CTO of Interset, a security analytics company owned by Micro Focus.</p>
<p>There are scenarios, such as privilege escalation, that are difficult to detect without endpoint monitoring, he said. With rich endpoint data ingested to run behavioral analytics, UEBA &#8220;gains more context around individual user and entity behaviors, thus shedding light on various threat indicators.&#8221;</p>
<p>This new user information—abnormal login frequency, date or time of work, and people using unusual machines—&#8221;adds valuable context to help identify threats that might otherwise go unseen,&#8221; he said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;With the right user context, credential abuse, adversary surveillance, lateral movement, data exfiltration, and more can be detected efficiently and effectively.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/eeksock" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stephan Jou</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Monitoring tools also expose what&#8217;s happening on the endpoints themselves. They can reveal facts about creating new files, launching processes, and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/identity-governance-admin-tb/identity-governance-best-practices?lx=3C7k5c&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">accessing the registry</a>, &#8220;which can all be signs of malicious activity,&#8221; said Ekaterina Kilyusheva, head of information security analytics at Positive Technologies. </p>
<p>However, endpoint monitoring alone <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/identity-governance-admin-tb/identity-management-?lx=3C7k5c&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">can&#8217;t give security teams the kind of visibility they need to nip threats in the bud</a>. The raw data it produces just increases the size of the haystack in which adversaries can hide, said Amol Kulkarni, chief product officer at the security company CrowdStrike. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It needs to be coupled with behavioral analytics, to contextualize the telemetry and create actionable alerts by correlating diverse event streams across the environment.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/amol_s_kulkarni" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amol Kulkarni</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>[ Get up to speed on zero trust with <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/zero-trust-identity-access-management-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide: Zero Trust with Identity and Access Management. </a>Plus: Join this June 2 Webinar to learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/zero-trust-identity-access-management-tb/conquering-the-authe?lx=9nmHuO&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to conquer zero trust authentication challenges</a> ]</em></p>
<h3>Gaining critical visibility</h3>
<p>Nevertheless, endpoint monitoring remains important to understanding the threat landscape facing an organization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It allows security professionals to gain more visibility over important entry points which may be vulnerable to threat actors.&#8221;<br />—Stephan Jou</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This critical visibility over all network devices helps prevent hackers from exploiting gaps within your security architecture, he said. It also helps security professionals gain a better understanding of where they can improve their security posture—before damage is done.</p>
<p>But visibility isn&#8217;t enough. You need to have real-time visibility to get ahead of attacker behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If only a snapshot of a potential cyber incident is presented to security teams, they lose the ability to get a comprehensive view into the attack cycle, which hinders better cyber hygiene and preparedness.&#8221;<br />—Amol Kulkarni</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Endpoint monitoring is necessary to obtain information about activity at the end nodes of the system that cannot be detected by auditing the network infrastructure. But to get a complete picture of the threat landscape, data about the end nodes alone is not enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;You also need to use network traffic analysis tools that complement the picture of <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/resources/techbeacon-guide-it-operations-monitoring" rel="noopener noreferrer">what is happening in the infrastructure</a> and allow you to see those events that go beyond the scope of the monitoring tools on the end nodes.&#8221;<br />—Ekaterina Kilyusheva</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Make analytics a team player</h3>
<p>As powerful as behavioral analysis can be in thwarting sophisticated attacks, it&#8217;s most powerful when teamed with other security systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Behavioral analytics will not replace existing security systems.&#8221;<br />—Greg Foss</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, it augments existing security infrastructure by providing context that can be leveraged for investigations and response.</p>
<p>Behavioral analytics and endpoint monitoring are made more powerful when combined with tools such as SIEM (security information and event management) and SOAR (security orchestration, automation, and response), Jou said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In today’s world, it’s extremely hard to rip and replace an existing security system, so intelligent UEBA and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/4-key-challenges-next-gen-security-operations-centers" rel="noopener noreferrer">endpoint detection and response tools</a> need to be able to simply integrate into an organization with things like cloud deployments and a seamless user experience.&#8221;<br />—Stephan Jou</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, advanced analytics is an incredible augmentation to correlation, and a powerful tool for threat hunters, Jou said. &#8220;As this realization becomes more pervasive, solutions will become more tightly integrated and converged.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p>
<div>
<p>One major roadblock that prevents teams from successfully maturing their performance efforts is a lack of training. Sometimes, just knowing where to start can be a challenge.</p>
<p>Before getting into specific training resources, however, it might be helpful to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-engineering-critical?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">define performance engineering</a> and describe how <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-testing-to-engineering?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">it differs from performance testing</a>.</p>
<p>In their book <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-performance-engineering/9781492030164/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><i>Effective Performance Engineering</i></a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/appperfeng" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Todd DeCapua</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/neoevans/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shane Evans</a> describe performance engineering as a cultural shift in the way organizations view their essential processes. Performance engineering embraces practices and capabilities that build quality and performance throughout an organization.</p>
<p>It helps your organization increase revenue, customer attraction and retention, brand value, and competitive advantage—all while meeting or exceeding the expectations of your end users.</p>
<p>For its part, performance engineering means understanding how all the parts of the system fit together, knowing which metrics matter, and building in performance from the first design.</p>
<p>This list of tools and resources is a good place to begin. It can help transform your organizations into <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-engineering-techniques?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">performance engineering centers of excellence</a>.</p>
<p><em>[ Get up to speed on <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/performance-engineering-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">Performance Engineering with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide</a>.

<h3>Maturity levels and how they relate to performance engineering</h3>
<p>DeCapua describes these five main stages of maturity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: Randomly breaking things</li>
<li>Level 2: Performance testing</li>
<li>Level 3: Performance analytics</li>
<li>Level 4: Lifecycle virtualization</li>
<li>Level 5: &#8220;Performance&#8221; engineering</li>
</ul>
<p>Performance engineering is the top layer, Level 5, which all organizations should strive to reach.</p>
<p>Once you understand what performance engineering is, you still need to convince management, and getting everyone on board with a performance engineering transformation can be a challenge.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://wpostats.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">web performance optimization (WPO) stats compiled here</a> can help. Case studies and experiments demonstrate WPO&#8217;s impact on user experience and business metrics. If you&#8217;re trying to convince your organization that performance testing is important to your software development efforts, this is a great place to start. Keep in mind that WPO is just one small piece of performance engineering.</p>
<h3>One-user and front-end performance</h3>
<p>As companies begin to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/which-performance-tests-are-realistic-shift-left" rel="noopener noreferrer">shift left in their performance activities</a>, one-user performance is one area that is often overlooked.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/perfpulley" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">James Pulley</a>, an independent consultant working with PerfBytes, said in a recent <a target="_blank" href="https://testguild.com/podcasts/performance" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TestGuild performance podcast</a> that most engineers focus on how their applications perform for many concurrent users.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s equally important, though, to know whether an app also scales for one. Client-side, one-user performance is important because testing has moved to the front end, with a focus on <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-it-ops-can-boost-your-user-experience" rel="noopener noreferrer">user experience (UX) performance</a>.</p>
<p>Modern applications spend more time in the browser than on the server side, with many apps using JavaScript frameworks such as <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">React</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://angular.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Angular </a>front ends.</p>
<p>These feature-rich front ends add a new layer that needs to be measured. So the measurement of the rendering time of an application that is under test on a client&#8217;s local machine becomes critical.</p>
<p>This also leads to applications becoming more complex, with heavier front ends that use up more resources. Because of this, there&#8217;s a need to also include performance testing from the user&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/guyarieli" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Guy Arieli</a>, CEO of Experitest, believes that <a target="_blank" href="http://testguild.com/podcast/performance/p29-guy/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">mobile UX performance is even more significant</a> than the apps&#8217; performance. When you work with your browser on your desktop, you are connected via Wi-Fi. And the bandwidth that you&#8217;re using will be relatively high compared to anything you will find in 3G or even 4G, especially with changing network conditions and where the reception is not very good.</p>
<p>A pillar of performance engineering is that performance needs to be baked into your software from the beginning, with developers creating performant code in your product from the start.</p>
<p>Here are some resources to help you test all of the above.</p>

<h3>Tools to capture front-end performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.webpagetest.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Webpagetest</a> is the standard for measuring performance from users&#8217; perspectives and for capturing visual metrics. It is a free service that provides a website speed test; it allows you to run your test from multiple locations using real browsers at real consumer connection speeds. You can also create your own instance of a web page test and run it behind the firewall to verify your intranet pages or pages that are under development. Webpagetest give you test location options that include testing from an Android or iOS device as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wix/DetoxInstruments" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Detox Instruments</a> is a performance analysis and testing framework designed to help developers profile their mobile apps to better understand and optimize their behavior and performance. It can help your developers find issues early in the development cycle for mobile apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristian-marquez/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cristian Daniel Marquez Barrios</a>, a front-end developer with over 10 years of experience, suggests that <a target="_blank" href="http://testguild.com/podcast/performance/p23-cristian/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">your front-end developers should be using, at a minimum, Google Lighthouse metrics</a>. These are available in Google Chrome tools. When you open <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">DevTools in Chrome</a> and navigate to the Audits tab, you can find the Lighthouse audit. This will measure the performance of your site, simulating mobile on a desktop version of a browser, so it&#8217;s a really good tool to start with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sitespeed.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sitespeed.io</a> is a set of open-source tools that make it easy to measure the performance of your website. It includes not only the software that can run performance tests, but also Grafana (see below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://grafana.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Grafana</a> collects and presents results from several test rounds, which means you can monitor the performance of your site. The tool also allows you to take a lot of additional actions, such as verifying the performance of all the pages of your site, or selected pages. You can also simulate different network connections, and much more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other tools Sitespeed.io gives you include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/coach/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Coach</a>, which can help make your web page faster. Coach acts like a modern version of YSlow, and gives you advice for how your page could be faster.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/browsertime/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Browsertime</a>; this lets you automate running JavaScript in your browser to collect performance-timing metrics of your website.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/compare/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Compare</a>, which matches two HAR files and finds regressions.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/pagexray/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">PageXray</a>; this converts a HAR file to a JSON format that is easier to read.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/throttle/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Throttle</a>, which simulates slow network connections on Linux and macOS X and helps you see how the application performs when bandwidth is limited.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/chrome-har/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Chrome-HAR</a>, which creates Chrome HAR files based on events from the Chrome Debugging Protocol.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other client-side performance resources</h3>
<p>If your application is very heavy on JavaScript client-side functionality, you&#8217;re going to want to measure that as well. Here are some other tools to analyze web pages, monitor performance, and find front-end code quality issues.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://yslow.org" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">YSlow</a> analyzes web pages and determines why they&#8217;re slow, based on Yahoo&#8217;s rules for high-performance websites.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Performance testing example sites</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re just getting started or don&#8217;t have an app to run performance tests against, it&#8217;s useful to have an example app to test against to help you as you learn. Here are a few web pages designed solely for this purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re an old-time Mercury automation engineer, you&#8217;ll probably remember the sample site called <a target="_blank" href="http://newtours.demoaut.com/mercurywelcome.php" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mercury Tours</a> that shipped with WinRunner, QTP, and UFT. You can also use it as an example performance testing site.</li>
<li>Another old-time favorite website for performance testing is a full web application called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kazuki43zoo/mybatis-spring-boot-jpetstore" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">JpetStore</a>; it&#8217;s built on top of MyBatis 3, Spring 5, and Stripes.</li>
<li>Blazemeter also has a popular test site; it&#8217;s called <a target="_blank" href="http://blazedemo.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">BlazeDemo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resources for performance testing newbies</h3>
<p>In addition to <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-performance-engineering/9781492030164/?intcmp=il-webops-free-product-na_new_site_what_is_effective_performance_engineering_text_cta" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Effective Performance Engineering</a>,</em> the book already mentioned above, here are a few other resources:</p>

Knowing this data can help you create more realistic tests for how your application will be used in production.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Test infrastructure performance resources</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/paulsbruce" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Paul Bruce</a>, DevOps advocate and automation and performance engineer at Neotys, says that in his experience, the traditional folks managing performance are missing the huge dangers and opportunities of the Kubernetes world.</p>
<p>Here are some Kubernetes performance testing resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kubernetes/perf-tests" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes perf-tests</a> is a repository dedicated to storing various Kubernetes-related performance test-related tools. If you want to add your own load test, benchmark, framework, or other tool, contact one of the owners.</li>

</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s not forget Docker. Here are some Docker images that have performance testing tools baked into them from the beginning:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/r/vmarrazzo/jmeter/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">JMeter Docker</a> is a lightweight Docker image for Apache JMeter.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Performance+Plugin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jenkins Performance Plugin</a> allows you to capture reports from popular testing tools. Jenkins will generate graphics with a trend report of performance and robustness. It allows you to set the final build status as good, unstable, or failed, based on the reported error percentage.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://keptn.sh/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Keptn</a> is a control-plane for DevOps automation of cloud-native applications. Keptn uses a declarative approach to build automation for delivery and operations, which can be scaled to a large number of services.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Site reliability</h3>
<p>Because I&#8217;m old school, I still call many software development activities &#8220;performance testing,&#8221; but I’ve begun to see a trend that has this term falling by the wayside.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/perfsherpa" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mark Tomlinson</a>, the &#8220;performance sherpa,&#8221; has an interesting theory. He says that if you listen to developers speak, they tend to use the term &#8220;webperf&#8221; rather than &#8220;performance testing.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s very clear that developers and engineers are doing performance work. Web designers are doing performance work. Infrastructure teams are doing performance work. And none of them self-identify as &#8220;testers&#8221; in their organizations.</p>
<p>So, if you’re like me and still call it performance testing, don’t ignore resources that also exist for <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/sre-practice-5-insights-googles-experience" rel="noopener noreferrer">site reliability engineers</a> or infrastructure teams. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a target="_blank" href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/toc/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Site Reliability Engineering Book</a>: </em>In this free e-book,<i> </i>members of Google&#8217;s SRE team explain how their engagement with the entire software lifecycle has helped Google build, deploy, monitor, and maintain some of the largest software systems in the world.</li>
<li><em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/chaos-engineering/9781491988459/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Chaos Engineering</a>: </em>In this report, members of the Netflix team that developed chaos engineering explain how to apply these principles to your own system. By introducing controlled experiments, you&#8217;ll learn how behavior from component interactions can cause your system to drift into an unsafe, chaotic state.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Chaos Monkey</a> randomly terminates virtual machine instances and containers that run inside your production environment. Exposing engineers to failures more frequently gives them incentives to build resilient services.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve tried using Chaos Monkey in the past, you may have found it difficult to use and understand. There’s another product built on top of it called Gremlin that makes it easier to get started.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gremlin.com/product/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gremlin Free</a> provides the ability to run both Shutdown and CPU attacks on your hosts or containers, controlled by a simple user interface at no cost.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>Several weeks ago, we sat down with Thai Pangsakulyanont, who was one of the Applitools Visual AI Rockstar Hackathon winners, about his experiences in the Hackathon and what he took away from the experience.</p>
<p>Thai Pangsakulyanont is a front-end architect working for <a target="_blank" href="https://taskworld.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taskworld</a> in Bangkok, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thailand</a>. He has eight years of testing experience, including six with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h.bpkvgnq732wu">Starting Point</h2>
<p>At Taskworld, Thai said, they make and sell a productivity/project management web application.</p>
<p>The stack is mostly JavaScript.  For their end-to-end testing, they use their own test runner, called Prescript. They use prescript in conjunction with Selenium and “expect” assertions.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>
<p>Thai said he has six years of experience with Selenium, using both Javascript and Ruby. He had no prior experience with Applitools, but he did have prior experience with other image diffing programs.  For instance, he was using Javascript image processing for comparing images as an experiment and part of his side project.</p>
<h2 id="h.dgg4idiz3yla">Applitools Pre-Hackathon Expectations and Experience</h2>
<p>Having used percy.io previously Thai expected something like a visual diff tool. He knows he can use percy for visual diffs and visual regression testing.</p>
<p>What he didn’t expect in Applitools were the internal tools for communication inside the Applitools UI to help communicate his findings to teammates. He really liked the productivity aspects of Applitools.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/653686.png" alt="653686" class="wp-image-18502" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/653686.png 1277w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/653686-300x143.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/653686-1024x489.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/653686-768x367.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1277px) 100vw, 1277px"/></figure>
<p>He had a little bit of trouble getting started with branching. Thai had prior experience with gitbranch, and he expected Applitools to behave similarly. It took him a while to get the behaivor the way he expected, but he figured it out.</p>
<p>Thai realized how easy he found it to run visual regression testing with Applitools Visual AI.</p>
<p>Working on the Hackathon, Thai realized the number of test cases that he could not cover with traditional assertions. For example, an icon disappearing can still show up in the DOM, even if it disappears for the user.  He generally wouldn’t write a test to see if a button had moved, and that kind of test comes for free when using Visual AI</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-13-at-12.15.01-PM-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-18501"/></figure>
<p>Thai realized the number of cases that Visual AI could cover that his traditional assertion-based testing would miss.</p>
<h2 id="h.g6horq3t0hu2">Ideas For Improvement</h2>
<p>Thai’s big takeaways come from his perspective as an architect by day and running his own development projects in non-work hours. Thai likes to experiment, which explains how an architect got involved in a Visual AI hackathon. He liked the idea of learning something new.</p>
<p>While Thai figured out the Github integration, he’d love it to be easier (something we continue to improve). He loved a lot of the other collaboration capabilities inside Applitools.  </p>
<p>Thai works constantly to improve his productivity. As a contributor to open-source projects, Thai likes working with open-source tools. He has worked on several projects. As a coder, he discovered that the more code he wrote in a project the more likely he would write bugs. He picked up testing skills to help catch bugs in his own code.  </p>
<p>To help improve open-source projects, Thai said he could see the use of an open-source version of Applitools as a testing solution. He would love to have an open-source solution that would allow him to share with other developers in an open-source dashboard that didn’t require a login. Such a dashboard would give coding teams visibility into bug impact from different code additions.</p>
<h2 id="h.jwq1bjjb1zt2">Takeaways</h2>
<p>Overall, Thai enjoyed his experience working on the Hackathon.</p>
<p><em>Thai Pangsakulyanont won a Platinum award for his experience in the Applitools hackathon.</em></p>

<p>Despite a significant uptick in awareness of DevOps security issues, many companies aren&#8217;t on top of the software development security challenges they face, and must rely on outside teams to handle their software security program. </p>
<p>Surveys show that there is significant resistance to<a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/primer-secure-devops-why-devsecops-matters" rel="noopener noreferrer"> company-wide DevSecOps implementations</a>, and that many managers view incorporating security standards into DevOps processes as a roadblock to agile software delivery.</p>
<p>Why the negative attitude toward DevSecOps rollouts with so many software managers? For starters, many DevOps professionals <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-bridge-security-development-divide" rel="noopener noreferrer">don’t want to sacrifice speedy application development</a> and deployment for a secure environment, complete with the frequent testing and tracking that comes with DevSecOps.</p>
<p>Another factor is that many software managers don&#8217;t understand how to properly <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/what-your-devops-team-needs-know-4-lessons-exploited-vulnerabilities" rel="noopener noreferrer">implement a security program into their DevOps programs</a>. That’s why many organizations are continuing to struggle with implementing security standards in their DevOps platforms.</p>
<p>For software development managers who want to get off the fence and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/state-of-application-security-testing-tb/shift-security-left-continuous-testing?lx=QKJph-&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">improve their security effectiveness</a>, the best incentive may be to check out what happens when you <em>don&#8217;t</em> deploy a DevSecOps security program. Here&#8217;s a closer look.</p>
<p><em>[ Continuous delivery and release automation (CDRA) demands speed and quality. Find out how in <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechBeacon&#8217;s guide to CDRA</a>.

<h3>Reputational damage gets real</h3>
<p>Fewer customers want to do business with a company that doesn&#8217;t take data security seriously, and even fewer employees want to work for that company.</p>
<p>Case in point: In 2015, UK-based TalkTalk suffered a data breach that compromised the personal data of 157,000 customers, and exposed the bank records of 20,000 of them. </p>
<p>When the UK’s Information Commissioner Office <a target="_blank" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/talktalk-fine-data-breach-theft-customers-information-stolen-record-penalty-a7346316.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">cited the company for &#8220;multiple failings&#8221;</a> in its security processes, the broadband provider <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/talktalk-hack-customers-lost" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">lost 100,000 customers</a>—and a big chunk of its information technology team, many of whom were too embarrassed to work at the company any longer.</p>
<p>Brand distancing often happens in the aftermath of a major data hack, and not implementing stronger security measures is a major reason why reputational damage is so severe. Bugs linger, and product rollouts get delayed.</p>
<p>One of the most significant benefits from having a solid DevSecOps program is that your software security teams, usually through repeated testing, can identify system vulnerabilities early and fix them in time. That means little or no delay in software rollouts and software projects that come in clean.</p>
<h3>Security and speed: You <em>can</em> have both</h3>
<p>If you don&#8217;t spot system vulnerabilities early in the DevOps process, all that time spent on agile software coding and development can go for naught. Not only are deadlines threatened, but new or revamped company products and services—the bread and butter of any business—are delayed.</p>
<p>This costs the company staffing time (to fix the vulnerabilities while plugging the pipeline) and money (in the form of delayed orders and delayed payments from vendors, partners, and customers).</p>
<p>Your software developers already have plenty to do when creating and installing functionality for your products, yet one of the strongest tenets of DevSecOps is the increased data security knowledge that those software developers gain as key members of a data software security team.</p>
<p>With DevSecOps, software developers are on the front lines of data security, fully trained on the security side of software builds and capable of spotting coding errors as they happen. </p>
<p>In the end, you’ve got not only a seasoned software developer who knows how to generate code and push deadlines through to the end, but also a curious and plugged-in data software system specialist who can help save you time and money down the road, as your DevOps program expands and the stakes grow higher for your company.</p>
<p>You run the risk of financial and legal liability. No savvy company decision makers should ignore DevSecOps, considering the <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/32-application-security-stats-matter" rel="noopener noreferrer">huge costs associated with breaches</a>. Instead, they should think about investing in cost-saving DevSecOps training, testing, and implementation.</p>

<h3>Ignore DevSecOps at your own risk</h3>
<p>The downsides associated with avoiding software security practices can be measured far beyond the most pervasive issues I&#8217;ve cited above—brand damage and legal and compliance costs among them.</p>
<p>Rather than simply accepting these risks, get proactive and go full throttle with a software security plan that takes all of the above issues off the table—for good.</p>
