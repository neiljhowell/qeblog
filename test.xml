										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>If the pandemic has taught organizations anything, it&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cyber-resilience-tb/cyber-resilience-get-started?lx=dSbBFJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">the value of resiliency in the face of sudden adversity</a>. That&#8217;s made migration to cloud operations more attractive than ever as a means of ensuring that critical functions are &#8220;always-on&#8221; and that customers are receiving great experiences anytime and anywhere, cost-effectively.</p>
<p>While moving IT operations from a local data center to the cloud can enable business growth by protecting business assets and building customer trust, it&#8217;s important to understand that <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cloud-security-data-privacy-tb/bring-your-own-key-cloud?lx=8rSV2a&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">a cloud provider isn&#8217;t completely responsible for privacy, security, and compliance</a>. Final responsibility lies with your organization to securely configure, manage, and operate cloud services and protect cloud-based assets.</p>
<p>To meet those responsibilities, organizations should adopt several practices focused on data and application security, identity management, and network monitoring. Here are the key ones.</p>
<h2>Secure your data on cloud</h2>
<p>Protecting data throughout its lifecycle—from creation to disposal—is vital. With petabytes of data streaming into enterprises and then to the cloud, lots of sensitive personal data requires protection. Managing and protecting sensitive data throughout its lifecycle is a vital parameter.</p>
<p>Transparent and open <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/what-weakening-encryption-would-mean-enterprise-data-security" rel="noopener">encryption</a> methods should be used to secure sensitive data wherever it resides.</p>
<p>Protection should be simple and lightweight. That will reduce the potential impact on productivity and business operations of encrypting and decrypting the data, as well as maintaining its usefulness for performing cloud-based big data analytics and business processes.</p>
<p>To ensure data security and privacy, transparent governance and compliance reporting should be done from a single pane of glass, comprehensively across different compliance regimes and across multi-cloud, hybrid cloud, and on premises.</p>
<h4>Avoid cloud service lock-in</h4>
<p>Data should be secured so it&#8217;s highly portable across multi-cloud environments.</p>
<h4>Classify your data</h4>
<p>There is a cost to protecting data in the cloud. By classifying your data assets, you can manage your levels of protection, making sure critical data receives the highest levels of protection and that controls are applied appropriately to data based on its characteristics.</p>
<h2>Integrate security onto cloud application development</h2>
<p>You should embed and integrate security controls in your development lifecycle.</p>
<p>Unlike on-premises applications, software running in hybrid and multi-cloud environments contains multiple dependencies and requires integration objects. That can create security challenges if you try to bolt on security controls at the end of the development lifecycle.</p>
<h4>Enable integrated security testing for open-source libraries and APIs</h4>
<p>Third-party and open-source libraries have become an integral part of most applications these days. The security of many of these components is not always well known. When enabling integrated security testing to identify vulnerabilities in your apps, that testing should also inspect open-source libraries and APIs.</p>
<h4>Remediate security problems in a timely and appropriate manner</h4>
<p>Security assessments are useful only if their findings are acted on before they become irrelevant. That requires continuous monitoring, remediation, and developer education.</p>
<h2>Enable contextual and risk-based adaptive access management</h2>
<p>It is critical to adopt a zero-trust model.</p>
<p>With the &#8220;data everywhere&#8221; environment that many organizations operate in—an environment expanded by the need to work at home during the pandemic—identity relationships have risen to a new level of importance. <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/zero-trust-cloud-native-world-best-practices-emerge" rel="noopener">Zero-trust</a> identity management, with contextual risk, should be at the center of any adaptive authentication, access management, and governance system.</p>
<p>By creating a context for users, devices, and applications based on factors such as behavior, location, and network presence, the risk to a system can be evaluated and privileges assigned at appropriate levels.</p>
<h4>Centralize lifecycle management and governance of identities</h4>
<p>Cloud environments can make managing roles and entitlements complex. Centralizing lifecycle management and governance of identities helps reduce identity fraud or risk of compliance oversight.</p>
<h2>Detect, defend, and respond to incidents faster and more effectively</h2>
<p>Continuous monitoring for exposures and breaches is critical.</p>
<p>In the wake of the pandemic, data breaches skyrocketed. Based on the <a target="_blank" href="https:/pages.riskbasedsecurity.com/en/2020-q1-vulnerability-quickview-report" rel="noopener">latest data breach data</a> from RiskedBased Security, at least 8.4 billion records were exposed in more than 1,100 breaches in the first quarter of 2020. Detecting and responding to a potential data breach faster and quicker helps in reducing risk and damage.</p>
<h4>Monitor logs across your operational environment</h4>
<p>You can enhance the visibility of your assets and build a better picture of your threat landscape by collecting logs from across your operations area and monitoring them for security events in the cloud, on premises, and in vendor and customer environments.</p>
<h4>Use analytics to triage alerts, hunt for threats, and perform real-time analysis of threats</h4>
<p>External and internal intelligence can be used to build the awareness needed for faster response to threats. Alert quality can be improved by continuous analysis of false positives using contextual behavior.</p>
<h4>Accelerate decision-making through risk-based insights</h4>
<p>Risk-based insights can speed up decisions at the time of an incident by allowing you to understand the risk score of your enterprise at any moment in time.</p>
<h4>Automate actions and responses</h4>
<p>Repetitive actions should be automated. In addition, some incidents can be mitigated with a routine response that can be automated. Automation can improve the efficiency of operations and save time for security analysts. It can also help reduce the time to respond to incidents effectively.</p>
<h2>Comprehensive cyber resiliency for a secure cloud</h2>
<p>While migration to the cloud can benefit organizations by optimizing costs, improving efficiencies, and speeding up the time it takes to bring products to market, those benefits can be squandered unless measures are taken to build resiliency into your cloud presence.</p>
<p>It is important to have comprehensive security controls in your cloud to build cyber resiliency and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-pandemic?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener">help accelerate business transformation</a>. You must ensure that security controls are embedded in your cloud transformation journey to take full advantage of what the cloud has to offer.</p>
<h4>Keep learning</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>Itay Yelin has been with Applitools for more than a year now. He’s an Algorithms Developer on our Computer Vision team, and an avid canyoneer! You can find him in his spare time exploring slot canyons in locations like Jordan and Utah. He’s also a dedicated volunteer at Hoshen, a non-profit LGBT organization promoting acceptance and driving change in Israeli education systems.</p>
<p>At Applitools, Itay is working to push the boundaries of automatic understanding of web pages and applications and is on a mission to help engineering teams worldwide release visually perfect User Interfaces. We sat down with Itay to find out what brought him to choose a career in computer vision, and what an average day for him looks like.</p>
<p>We also picked his brain on what he plans to tackle next.</p>
<h3 id="h-itay-can-you-tell-us-about-your-current-work-at-applitools">Itay, can you tell us about your current work at Applitools?</h3>
<p>I joined Applitools last August. Since then I have been researching how we can improve on paragraph algorithms and visual text parsing algorithms. The way that this relates to the Applitools product: our product tries to understand content from an AI perspective. To be able to detect visual bugs that are critical, we are teaching a machine not only to differentiate text from photos, but also recognize more sophisticated page elements like paragraphs or product descriptions for example, if its a commercial site. When we’re understanding the page structure we can detect the most critical bugs, if there are any, and alert the user.</p>
<p>This is a highly complicated task to research, and I find it challenging because it was never done before: you find yourself oftentimes faced with an ambiguous situation from which you start translating product problems into actual algorithms.. It is fascinating work.</p>
<h3 id="h-can-you-tell-us-about-your-background-how-did-you-get-started-in-computer-vision-and-algorithms-research">Can you tell us about your background? How did you get started in Computer Vision and Algorithms research?</h3>
<p>I’ve done my Masters thesis at Tel Aviv University, as a collaborative work with Yale University. I was researching multi-modal sensor registration, and after I graduated, I spent a few years in the industry working for medical startups. Among other projects, I developed 3D segmentation of arteries and researched image tracking algorithms. It was there where I gained most of my knowledge of computer vision and image processing.</p>
<h3 id="h-what-motivated-you-to-apply-to-applitools">What motivated you to apply to Applitools?</h3>
<p>What Applitools develops is unique, I’ve never heard about a company trying to tackle the same challenge and it sparked my interest. The set of problems we encounter here are new, so I can say I was intrigued by the challenge, but at the same time excited about the people behind the company. After coming onsite for my interviews, I was looking forward to being part of this team: they seemed like a group of smart folks, that are fun to work with. Our group leader, Ram Nathaniel, is an incredible person, he’s great as a mentor, who truly sets a high bar for professionalism and I find this is the best way to improve my skills.</p>
<h3 id="h-what-surprised-you-most-about-applitools">What surprised you most about Applitools?</h3>
<p>I would say the willingness to be open to changes in architecture, given the restriction of the way the algorithm is built. What is unique about the way our team works is the special attention put into writing robust efficient clean code and strictly keeping a clean process, it reduces a lot of the stress that other algorithms teams experience sometimes. It allows me to work in a more relaxed and organized manner.</p>
<h3 id="h-what-does-a-typical-day-look-like-for-you">What does a typical day look like for you?</h3>
<p>Our mornings usually start with team sync over coffee or breakfast. Then we start prioritizing the day’s work, this is a startup and things are constantly changing. We need to keep close communication methodologies and discuss between us what we work on. I love the small breaks we take during the day, every time you’re grabbing a cup of coffee you’ll easily find someone friendly to talk to and this is a great opportunity to interact with folks outside our team. There are team members here with intriguing hobbies and areas of interest that I very much enjoy connecting with and learning more about. The levels of discussions we find ourselves diving into are intriguing. This is especially great as people here come together from very different types of backgrounds (some come from religious backgrounds, some relocated from other countries, etc). Across the board, it feels like everyone is genuinely friendly, open, and very passionate about teamwork.</p>
<h3 id="h-what-can-we-find-you-doing-outside-of-work">What can we find you doing outside of work?</h3>
<p>I like to spend my free time climbing or volunteering. Over the weekends, I sometimes organize hikes for my LGBT outdoor group or indulge my passion for canyoneering in the Israeli desert.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />

<div>
<p>Appium is an open source test automation framework for use with native, hybrid and mobile web apps.</p>
<p>It drives iOS, Android, and Windows apps using the WebDriver protocol and gives you the ability to automate any mobile app from any language and any test framework.</p>
<p>Appium released its first major version almost 7 years ago. Since then, Appium has rolled out a lot of new features and its automation backend architecture has evolved quite a lot. </p>
<p>That said, getting started with implementing automated tests and executing them using Appium the 1st time can be a daunting experience.</p>
<p>There are a lot of dependencies that need to be set up – node, android-command-line tools, appium, etc.</p>
<h2 id="h-appium-setup-scripts">Appium Setup Scripts</h2>
<p>In order to make this task easier, and avoid having to do this manually, one at a time, I have written a script that will help set the Appium-Android environment automatically for you. The script is available for Mac OSX and Ubuntu and will set up the latest available version of the dependencies &amp; appium itself.</p>
<p>You can find the scripts here:</p>
<p>MacOSX: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anandbagmar/AppiumJavaSample/blob/master/setup_mac.sh" rel="noopener">setup_mac.sh</a></p>
<p>Ubuntu: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anandbagmar/AppiumJavaSample/blob/master/setup_linux.sh" rel="noopener">setup_linux.sh</a></p>
<p>The mentioned setup scripts install all dependencies required for implementing / running tests on Android devices. To do the setup for iOS devices, run <strong><em>appium-doctor</em></strong> and see the list of dependencies that are missing, and install the same.</p>
<p>To ensure the setup is working properly, you can clone / download this sample repository (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anandbagmar/AppiumJavaSample" rel="noopener">https://github.com/anandbagmar/AppiumJavaSample</a>) which has 2 tests that can be executed to verify the setup. </p>
<p>Refer to the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anandbagmar/AppiumJavaSample/blob/master/README.md" rel="noopener">README</a> file for specifics of the prerequisites to do the setup and also for running the tests.</p>
<p>To get full value of your functional test automation, add the power of Visual AI to your tests. You can refer to the relevant tutorial for adding Applitools Visual AI to your Appium tests from <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h-summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Automate your Android and Appium test execution environment setup using an automated script on MacOSX (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anandbagmar/AppiumJavaSample/blob/master/setup_mac.sh" rel="noopener">setup_mac.sh</a>) and Ubuntu (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anandbagmar/AppiumJavaSample/blob/master/setup_linux.sh" rel="noopener">setup_linux.sh</a>).</p>

<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>On February 17<sup>th</sup>, 2021, McAfee <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/dont-call-us-well-call-you-mcafee-atr-finds-vulnerability-in-agora-video-sdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">disclosed findings</a> based on a 10-month long disclosure process with major video conferencing vendor Agora, Inc.  As we disclosed the findings to Agora in April 2020, this lengthy disclosure timeline represents a nonstandard process for McAfee but was a joint agreement with the vendor to allow sufficient time for the development and release of a secure SDK. The release of the SDK mitigating the vulnerability took place on December 17<sup>th</sup>, 2020. Given the implications of <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/ApphMr2k5QE" rel="noopener noreferrer">snooping and spying on video</a> and audio calls, we felt it was important to provide Agora the extended disclosure time. The affected users of Agora include popular voice and video messaging apps, with one notable application being the popular new iOS app known as Clubhouse.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-117547 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1.png" alt="" width="403" height="660" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1.png 403w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-183x300.png 183w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-79x129.png 79w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px"/><br /><em>Clubhouse Application Screenshot</em></p>
<p>Clubhouse has made headlines recently as one of the newest players in the social networking sphere, rising in popularity after a series of high-profile users including Elon Musk, Kanye West and influencers in various geographies posted about the platform. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clubhouse_(app)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Released in April of 2020</a>, Clubhouse quickly carved out a niche in Chinese social media as the platform to discuss sensitive social and political topics – perhaps aided by its invite-only approach to membership – and the spotlight shined on it by these key players further propelled it into viral status early this year. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the application was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china-ban-clubhouse-reports-social-app-users-avoid-government-censorship-2021-2" rel="noopener noreferrer">blocked for use in China</a> on February 8<sup>th</sup>, 2021.</p>
<p>Last week, Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO) <a target="_blank" href="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/clubhouse-china" rel="noopener noreferrer">released research</a> regarding the popular Clubhouse app’s use of Agora real-time engagement software and suggested that Agora could have provided the Chinese government access to Clubhouse user information and communications.  While the details of Stanford’s disclosure focus on the audio SDK compared to our work on the video SDK, the functionality and flaw are similar to our recent disclosure, CVE-2020-25605.  This includes the plaintext transmission of app ID, channel ID and token – credentials necessary to join either audio or video calls. We can confirm that Clubhouse updated to the most recent version of the Agora SDK on February 16<sup>th </sup>– just a day prior to our public disclosure.</p>
<p>Despite the recent noise surrounding Clubhouse, the reality is that this application is just one of many applications that leverage the Agora SDK. Among others, we investigated the social apps eHarmony, Skout, and MeetMe, along with several widely-used healthcare apps, some of which have a significantly larger user base. For example, MeetGroup (comprised of several apps) reported approximately 18 million monthly users compared to Clubhouse, which had approximately 600k total users as of December 2020.</p>
<p>We felt it was important to highlight these data points and are continuing to investigate these applications as well as monitor any potential instances of malicious actors exploiting this vulnerability. Given that Agora has released an updated SDK that fixes the call setup issues, vulnerable applications should have already switched to the secure calling SDK, thus protecting the sensitive audio and video call data as many claim to do. With that in mind, we decided to check back in with some of the Agora-based apps we previously investigated to confirm whether they had updated to the patched version. We were surprised to see many, as of February 18, 2020, still had not:</p>

<p>With the context around censorship and basic privacy concerns, it will be interesting to see if these and many other apps using the vulnerable SDK update quickly, or even ever, and what kind of lasting effects these types of findings have on users’ trust and confidence in social media platforms.</p>
