</p>
<div>
<p>Can you double or triple the speed of your test runs by switching out a few lines of code?</p>
<p>That’s what the team at Applitools is promising.</p>
<p>They’ve challenged test automation teams to speed up their test suites with their new Ultra-Fast Grid (UFG), which provides “massively parallel test automation across all browsers, devices, and viewports.”</p>
<p>To try it out myself, I took part of their Cross Browser Testing Hackathon, seeing if their new grid lived up to its claims.</p>
<h2 id="whatsthecrossbrowsertestinghackathon">What’s the Cross Browser Testing Hackathon?</h2>
<p>In June of this year (2020), Applitools held an online Cross Browser Testing Hackathon. The challenge was to complete three automation tasks, attempting to catch bugs between two versions of the same app, using two different techniques.</p>
<p>While I really wanted to participate in it, I also needed to focus my efforts on my book, <a target="_blank" href="https://leanpub.com/webapp-testing-guidebook" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Web App Testing Guidebook</a>. As much as I wanted to, I just didn’t have to the time to commit to the hackathon.</p>
<p>So it came and went and I moved on with life. A few months later, Applitools reached out and asked if I’d be interested in covering the content via a series of live streams, plus this blog post. I thought the opportunity was a great fit, since I already had an interest in the topic, plus the work on my book had mostly wrapped up.</p>
<p>At this point, I should mention that Applitools is sponsoring all of this. I do my best to stay objective, but I want to be transparent with that.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote">
<blockquote>
<p>“…with the UFG, you run your test setup scripts… once on your local machine, then the Applitools code takes a snapshot of the page HTML &amp; CSS and sends it to the grid for processing. This means that we can run our filtering steps in the desktop view, yet still be able to capture our screenshots in mobile view via Applitools.</p>
<p><cite>–Kevin Lamping</cite></p></blockquote>
</figure>
<p>I should also mention what Applitools does. They are a “Next generation test automation platform powered by Visual AI”. I’m a big fan of Visual Regression Testing, seeing that I help maintain <a target="_blank" href="https://visualregressiontesting.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">visualregressiontesting.com</a> and have covered the approach many, many times since <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE_19L0l2q0" rel="noopener noreferrer">I first came across it</a> back in 2013.</p>
<p>Applitools takes the Visual Regression Testing approach to a new level, which I talk about in my blog post “<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.kevinlamping.com/visual-regression-testing-is-stupid/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Regression Testing is Stupid</a>.”</p>
<p>The reason that Applitools put on the hackathon was to get people to try out their new “Ultra-Fast Grid”. Rather than try and describe what that is myself, I’ll use their own words: “With Ultrafast Grid, you run your functional &amp; visual tests once locally and it instantly renders all screens across all combinations of browsers, devices, and viewports. This is all done with unprecedented security, stability, and speed, and with virtually no setup required.”</p>

</p>
</figure>
<p>We’ll get to my thoughts on the UFG (Ultra-Fast Grid) in a bit, but let’s cover what the Hackathon entailed first. Here’s how <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/cross-browser-testing-hackathon-v20-1-instructions-internal/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the project page</a> introduces the challenge:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Imagine you are a test automation engineer for “AppliFashion”, a high profile e-commerce company that sells fancy shoes. The AppliFashion web app is used by millions of people, using various devices and browsers to buy shoes. The 1st version of the app (V1) is already built and is “bug-free”. Your developers are now coming up with a newer version, version (V2) of the app, and assume that it’s full of bugs.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>The challenge is to build the automation suite for the first version of the app and use it to find bugs in the second version (V2) of the app. You need to automate three (3) main tasks across seven (7) different combinations of browsers and screen resolutions (viewports). Further, you need to automate the tasks in both the traditional approach and the Modern approach through Visual AI, for both V1 and V2 versions of the app. By “traditional approach”, we mean without using Applitools Visual AI. You can execute the traditional tests either locally or by using other cross-browser cloud solutions that you are already familiar with.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a pretty realistic scenario in my mind. That’s one of the things I really appreciated about this entire challenge; the scenarios were very “real world”. They took the time to create a project that reflected what you may face in a work-related project. I think that’s a testament to how valuable Visual Regression Testing can be.</p>
<h2 id="howididit">How I Did It</h2>
<p>Over a series of three 2-hour live streams, I worked through the three tasks assigned to the project (completing one task each stream).</p>
<p>As for tooling, I’m a huge fan of <a target="_blank" href="https://webdriver.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebdriverIO</a>. I used it, plus <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@applitools/eyes-webdriverio" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Applitools WebdriverIO SDK</a>, for my test framework. I also used Sauce Labs for my traditional cross-browser testing needs.</p>
<p>You can find a copy of the final code here:<br /><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/klamping/applitools-hackathon-2020" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/klamping/applitools-hackathon-2020</a></p>
<p>Now let’s talk through each task. For the sake of brevity, I’ll be going through a high-level overview of each task, what I did, and my impressions comparing “traditional” testing vs. the Applitools “modern” approach.</p>
<h3 id="task1crossdeviceelementstest">Task 1 – Cross-Device Elements Test</h3>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">
<p>
<iframe title="Comparing Cross-browser Testing Techniques (Part 1 of 3) - Live Stream" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kViTmxBWGjo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p><figcaption>Video Replay of Stream #1</figcaption></figure>
<p>The challenge started off with a relatively simple set of tests. The test would compose of loading the homepage, then validating the correct elements appear (or don’t) on the page.</p>
<p>Most of my time was spent on getting my project initialized and set up. I’m fairly familiar with WebdriverIO, so installation and configuration went pretty smoothly.</p>
<p>One challenge of the project is to test on multiple browsers <strong>and</strong> multiple viewports. The site being tested is responsive, so we needed to handle that functionality.</p>
<p>To handle this, I took advantage of the WebdriverIO <code>setWindowSize</code> command. Using it, plus a defined set of viewports, I was able to switch viewport size around as needed.</p>
<p>I added a few element display checks, but didn’t go too far down that path. Element display checks are pretty routine in WebdriverIO, so I didn’t feel like spending time repeating the same code again and again. In a real test I’d definitely want to though.</p>
<p>After writing the traditional tests, I switched to setting up Applitools and the Ultra-Fast Grid.</p>
<p>While there is <a target="_blank" href="https://webdriver.io/docs/applitools-service.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">an Applitools service for WebdriverIO</a>, it’s not updated to support the UFG yet, so I stuck with using the SDK they provide.</p>
<p>I had to read through <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/webdriverio5.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">the documentation</a> a bit to get it all set up, but I was able to figure it out without too much pain.</p>
<p>After setting it up, writing my test was an absolute breeze. This is essentially the entirety of my test script:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>home.load();

browser.call(() =&gt; {
    return eyes.check('Cross-Device Elements Test', Target.window())
})
</code></pre>
<p>All we do is load the home page, then take a screenshot of the entire window, then send it off to Applitools.</p>
<p>Already, there’s a large difference between the traditional approach of manually writing element display checks, and just relying on the Applitools AI to handle all of that for us.</p>
<p>This is one of the true powers of Visual Regression Testing (VRT), and it shines in this example. VRT implicity checks text content, color, display, size and much more without you having to specifically ask for it for each and every element. It really is a fantastic technique for testing the UI of sites.</p>
<p>But, did the UFG live up to its promise of fast speeds? Well, at this point, not really.</p>
<p>For a good reason though. The tests we’ve written so far are extremely simple. They load a page and check a couple of items. There’s no login steps or other preperation steps needed to get to where we need to be in order to test. Because of that, the UFG doesn’t really get to flex its muscles and show off. But it’ll show off soon enough.</p>
<h3 id="task2shoppingexperiencetest">Task 2 – Shopping Experience Test</h3>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">
<p>
<iframe title="Comparing Cross-browser Testing Techniques (Part 2 of 3) - Live Stream" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FJI0AwYU_aY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p><figcaption>Video Replay of Stream #2</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next up on task list is to try filtering the product grid. I enjoyed this task, because it gave me the chance to show off how to extend Page Objects through the use of Components. I won’t cover it here, but check out the stream if you’re interested.</p>
<p>The traditional test was pretty straight-forward again. I did need to spend a little bit of extra time handling the filter functionality across viewports, but the way I set up the viewports made this much easier than it could have been.</p>
<p>So how did the modern approach compare? Well, it matched more evenly with the traditional approach this time, taking about the same level of coding effort. Both approaches caught the main bug on V2 of the site, which is that the shoes aren’t properly filtered.</p>
<p>One big difference between the two approaches is that the extra functionality I needed to write to handle the filter viewport differences isn’t needed in the modern approach. That’s because of the way the UFG works.</p>
<p>The reason why is that with the UFG, you run your test setup scripts (e.g., clicking the filter menu and selecting the options) once on your local machine, then the Applitools code takes a snapshot of the page HTML &amp; CSS and sends it to the grid for processing. This means that we can run our filtering steps in the desktop view, yet still be able to capture our screenshots in mobile view via Applitools.</p>
<p>We’ll dive deeper into the benefits of this approach later, but I wanted to mention this specific difference here.</p>
<h3 id="task3productdetailstest">Task 3 – Product Details Test</h3>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">
<p>
<iframe title="Comparing Cross-browser Testing Techniques (Part 3 of 3) - Live Stream" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9WE0UT1g-ME?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p><figcaption>Video Replay of Stream #3</figcaption></figure>
<p>For our final task, we take a look at the product detail page.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we’re able to re-use a lot of our previously written test code, as the steps to select the product needed are almost the same as our previous task (just adding the step to click the product link).</p>
<p>The main challenge of the test is writing the various assertions needed to check all the product details. There are several details to validate, including the name, price, SKU, description and more.</p>
<p>This puts us in a similar situation to Task 1, where we have multiple minor details on a page that we have to write assertions for. And similar to Task 1, using VRT really helps in this regard.</p>
<p>Not only does it help reduce the monotony of writing these assertions, in this task, it caught several bugs that my traditional tests didn’t. This is due to both me taking a shortcut by not writing all my checks, but also because my checks honestly wouldn’t have caught some of the bugs.</p>
<p>Here are three bugs that my traditional tests didn’t catch:</p>
<ul>
<li>SKU Number not shown. This is due to the text color matching the background. WebdriverIO’s <code>isDisplayed</code> command absolutely won’t catch this, since it doesn’t check for text color vs. background.</li>
<li>The text of dropdown changed. This is just too minute of a detail for me to write a test for. If I had to spend my time on things like that, not only would it take forever to write a full test suite, but keeping that suite up-to-date would be an absolute pain.</li>
<li>In the price, it changed from $33.00 to only $33. Again, this would be a very difficult thing to test for and would take a lot of time to get that level of detail using the traditional approach. But using VRT catches it with minimal effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a sneaking suspicion that the project was set up to highlight these sorts of bugs, and I don’t blame the creators one bit for exposing it. VRT is a very powerful technique and there’s nothing wrong about showing off specific examples of why.</p>
<h2 id="overallfeelingsobservations">Overall Feelings/Observations</h2>
<p>So that finishes up all three tasks. Now for some overall observations. I’ve talked about the difference between VRT and traditional testing, so I won’t cover that much here. I hope I made my point there.</p>
<p>But there are several other observations I had over the course of the work.</p>
<h3 id="ufgsspeed">UFG’s Speed</h3>
<p>Let’s look at the speed improvements that UFG claims to provide.</p>
<p>Honestly, in these tasks, UFG’s speed didn’t get to shine. There are a few of reasons why that is.</p>
<h4 id="webdriverioisalreadyfast">WebdriverIO is Already Fast</h4>
<p>The first is that WebdriverIO provides the ability to run tests in parallel by default, so I was able to run all three of my test files at the same time with little effort.</p>
<p>This is important, because if each of my traditional tests take 5 seconds extra, normally that would cost me 15 total seconds. But since those 5 seconds all occur at the same time (since the tests all run at the same time), then the pain is minimized.</p>
<p>But this parallelization only gets you so far. Due to computing limitations, you can only run so many tests at the same time. As you add more tests, you’ll quickly reach the limit of browsers you can run at once.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example of 80 tests that need to run on 8 environments (i.e., different devices/browsers/viewports). You will need to run these 80 tests, 8 times each test, which is 640 total runs.</p>
<p>Even if you could run 20 tests in parallel, you’d still have to go through 32 cycles of testing.</p>
<p>With UFG, you would only need to run 80 tests in parallel once (you can run all the tests on one environment in parallel with WebdriverIO). Divide that by 20, and you have only 4 cycles to complete. That’s 8x faster, because you don’t have to run each test 8 separate times for each environment.</p>
<p>So while it’s not too evident on small scales, once you level up your test suite, UFG’s speed really starts to show.</p>
<h4 id="thespeedpedalwasntpushed">The Speed Pedal Wasn’t Pushed</h4>
<p>While these example tests are useful as a demonstration, they aren’t very complex. They simply don’t do enough compared to what a more real-world example would look like.</p>
<p>Looking back, almost all the tests I’ve written over my career have involved some sort of login flow, which we didn’t have in our examples. And, in my experience, the login flow can be painfully slow, as the tests run through their extensive authorization process.</p>
<p>To simulate a more real-world example, what if we add an arbitrary 10 second pause in our tests? Let’s add it right after we load the page for each of our viewports/tasks. This pause is similar to what a login flow would take to run, so imagine it’s that.</p>
<p><strong>When added up, this 10-second delay would add over 70 seconds to our overall test run using the traditional approach.</strong></p>
<p>Why? Well, since that pause happens in our <code>beforeEach</code> hook, it occurs for each of our tests. With 7 total tests (3 each for Task 1 and 2, and once for Task 3), that’s 70 seconds.</p>
<p>Then, we take that 70 second delay, and multiply it by the number of browsers we’re testing in, which is 3. Now we’re 210 seconds slower due to this unavoidable delay.</p>
<p><strong>The Ultra-Fast Grid avoids most of those slow downs.</strong> Remember, our modern tests only needs to run the setup steps once per file, since the UFG handles the multi-browser aspect of everything.</p>
<p>So at most, we’re going to see 30 seconds added to our tests (10 seconds for each file). That’s three minutes of testing time saved over just 7 tests. And, no matter how many browsers we add to our suite, UFG always only takes 30 seconds, while traditional methods grow and grow.</p>
<h3 id="visualregressiontestingispowerful">Visual Regression Testing is Powerful</h3>
<p>The other part to consider here is that the UFG is running a full visual regression. That’s doing a lot more work than our traditional tests were.</p>
<p>Consider our first task. I ran about two assertions per test, getting the text of a couple elements and checking them.</p>
<p>What did our modern approach check? Well, essentially everything on the page. It checked the display and text of all the elements. It checked their visual display, including color, spacing, font size, font style, on and on.</p>
<p>It checked background colors, images, and overall layout. It ran hundreds, maybe thousdands, of assertions in the time it takes a traditional test to run two.</p>
<p>Aside from the test run time, it also provided a huge amount of savings from the test writing time. I don’t think I can emphasize enough how much simpler it is to write a visual regression check. I can’t imagine having to write all those thousands of assertions myself (or even worse, have to use my own eyes to manually check everything).</p>
<p>So, all those things considered, I really think I barely scratched the surface in the speed improvements that the UFG provides. It’s like taking a race car for a drive through a congested street, when it really deserves to be taken out to the race track.</p>
<h3 id="reducedflakiness">Reduced Flakiness</h3>
<p>Okay, so not only is the UFG faster than traditional testing (while also being far more powerful), it also reduces test flakiness.</p>
<p>By minimizing the number of times we’re going through specific actions, we’re reducing the number of interactions we have with potentially finicky flows.</p>
<p>Take the Login flow for example (which, in my experience, can be flaky on test servers). Say that, through no fault of the tests themselves, there’s an odd bug in the staging environment where every 100th login fails. This isn’t much of an issue for a manual test, since you’d just retry your login. But it’s a real pain for an automated test, since that failure can happen in the middle of a test run.</p>
<p>Using our example of 80 tests on 8 environments from before, using the traditional approach, we’d get at least 6 test failures due to the login bug (we login 640 times, so hit that magic 100 number 6 times).</p>
<p>But with the UFG, we’re only running our 80 tests once. We go from a sure six failures, to likely none at all. Even though we have all the same test coverage from before, we’ve minimized our interactions with the app to avoid errant failures.</p>
<h2 id="onefinalwish">One Final Wish</h2>
<p>I’ll end this all with a wish. I’d love to see <a target="_blank" href="https://webdriver.io/docs/applitools-service.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official WebdriverIO Applitools service</a> updated to include integrating the UFG features.</p>
<p>While Applitools does provide <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/applitools/eyes.sdk.javascript1/tree/master/packages/eyes-webdriverio-5#running-with-the-ultra-fast-grid" rel="noopener noreferrer">an SDK for WebdriverIO</a>, which includes support for UFG, it’s not quite as integrated into WebdriverIO as the <code>@wdio/applitools-service</code> is.</p>
<p>Fore example, for the sake of time during this project, I just copied over my UFG initilization code from test to test. But in a real job, I’d definitely want to avoid that. While I could set it up myself using a custom <code>wdio.conf.js</code> configuration, an update to the <code>@wdio/applitools-service</code> could be made to handle this for me in a simple way.</p>
<p>It would also help avoid having to wrap all my Applitools commands in <code>browser.call</code>, which can get clunky.</p>
<p>WebdriverIO services are perfect for minimizing the set up code. Seeing as there’s already an Applitools service, I hope it gets updated soon so I can use this functionality with even less work!</p>
<p>Overall, I really enjoyed the chance to implement this hackathon, and was impressed with what Applitools has to offer. I’m definitely going to see where I can use this in my work make the move to modern testing!</p>

<div>
<p>APIs are an important interface in the modern computing world, where an increasing amount of applications and sites are hosted on online cloud platforms. APIs allow for communication between different applications which are built on service-oriented architectures, many different companies use the public API approach to share and make their tool more accessible to various users from external sources. Of course, all these APIs must be tested to ensure their functionality and usability, despite lacking a graphical interface and requiring a more programmatical approach, which can make the API testing flows more challenging and intimidating.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/the-ultimate-postman-tutorial-for-api-testing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postman</a> is the #1 tool when it comes to testing your APIs manually, but when it comes to API automation, scheduling and reporting as part of end to end API testing flows, it becomes more challenging.</p>
<p>End-to-end API testing flows can involve multiple input sources, such as HTML, Databases, Telnet/SSH, Mobile, Shell, Data files, other RESTful APIs and more. <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a>‘s test automation platform allows not only testing your APIs manually, but also to complete end-to-end API based test automation flows, schedule and run them periodically, get execution reports and all of that without any third party tools and without a single line of code <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>If you have teens and you haven’t yet heard of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.innersloth.com/gameAmongUs.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Among Us’</a> then I guarantee it won’t be long. Among Us is an online deception and strategy game that is having a real moment worldwide. Over the last six months, it has amassed 85 million players on both PC and mobile. In September, it broke the all-time record-setting peak player ceiling on <a target="_blank" href="https://steamcharts.com/app/945360" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> when nearly 400,000 people played it simultaneously and, Google Trends reports that there were 50 times more Google searches for it at the beginning of October, as compared to the beginning of August.</p>
<h3><strong>What’s The Game About?</strong></h3>
<p>Among Us is an online multi-player game that is set on a failing spaceship. Suitable for up to 10 players, it has been compared to ‘Murder in the Dark’ or ‘Murder Wink’ – the old-school party game you may have played as children.</p>
<p>At the start of the game, you’re advised whether you are a regular crew member or an imposter. Crew mates are tasked with completing small tasks that benefit the spaceship eg cleaning our air-conditioning ducts whereas imposters (between 1-3 players) create havoc on the spaceship and seek out victims to kill – without letting anyone know.</p>
<p>Every time a dead body is found, a crewmember will call a meeting to workshop who they think the imposter is. This is one of the few times players can talk to each other. As you can imagine, this can get very heated (and entertaining) as players try to implicate others and remove themselves from focus. All players then vote on who they think the imposter is – and the player with the most votes is ejected from the spaceship’s airlock.</p>
<p>Crewmates win by managing to repair the ship and eject all the imposters while the imposter wins by killing all the crewmates before they complete their jobs.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Has It Become So Popular?</strong></h3>
<p>Among Us was actually launched in 2018 but to little fanfare. But the planets have aligned for the developers at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.innersloth.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">InnerSloth</a> and it has become one of the biggest online games ever. In fact, it’s so successful that the developers have abandoned plans for a sequel and are instead, investing their resources into perfecting the original.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that pandemic life has contributed to the popularity of Among Us with many touting it as the ultimate group party game. In fact, some believe it brings all the energy and pizazz of board game night – just virtually.</p>
<p>It is extremely easy to learn. So, if you aren’t a gamer with years of experience (that’s me) you can absolutely play. This concept has been described by popular YouTube gamer <a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/Pegasus" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pegasus</a> as ‘ingenious’ for its simplicity, and praised for its ‘extremely social’ nature.</p>
<p>The game is also very well priced. In fact, it’s free on mobile – but you will have to view some ads. And it’s only around $7 on a PC – so much cheaper than anything my kids have played in years!</p>
<h3><strong>What Parents Are Asking</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Is it Suitable?</strong></h4>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/among-us-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Classification Board here is Australia gives Among Us a PG rating</a> which means the content is mild in impact. But they do state that PG rated content is ‘not recommended for viewing by people under the age of 15 without guidance from parents, teachers or guardians.’</p>
<p>In Australia, the game is rated as suitable for 9+ on the App Store. On Google Play it is nominated as suitable for ages 10+.</p>
<p>The role of the imposter in the game to hunt and murder players is aggressive and violent. Yes, it is a cartoon-like visual which does reduce the impact but there are still bodies left lying around after the deed is done.</p>
<p>Parents know their children the best. Absolutely take heed of the advice, but ultimately, you need to decide what’s suitable for them. If you do decide to let your younger children play – or they’ve already discovered it – please talk about violence in video games. Does watching violent images make them feel scared or more aggressive? Do they feel better if they talk about it or, in fact, choose to watch something less violent?</p>
<h4><strong>Can They Chat With Strangers During The Game?</strong></h4>
<p>There is opportunity to chat with strangers in the game but it is less than most online games. Players can chat in the online waiting room before a game starts and of course, there is also interaction in the meetings during which the group tries to work out who the imposter is. Enabling the censor chat mode is a good option here – this limits word and aims to block out expletives however I understand that isn’t completely fool proof.</p>
<p>But you can choose to play the game offline, locally, which means you play only with people you know. You simply share a generated code with the players you want to join the game. I highly recommend this for younger children and teens or if you want to play the game as a family. The game can be played with as few as four players which makes an offline game far easier to get happening.</p>
<h4><strong>Does It Share A Positive Message?</strong></h4>
<p>Both trust and deceit are at the core of this game. Learning who to place your trust in is part of being a successful crewmember in Among Us whilst being a master of deceit will win you the game as an imposter.</p>
<p>You could argue that these themes are no different to playing Murder in the Dark or even the old classic Cluedo. However, I would absolutely have a conversation with your kids about the difference between real life and online (or gaming) life. Why not weave it into your dinnertime conversation?</p>
<p>My boys are really enjoying playing Among Us, in fact – we have earmarked this weekend for a family game. But please ensure you are comfortable with the game before you give your kids the green light. And if you do, be assured that one of the reasons this game is so popular is because players feel like they are part of a community – and isn’t that what we all need at the moment?</p>
<p>‘till next time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>For organizations getting ready to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cyber-resilience-tb/state-secops-beyond-soc?lx=dSbBFJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">move beyond Security Operations with their security approach and improve the cyber resiliency of their systems</a>, some excellent startup tools exist. And, equally important, best practices are emerging.</p>
<p>One of the best places to start your resilience journey is with a cyber-resilience framework. They help an organization establish the goals and objectives for its resiliency strategy, as well as identify specific technologies needed to control, manage, and recover from cyber attacks.</p>
<p>By using a framework, an organization can craft a cost-effective, flexible, prioritized, and performance-based path to cyber resilience. A framework can also help an enterprise assess its current security stance and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cyber-resilience-tb/cyber-resilience-assessment?lx=dSbBFJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">identify areas for needed improvement</a>. As improvements are made, the framework can also be used to assess the progress of a resilience program.</p>
<p>There are a number of popular frameworks, but they all share some common elements. Here&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cyber-resilience-tb/cyber-resilience-get-started?lx=dSbBFJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">what you need to know about them</a>—followed by best practices for cyber resilience.</p>
<h2>Assess the risks</h2>
<p>An organization-wide assessment should be performed to identify all cybersecurity risks to the systems, assets, data, people, and capabilities of the enterprise. Important items covered by the assessment should include what the organization&#8217;s risk management strategy should look like; which cyber risks operations, individuals, and assets in the organization are facing; and what assets the organization uses to accomplish its mission.</p>
<p>When planning for risk management and resilience, organizations should be careful not to over-engineer their schemes, George Platsis, director of cybersecurity for FTI Consulting, <a target="_blank" href="http://securityintelligence.com/articles/creating-roadmap-toward-cyber-resilience/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">wrote recently</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It is a crude metaphor, but managing your cyber risk increasingly becomes more like managing your investment portfolio. It is tailored to you and your expectations. But if you are not on top of what’s going on, increasing complexity could lead to increasing volatility. That means your current and future outlooks could quickly be thrown into jeopardy.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/gplatsis" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">George Platsis</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;More importantly,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;if you are hoping to maximize business efficiency in your operations using this new gadgetry, then you may be setting yourself up for a colossal loss on the downturn, or a massive data breach that is nearly impossible to recover from could occur.</p>
<p>Indeed, IBM&#8217;s annual cyber-resiliency <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-45839&amp;_ga=2.1023858.255029181.1595266313-545301124.1591239208&amp;cm_mc_uid=78530529166215859305703&amp;cm_mc_sid_50200000=83358031595266312380" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">report</a> for 2020 noted that an excessive use of disconnected tools creates complex environments, which can have an adverse effect on an organization&#8217;s ability to detect, prevent, contain, and respond to a cybersecurity incident.</p>
<h2>Tally up your resources</h2>
<p>In addition to assessing risks, it&#8217;s also important to take a tally of resources—both technological and human. Such an analysis may reveal areas where automation or a managed service provider may be useful. Of course, nowadays it&#8217;s necessary to consider privacy issues when evaluating both present and future resources, especially when it comes to monitoring data or storing too much of it for too long.</p>
<p>Another typical recommendation is to develop and implement safeguards to make sure critical services will be delivered successfully. Those safeguards usually include controls to ensure entities have access only to resources needed to do their jobs or functions. They also include security education, which has become increasingly important as more and more employees are forced to work at home, noted James McQuiggan, a security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, a security awareness training provider.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;With COVID-19 and the increased number of people working from home, organizations&#8217; senior management recognize that the employees are being targeted more than before and require additional training to increase their knowledge of various cyber attacks.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/James_McQuiggan" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">James McQuiggan</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Development of activities and actions to identify a risk event quickly is also a common framework recommendation. Organizations need to clearly define the roles and responsibilities in play when a suspicious event is identified. They also should be monitoring their assets and networks for potential cyber risks and anomalies.</p>
<p>After risk events are detected, a response is in order. Frameworks typically recommend that enterprises have response procedures in place, that shareholders within the enterprise coordinate their response to the event, and that action be taken to prevent the event from continuing and spreading.</p>
<p>IBM says that having a cybersecurity incident response plan (CSIRP) is an important component of any resiliency strategy. It cautions, however, that the plans have to be reviewed frequently. &#8220;As the volume and severity of attacks increase year after year, the lack of an updated CSIRP may increase the risk of experiencing a significant disruption to IT and business processes,&#8221; it noted in its 2020 report.</p>
<p>Recovery is also a common characteristic among frameworks. Recommendations in that area involve restoring any damage from a cyber attack and conducting post-mortems to assess what can be learned from the incident to improve resiliency.</p>
<h2>Best practices</h2>
<p>In addition to following a framework, organizations can also follow these five best practices to improve the resilience of their operations.</p>
<h4>1. Tailor your response plans to attacks specific to your industry</h4>
<p>Not only does that save time and money that would have been spent on low-risk threats, but it allows for more detailed planning for real threats.</p>
<h4>2. Increase visibility and reduce complexity by embracing interoperability</h4>
<p>Using tools that are interoperable increases the effectiveness of security teams by helping them more quickly detect and block attacks.</p>
<h4>3. Invest in technologies to accelerate incident response</h4>
<p>Automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud services are some of the leading ways to increase cyber resiliency. Automation can improve not only operational efficiencies, but also the morale of security teams, which will be able to focus their talents on more meaningful activity and be freed of &#8220;scut work.&#8221;</p>
<h4>4. Bring your security and privacy teams together before serious events occur</h4>
<p>IBM found that companies that exhibited strong cyber-resiliency characteristics recognized the important relationship between these teams. Encouraging collaboration between the teams will improve responsiveness to incidents such as data breaches much more so than if the first time groups collaborate is when they&#8217;re thrown together to face a crisis.</p>
<h4>5. Get the company brass on board</h4>
<p>In all organizations, something is more likely to gain traction if it gets buy-in from the executive team. One way to get the attention of C-level executives and board members is to formalize resiliency reporting to them. That way, resiliency can be kept visible to the upper ranks and receive the resources it needs to preserve the revenues and reputation of the organization.</p>
<h3>Take your SecOps to the next level</h3>
<p>Stan Wisseman, chief security strategist at Micro Focus, said the key is to build on the existing tools and best practices to take your security operations to the next level.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some great guidance out there. There&#8217;s a lot of good work that has already been done to help organizations evolve beyond just cybersecurity.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanwisseman/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stan Wisseman</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Keep learning</h4>

<p>Agile methodology should be a seamless setup where anytime, tracking of tests per requirement or story, automated or manual tests executed and results available for monitoring or auditing by key stakeholders. And, automation execution shouldn’t be something only techies can do. Non-technical people in the team should know what is being covered in automated tests for stories.</p>
<p>Mature organizations with agile methodologies, implement tooling to centralize, testing, requirements, defects and reporting at one place for better tracking and also to make informed decisions on the software quality management process.</p>
<p>Recently, I have come across two tools, <strong>qTest </strong>and <strong>Applitools </strong>– integrating them in the agile process will solve above challenges and makes testing practise in an agile environment – transparent, traceable, measurable and efficient.</p>

<h2 id="h.5jgitecfokqa"> qTest</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tricentis.com/products/agile-dev-testing-qtest/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tricentis qTest</a> offers a suite of Agile testing tools designed to improve efficiency and ensure collaboration on your journey to release the best software.</p>
<p>qTest has below components to support agile testing methodologies,</p>
<ul>
<li>qTest Manager – Powerful and Easy-to-Use Test Case Management</li>
<li>qTest Launch – Centrally Manage Open Source Frameworks &amp; Commercial Test Automation Tools</li>
<li>qTest Explorer – Test Execution Recorder &amp; Documentation Tools</li>
</ul>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools </a>Visual AI, provides the software industry’s only AI-powered, deep learning, computer vision engine that replicates the human eyes and brain to test rendered components and pages.</p>
<p>Applitools offers incredible efficiency. A single line of capture can replace dozens of text-based assertions per test.  With Applitools, you create tests faster, and you execute tests in seconds on multiple devices/browser combinations. Applitools helps you ensure perfection across all browsers, screens and viewports. You can even include web accessibility compliance testing at the same time.</p>
<p>Applitools has 40+ SDKs for different programming languages and test runners, covering web apps, mobile apps, screenshot testing, PDF validations, and more.</p>
<h2 id="h.piqab7od5109">Applitools Integration with qTest</h2>
<p>How do we combine visual AI in Applitools with Test management capabilities in qTest to make software testing efficient in Agile methodology?</p>
<p>Common flow of test management in any agile environment is,</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing tests to user stories/requirements.</li>
<li>Execute tests manually or automatically.</li>
<li>Raise defects</li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I’m focussing on the automated tests to explain the benefits of qTest and Applitools integration.</p>
<p>qTest supports multiple test runners like TestNG, Cucumber, JBehave, JUnit, NUnit, MSTest etc that can be used with popular tools like Selenium to run automated tests.</p>
<p>Integrating Applitools with the automation tools and test runners is straightforward. Follow <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tutorials</a>  for a step-by-step guide</p>
<p>I have chosen, Cucumber-Java-Selenium and Applitools combination to explain integration.</p>
<p>Cucumber is most commonly used in agile development for writing automated tests.</p>
<p>Cucumber is a BDD(Behavior-Driven Development) software tool which helps facilitate the use of an easy-to-learn language called Gherkin. The Gherkin language is used for writing user stories in a ubiquitous language which can also be parsed by the test runner software. For details of Cucumber and Gherkin language, please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://cucumber.io/docs" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cucumber.io/docs</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a sample Cucumber scenario, as shown below to launch Tricentis website.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Feature: Browser Test
  Scenario: Search qTest Launch
      Given I am on the Tricentis website
      When I search for “qTest Launch”
      Then I should see qTest Launch item on the Search page</pre>
<p>Applitools should be added to the implementation of the Cucumber steps. If the automation framework uses a page object model then Applitools should be added to page objects.</p>
<p>Applitools requires a Selenium webdriver object to capture a screenshot of the application under test.</p>
<p>The following line of code should be added before capturing the DOM screenshot.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">eyes.open(driver, “Demo App”, “Smoke Test”, new RectangleSize(800, 800));</pre>
<p>Next is to add the Applitools check command to take a full-page screenshot.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">// Visual checkpoint #1 - Check the login page.<br/>eyes.checkWindow(“Login Window”);</pre>
<p>**Please refer to this <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/selenium-java.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorial </a>for the remaining steps and completing the integration.</p>
<p>We have successfully added Applitools code to automated tests.</p>
<h2 id="h-running-tests">Running Tests</h2>
<p>Let’s run the automated tests with qTest Launch or CI/CD tools like <strong>Jenkins</strong>.</p>
<p>Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://documentation.tricentis.com/qtest/9910/en/content/qtest_launch/launch_user_guides/qtest_launch_quick_start_guide.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">qTest Launch</a> for more details.</p>
<p>During the test execution, Applitools takes DOM snapshots of the application under test (as shown below) and sends the snapshot to Applitools server for comparison with visual AI – emulating the human eye and brain.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>
<p>Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools</a> for more details.</p>
<p>So far, we have prepared tests and integrated Applitools and now let’s see the results of integration.</p>
<p>qTest automatically imports automation results to qTest Manager dashboard if tests are executed by qTest Launch. Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://documentation.tricentis.com/qtest/od/en/content/qtest_launch/universal_agent_user_guides/universal_agent_overview.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">qTest Launch</a>  for more details.</p>

<p>qTest Manager dashboard with automation run results.</p>
<p>As shown in the above screenshot, tests are marked passed or failed.</p>
<p>Integrating qTest with Applitools, the advantage is, <strong>qTest marks the test passed or failed depending on the status from Applitools.</strong></p>
<p>Applitools has different status of tests, based on the comparison done by Visual AI.</p>
<p>Please refer to this <a target="_blank" href="https://help.applitools.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007188251-Different-statuses-of-tests-and-steps#:~:text=Unresolved%2D%20A%20test%20which%20has,have%20not%20yet%20been%20reviewed." rel="noopener noreferrer">article </a>for more details.</p>
<p>Let’s click on the test executed and see the details of the execution in both pass and failure scenarios,  </p>
<p><strong>Passed</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>qTest marks the test as <strong>Passed </strong>as Applitools have a taken full-page screenshot of the application and no differences observed with baseline snapshot of the same screen.</li>
<li>Applitools has tested a full-page emulating human eye.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Failed</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>qTest marks the test as <strong>Failed </strong>as Applitools have taken a full-page screenshot of the application and observed differences with the baseline snapshot of the same screen.</li>
<li>Applitools has tested a full-page <strong>emulating human eye </strong>and has found differences that a human eye would visualise by comparing text, images, colour, and contrast.</li>

<p>To know more about Applitools capabilities for testing <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/web-testing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">websites</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/adding-app-visual-management-to-mobile-test/" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile applications</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/3-steps-visual-testing-pdf/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF </a>documents. Please follow the links.</p>
<p>So far, we have achieved below in agile testing practise with integration,</p>
<ul>
<li>Tests are written for user stories</li>
<li>Automated tests are linked to stories</li>
<li>Results have been centralised in one place</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, all the stakeholders, team members should be able to,</p>
<ul>
<li>See the progress of given user story testing</li>
<li>Understand what is been tested in automated testing</li>
<li>See the current state of application</li>
<li>Collaborate and take informed decisions</li>
</ul>
<p>Results are available all time in one place for future reference or auditing purposes, giving agile teams transparency and the ability to trace, measure and increase their efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="h.qpf8blko7i92">Benefits of Integration</h2>
<p>In broader terms, Applitools compliments teams using qTest or any other automation tools to,</p>
<ul>
<li>Test faster with less code or zero code – productivity gain by 70%</li>
<li>Cross Browser testing with no infrastructure cost – coverage increase by 90%</li>
<li>Automation results combined at one place – standardising tools</li>
<li>Fewer defects to production – bugs caught 45% more with Visual AI</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope you liked this blog. Keep Testing!</p>
