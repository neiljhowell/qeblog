<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Performance engineering is about far more than just performance testing. It&#8217;s about achieving consistent, predictable system performance under load, with changing conditions, and even during a partial system failure.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, performance engineers engage in capacity planning, modeling and simulation, development, performance testing, platform engineering, and production monitoring.</p>
<p>The body of knowledge performance engineers need includes system administration, coding practices, networking, CPU and memory management, the theory of constraints, testing, and traditional debugging skills. More recently, cloud provisioning, DevOps skills, microservices, and non-relational databases have become relevant as well, said Vicky Giavelli, director of product management for performance engineering, Micro Focus</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll need a complete set of tools to engineer performance; the problem is just too broad.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Kwyjiba" rel="nofollow noopener">Vicky Giavelli</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, any systems in the cloud or the data center could become part of a performance engineering effort.</p>
<h4>Why read this report?</h4>
<p>This guide covers the most important benefits of performance engineering, the key features and tools available, and how to select the right tools for the job.</p>
<p>The wrong tool can waste time and money, but the wrong selection process can waste twice as much of both. To help you buy the correct tool and use your time judiciously, this report defines the current state of the tools, including what they offer. You&#8217;ll also learn which criteria to consider for each tool category.</p>
<p>The RFP section covers the questions you should ask performance engineering tool vendors. These are not simple, cut-and-paste, hands-off questions. Instead, to get the most relevant answers, those making the technical selection should work closely with the engineering team and the vendor to select the right questions and provide the right background.</p>
<p>Performance engineering can be challenging, but it does not have to be overwhelming, nor does it need to break budgets or timelines. Understand the problem, model it, test it, evaluate it, improve it, and choose tools to monitor and improve production.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how you take the guesswork out of performance engineering.</p>
<h3>The state of today&#8217;s performance engineering tools and techniques</h3>
<p>The performance engineering discipline is in transition from the old waterfall approach, where performance testing was done by a single expert (if at all), and production monitoring was handled by the IT operations group.</p>
<p>Now that&#8217;s in flux, with the work distributed within engineering teams. Thanks to DevOps, those same teams are adding production deploy and production support to their workloads.</p>
<h4>Performance engineering as a role has diminished</h4>
<p>On one hand, &#8220;everybody pays lip service to performance, and indeed the role of performance and efficiency grows,&#8221; said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/apodelko" rel="nofollow noopener">Alexander Podelko</a>, a consulting performance engineer at MongoDB. &#8220;We are spending more on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But on the other hand, he added, &#8220;the number of people with &#8216;performance&#8217; or &#8216;capacity&#8217; in their titles is shrinking,&#8221; with <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/performance-engineering-now-its-everyones-job" rel="noopener">the responsibility spread</a> between site reliability engineers (SREs), developers, software developers in test (SDET), and so on. &#8220;Yet no one has specific responsibility for the subject.&#8221; </p>
<p>This extra responsibility can lead to waste, with elements of the test picture falling through the cracks. Without anyone to coordinate the process of fixing problems, teams can develop gigabytes of data without any relevant insights, or insights without any actual corrective activity.</p>
<p>In the worst case, this can push teams backwards, from <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/getting-performance-testing-performance-engineering" rel="noopener">performance testing</a> into production firefighting, also known as &#8220;code and fix&#8221; behavior.</p>
<h4>Current tools can be difficult to integrate</h4>
<p>Most performance tools were built for performance testers, to serve a single function. They may be difficult to integrate. And when they do work together, the architecture is frequently closed, encouraging a single-stack, instead of best-of-breed, approach.</p>
<p>Worse, because the responsibility is now distributed to other roles on the team, those people have to leave their work environment and set up an entirely new workspace to do performance. Developers who are offered tools that are not tied to the style or scope of their core work are likely to abandon those tools.</p>
<p>One result: Tools that report on performance are viewed in isolation. Test results are viewed by a &#8220;test group,&#8221; application performance monitoring (APM) data and logs are viewed by operations, and front-end performance, if it is measured at all, is measured by a design or front-end specialist.</p>
<p>There is no shared analysis, especially for complex systems developed by teams in different locations and time zones.</p>
<h4>Performance testing has a high startup cost</h4>
<p>An excellent load test will have multiple users performing somewhat random operations, perhaps from different locations. The test will need to include the accounts, the possible workflows, perhaps logic to track state, as well as meaningful measures on the test data.</p>
<p>That is, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/want-effective-test-automation-devops-manage-your-test-data" rel="noopener">you need all the test data</a>—the average (mean), typical experience (median) load speeds including the front end, as well as perhaps the experience for the slowest 10% or 25%.</p>
<p>Setting all of that up, including creating the test environments, takes a significant amount of time and money. But even more than the tool cost, the human time required to do the work invariably drains the entire delivery team, not just the tester. Physical hardware, which is more often the case than not, can be expensive, especially in large organizations with multiple teams that do not coordinate or reuse resources.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leandromelendez/" rel="nofollow noopener">Leandro Melendez</a>, a consulting performance tester at Qualitest, warns that he still sees many organizations with a physical test environment that&#8217;s a miniature version of production. This saves money but guarantees that the test environment is not a realistic model of production. Since most larger organizations have no way to share performance test resources, teams have to reinvent the wheel, creating more cost and delays.</p>
<h4>Performance testing alone remains a bottleneck</h4>
<p>Given that the setup of performance testing is expensive and slow, it will inevitably push out the schedule. Vicky Giavelli, director of product management for performance engineering at Micro Focus, said that leads to either a delayed release, or, more likely, to an attitude of &#8220;catching it in the next release&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8217;ll test it later.&#8221; This, in turn, inevitably leads to &#8220;testing never&#8221; and firefighting in production.</p>
<h4>Key takeaways</h4>
<p>Large organizations have DevOps teams that tend to focus on infrastructure and setup, leaving testing behind. Without infrastructure, testing falls even further behind. That bottleneck could eventually lead teams to ignore performance testing itself, resulting in production problems that could cost customers, sales, and the expense of fixing the problem.</p>
<p>But the news is not entirely bad. Pushing for teams that &#8220;own&#8221; large parts of the process, from product design to support, creates an opportunity to extend performance engineering <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/software-testing-devops-how-one-qa-team-sets-pace" rel="noopener">throughout all of the delivery lifecycle</a>, from concept to cash.</p>
<p>Centers of excellence and communities of practice can push down information to the team about how to test. As tools evolve to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/9-top-open-source-testing-automation-frameworks-how-choose" rel="noopener">become more open</a> and better integrated, to support the cloud, and to work for different specialties within software development, performance engineering has a chance to become a team sport, with a lighter burden on each person.</p>
<h3>What to look for when building a performance engineering toolbox</h3>
<p>The simplest performance testing toolbox includes a load test generator, hardware to generate that load, and some way to monitor performance. Those tools tell the tester how the system is performing, but they don&#8217;t help fix it. They also don&#8217;t focus on general performance metrics that are unrelated to load, such as unitary, single user, web performance, and so on. </p>
<p>Performance engineering requires a broader approach and perspective. It includes prevention, modeling, analysis, and repair.</p>
<p><em>Figure 1. Performance testing is the least-implemented type of testing within a continuous delivery pipeline, likely due to a lack of proper tools to perform the work. Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.capgemini.com/de-de/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/03/Report_Continous_Testing_2020_Sogeti_Capgemini.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">CapGemini&#8217;s 2020 Continuous Testing report</a></em></p>
<p>Here are the types of tools to use for performance engineering.</p>
<h4>Monitoring</h4>
<p>This isn&#8217;t really a testing tool, but all the load and simulations in the world don&#8217;t mean anything <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/3-highly-effective-strategies-managing-test-data" rel="noopener">without data</a> on system performance. Sometimes called application performance monitoring (APM), these tools should provide drill-down dashboards along with mean, medium, top 25%, bottom 25%, and other metrics on any operation.</p>
<p>A good data dashboard can receive information from anywhere, making it possible to report synthetic transaction results, and logs for delays for every subsystem, along with cloud usage and CPU, memory, and disk use statistics.</p>
<p>This combination for test and production makes finding problems, developing hypotheses, and conducting experiments an engineering exercise, instead of guesswork.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this report, a monitoring tool stores the data, reports on it, and either gathers it or has &#8220;listeners&#8221; that forward the information to it. <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-apm-tools-can-help-predict-prepare-traffic-spikes" rel="noopener">An APM tool</a> will have additional API hooks into the systems themselves to trigger tasks in the system, perform synthetic transactions, or sometimes inject an audit trail into the code itself.</p>
<h4>Load generation tools</h4>
<p>A performance test tool usually means <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/when-should-i-start-load-testing" rel="noopener">a load simulator</a>, scripts and data to send to the load simulator, and a view of results. These tools predate the web and used to run through the user interface. As mobile and microservices have become more popular and software has become incremental, the ability to record production queries and replay them is increasingly popular.</p>
<h4>Front-end performance tools</h4>
<p>These tools analyze what is downloaded, how long it takes, how large the download is, and how that impacts page load. A simple load fix might be to swap out a high-resolution image for a medium-resolution one, or one with better compression. Note that many vendors include front-end performance and load generation in a single tool.</p>
<h4>Service virtualization/mocking</h4>
<p>Some teams directly support only one subset of the system, or a handful of microservices, and those services may be dependent on a wider part of the system. By recording how the other systems interact and then playing it back, it is possible to test just the subsystems a team builds in isolation.</p>
<p>That can lead to faster testing and easier debugging. The term for these lightweight, pre-programmed services with a limited number of requests/responses is &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/service-virtualization-how-misunderstood-tech-could-save-you-millions" rel="noopener">service virtualization</a>.&#8221;</p>
<h4>Network virtualization</h4>
<p>In many cases, the delay is in the network infrastructure outside of the data center. Network virtualization allows a test to simulate a 3G/4G/5G connection, perhaps to a different continent, without the expense of having to fly someone to Europe to use an older phone model. Armed with this data, programmers can reduce the size and complexity of downloads, improving performance.</p>
<h4>Static code analyzers</h4>
<p>While these aren’t typically included in a list of performance engineering tools, they&#8217;re good for finding memory leaks. If your software has memory leaks, which cause delays or errors, a code analyzer could prevent them from getting into your code in the first place.</p>
<h4>Code profiling tools</h4>
<p>A different approach to performance is looking at how long each line of code takes to execute, and how many times it is executed.</p>
<p>Code profiling tools show where the code is spending its time, providing opportunities for improvement. (Of course, it is possible that the network is slow.) This is essentially a dynamic version of code analysis, or analysis as the code runs.</p>
<h4>Query and database optimizers</h4>
<p>A single line of code that takes too long might be calling out to a database. Query optimizers change the way a query or command is structured to make it run faster. Database performance tuning is an entire discipline, but it certainly fits within performance engineering.</p>
<h4>Build and provisioning tools</h4>
<p>These tools allow self-service and the creation of test environments on demand. For a deeper understanding of why these tools are important, read how <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/bernieberger" rel="nofollow noopener">Bernie Berger</a>, an IT and quality coach at EPAM Solutions, described the absence of build tools and test environments in his &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.softwaretestpro.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-software-tester/" rel="nofollow noopener">Day in the Life of a Software Tester</a>&#8221; series of articles.</p>
<p>In Berger&#8217;s examples, the tester might spend four days on setup and configuration to perform a one-hour test. Provisioning tools create a data environment, and possibly seed a test database, so that performance tests can be executed quickly.</p>
<h4>Chaos engineering</h4>
<p>These tools work to pull down subsystems intentionally to see if the architecture has the necessary redundancy to survive failure. Chaos tools plan for failure, simulate it (often in production), and require layers of redundancy to create highly available, resilient architectures.</p>
<h4>Now pull it all together</h4>
<p>There are quite a few types of tools to consider. Fortunately, you probably only need a subset of these tools, and you might want to implement them in a specific order. Given this information, most technical groups should be able to explain what is missing from their current tool lineup, and how any new tools will fit with existing systems to create a performance engineering culture.</p>
<p>The challenge will be deciding who will do the work, how they will find the time to do the work, and the right tool to do the work.</p>
<p>Once you’ve completed these steps you&#8217;re ready to create an RFP and move forward with a proof of concept to help narrow down your tool choices.</p>
<h3>How to create an RFP for performance engineering tools</h3>
<p>Once you understand the landscape of tools, the challenges in your organization, and the relevant features, it is time to get down to tool selection. Part of that process might be creating a request for proposal, or RFP.</p>
<p>The RFP can be an important part of the process of limiting a large group of tools to the select few. That said, Qualitest&#8217;s Melendez warns that the process can remove all context from the conversation. Leaving aside the vendor, making assumptions about what terms such as &#8220;build provisioning&#8221; mean for this particular client or other missteps can lead to the wrong decisions.</p>
<p><em>Figure 2: Accurate performance insights of real users are the top challenge for continuous testing. Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.capgemini.com/de-de/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/03/Report_Continous_Testing_2020_Sogeti_Capgemini.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">Capgemini&#8217;s Continuous Testing Survey 2020</a></em></p>
<p>The RFP process should look more like a conversation, with bidirectional feedback and explanations.</p>
<h4>Describing your company and performance-engineering problems</h4>
<p>Most performance engineering tools solve a specific problem, address a specific need, and work in a single area of performance engineering. Even companies that offer an entire integrated suite of tools, designed to address multiple problems within performance engineering, present those as a suite, not a single tool.</p>
<p>Think of them like puzzle pieces that fit together to craft a solution.</p>
<p>You want to know how the pieces will fit. By describing your organization, the existing performance culture and approach, the desired state, and the gaps you&#8217;re trying to address, you allow the vendor to answer questions about how its piece will help solve the puzzle. The vendor can also suggest anything else that may be needed, based on its experiences with other customers.</p>
<p>This section consists of three components: goals and objectives, resources, and infrastructure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The tool may meet all the requirements, and actually be able to solve our problems. But do our people have the skills and capability to use it as intended? Moreover, will they?&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/perfpulley" rel="nofollow noopener">James Pulley</a>, test practice manager at TEKSystems</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The outline below is a guide; you&#8217;ll want to tweak it to fit your group and the type of solution you&#8217;re seeking. Monitoring tools should have a very different set of questions than performance testing tools.</p>
<p><strong>Statement of goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>Start with the current state of performance engineering. The temptation here is to overestimate the existing state, to talk about the way things should be. Have a technical person, who can set aside bias, write about the true state of what is really happening.</p>
<p>Follow with the end-state goal for performance engineering, any gaps that exist, ideal timelines, and how success will be measured. If you can, include information about budget, existing slow performance, and the effect that improved performance could have on the business.</p>
<p><strong>Statement of resources</strong></p>
<p>This is about who will be doing the performance engineering work—whether it will be an additional duty, whether you will create a specific role or use consultants, the number of people who will be involved, their skill sets, and what group they will report to.</p>
<p>You may also include a high-level description of the IT department, along with more detail on the system administration, database administrators, programmers, team composition, development model, continuous integration approach, DevOps, and other areas that part of performance engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>This section describes the hardware and software elements of your IT environment relevant to performance. That includes the operating system, hardware and database, and the public or private cloud infrastructure and chipset. An all-Microsoft environment and a Linux-heavy environment may lead to very different solutions, as might a Java-, .NET-, or Kubernetes/Docker-heavy group or a particular brand of enterprise service bus.</p>
<p>Include any security issues or relevant regulations. For example, specify if all the software needs to run inside the data center, or if the system needs to be compliant with Sarbanes-Oxley, Dodd Frank, HIPAA, PCI, FDA, or other regulations.</p>
<h4>Soliciting vendor information</h4>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve created the infrastructure section of your RFP, it&#8217;s time to learn about the vendor and its tools. Consider asking the questions below in the vendor information section of your RFP.</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe your company, history, and solution focus.</li>
<li>What is your financial situation? Provide at least two years of financial data.</li>
<li>Who is the primary contact for sales?</li>
<li>Who is the primary contact for technical questions and support during a trial period?</li>
<li>Do you have a list of reference customers we can speak to? If so, please list them along with contact information. Links to case studies are not a replacement, but can be listed here if available.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Products and capabilities</strong></p>
<p>This section allows the vendor to explain its product, approach, and any competitive advantage it has. Ideally these answers demonstrate that the vendor&#8217;s representatives actually read the previous section and understand how their products will fit into your IT picture.</p>
<ul>
<li>List your product or products and the primary category each falls into: capacity planning, modeling and simulation, development and DevOps, performance testing (include web performance and front-end performance), platform engineering, production monitoring.</li>
<li>What technologies and API protocols do you support?</li>
<li>What cloud and virtualization technologies do you support?</li>
<li>What skills are required to use this tool?</li>
<li>How much time and additional training will we need to be effective?</li>
<li>What devices and platforms does the tool support?</li>
<li>Do you provide extensions to support performance engineering for commercial products (ERP, CRM, HR systems, and so on)?</li>
<li>How does your product work with other products—via APIs, or other means? What other products does your software typically interact with? What open-source products?</li>
<li>What continuous integration or continuous delivery tools do you support/integrate with?</li>
<li>Describe how to customize or extend your product.</li>
<li>What types of reporting and analytics does your product provide? </li>
<li>What unique features or innovations does your product suite have compared to the competition? Whom do you consider to be your competition?</li>
<li>Does your product, or product suite, work better as a suite, or as part of a particular stack of technologies?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deployment and support protocols</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is your product or service on premises, a cloud service, or part of a hybrid solution?</li>
<li>Does a typical installation involve consulting or training? Is it via a third party, or do you provide it?</li>
<li>How often are new versions released, and how does that impact the licensing model?</li>
<li>Do you offer support? What are the terms of your support contracts? (It might be helpful to ask for support during the process and see how that goes.)</li>
<li>What training options do you offer, and at what prices?</li>
</ul>
<p>Describe the licensing and pricing model in a separate document. This should include fees for virtual users (for load testing), real users, if the license can float between computers, cloud hosting costs, and so on.</p>
<h4>Once the RFP is drafted</h4>
<p>Pulley, the test practice manager at TEKSystems, provides these examples of problems the RFP should help answer:</p>
<p>(1) Does the tool in question have the ability to interrogate all my systems to understand how resources are being used? (These include operating systems, guest operating systems, and services web server, app server, database server, and so on.)</p>
<p>(2) Does it work in my environment? Does it run on Macs or Linux or Windows or that embedded thing that Bob has running a robot? If not, then it may be a perfectly capable tool but it can&#8217;t be used in my environment.</p>
<p>(3) Can this tool be used successfully by the intended users of the tool? The scripting language is Erlang. No one knows Erlang. Heck, the group is full of manual testers, and almost no one in the group has programming as a background. All performance testing tools assume a robust level of architectural knowledge and programming acumen. You cannot diagnose issues in code and architecture without a foundational command of the same.</p>
<p>Once you get responses to the RFP, take a hard look to see if the vendor really answered your questions or engaged in marketing-speak, and if it seems like it will really work to resolve the performance engineering issues you require.</p>
<p>After the RFP has passed muster with you and your team, send it out for review to any others who will be using the tool. Then it may be time to create your short list and start talking to vendors. Good luck!</p>
<h4>Keep learning</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Digital transformation was gaining momentum before COVID-19 shut down the world last year, but <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-pandemic?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener">the pandemic put the process into hyper-drive</a>. Businesses and consumers have been pushed over a digital fault line where physical channels are moving to digital channels.</p>
<p>While some organizations have scrambled to adjust to this brave new digital world, those that are agile and growth-centric see new opportunities to jump ahead of competitors in their industries. To put more spring into their operations, these organizations are investing in technologies that will make their business operations more agile and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cloud-native-computing-tb/cloud-native-architecture?lx=R4i7m5" rel="noopener">shifting to the cloud</a> for their core operations.</p>
<p>Indeed, to bring new products and experiences to their customers, many businesses have become borderless entities that give customers, employees, suppliers, and other partners access to corporate resources anytime, anywhere. In those environments, access to data is not only important to the members of an organization&#8217;s value chain, but also to the entity itself, which depends on information to gain key business insights, make faster decisions in response to market changes, and stay in tune with customer needs and requirements.</p>
<p>Providing anywhere, anytime access to resources and data—while beneficial for driving efficiency, speed, and flexibility—magnifies the challenges of <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/access-control-pandemic-forces-rethink-its-trust-model" rel="noopener">the challenges of securing the data itself</a><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cloud-security-data-privacy-tb/cloud-security-data-privacy?lx=8rSV2a&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener"> and access to it</a>. These issues are due to the sheer volume and distribution of information created in an anywhere, anytime environment.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why enterprises are placing greater emphasis on <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cloud-security-data-privacy-tb/encryption-vs-tokenization?lx=8rSV2a&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">technologies that protect data and applications</a>, in addition to updating out-of-date policies and procedures for effectively granting access privileges to corporate data wherever it resides.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re on the road to protecting data and applications, it doesn&#8217;t take long to realize the need for cyber resiliency to ensure the business can continue operations in the face of disruptive events such as a pandemic. A key component of establishing cyber resiliency is having a <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cloud-security-data-privacy-tb/cloud-security-data-privacy-trends?lx=8rSV2a&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">comprehensive strategy for data and application protection</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the emerging trends you need to be aware of—and essential best practices—to make cyber resilience happen in your organization.</p>
<h3>The value of data</h3>
<p>First, crafters of such a strategy need to understand the value of data to the business, the liability and risks associated with data, where data resides inside and outside the organization, and the dynamic and distributed nature of data. They also need to know how to classify data.</p>
<p>A comprehensive plan needs to cover the entire data lifecycle—from storage to when it&#8217;s moving to its destruction; otherwise, there&#8217;s a chance of leakage. Having this 360-degree view of data allows for effective decision making to implement the appropriate technologies, policies, and procedures needed for data protection.</p>
<p>Without a 360-degree view of your data, you can end up spending money protecting data that doesn&#8217;t require protection.</p>
<h3>Emerging trends that matter</h3>
<p>As if building a framework and implementing a comprehensive plan to support resiliency weren&#8217;t hard enough, several emerging trends will have a significant impact on how to best manage data, applications, and identities.</p>
<h4>Privacy regulations&#8217; increased complexities </h4>
<p>Measures such as the European Union&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/essential-gdpr-guide-18-resources-get-privacy-compliant" rel="noopener">General Data Protection Regulation</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/what-your-data-security-team-needs-know-about-ccpa" rel="noopener">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> impose restrictions and requirements governing the collection, storage, and handling of data. And more regulatory and legislative actions  in the future will further complicate matters for organizations.</p>
<h4>Software supply chains and the shift required to ensure secure code is embedded in the software development lifecycle</h4>
<p>Increased use of <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/rise-third-party-code-zero-trust-key" rel="noopener">open-source components</a> by enterprise applications has increased supply chain risks. According to <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.sonatype.com/2020-state-of-the-software-supply-chain-report" rel="nofollow noopener">a report</a> by Sonatype, cyber attacks aimed at actively infiltrating open source code increased 430% in 2020 compared to 2019.</p>
<p>By shifting their focus upstream, bad actors can infect a single component, which will then be distributed downstream using legitimate software workflows and update mechanisms, the report said.</p>
<h4>Accelerated digital transformation with the movement of enterprise applications between multi-cloud and on-prem </h4>
<p>Traditional security policies designed to protect on-premises applications are largely ineffective in the cloud. The scale is bigger, and things happen faster than in traditional IT environments. Moreover, there are more things in more places that need to be monitored and protected, which makes automation essential for <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/cloud-misconfigurations-security-5-ways-avoid-your-next-fail" rel="noopener">cloud security</a>.</p>
<h4>The proliferation of connected devices brought about by greater adoption of IoT</h4>
<p>As these devices proliferate, so does <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/7-ways-secure-iot-your-enterprise" rel="noopener">the attack surface</a> for adversaries. Many of the devices connect to IP networks, where they can be attacked from anywhere in the world; can&#8217;t be updated or patched when flaws are discovered; are gaining in capability so they can be used in more sophisticated attacks; and are &#8220;headless,&#8221; so they can be protected only with proximity controls or strong access policies.</p>
<h4>Digital identities and ensuring appropriate governance no matter whether human or a technical element</h4>
<p>Controls need to govern access to resources by people on the network as well as other entities. Use of <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/zero-trust-security-tb/zero-trust-security-matters?lx=9nmHuO&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">zero-trust schemes</a> to govern access has gone from a nice-to-have to a business priority, especially as the remote workforce has ballooned during the pandemic. <a target="_blank" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/latinx/2020/08/19/new-data-from-microsoft-shows-how-the-pandemic-is-accelerating-the-digital-transformation-of-cyber-security/" rel="nofollow noopener">According to Microsoft</a>, 51% of business leaders say they&#8217;re speeding up deployment of zero-trust capabilities, while 94% of companies report they are in the process of implementing new zero-trust systems to some extent.</p>
<h3>Protect your organization&#8217;s value chain</h3>
<p>As the wave of digital transformation breaks over business, protecting data and applications is essential to preserve the integrity of your organization&#8217;s value chain. That protection must foil attacks aimed at compromising data and applications while providing a 360-degree view of data.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll use that view to formulate a comprehensive strategy that will form the bedrock for establishing cyber resiliency throughout your organization.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />

<div>
<p>Who recommends cross browser testing to their organizations? </p>
<p>In this series, we discuss the results of the <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/modern-cross-browser-testing-report/" rel="noopener">Applitools Ultrafast Cross Browser Hackathon</a>. Today, we will explain how those who were skeptics about cross browser testing would recommend that their organizations run <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/product-ultrafast-test-cloud/" rel="noopener">Applitools Ultrafast Grid</a> for cross browser testing.</p>
<h2 id="h-reviewing-past-posts-in-this-series">Reviewing Past Posts In This Series</h2>
<p>In this series we have covered the results of the Applitools Ultrafast Cross Browser Hackathon. </p>
<ul>
<li>My <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/effective-cross-browser-testing/" rel="noopener">first post</a> covered the overall results. I wrote specifically about the ease of creating cross browser tests with Applitools and introduced the topics to follow. </li>
<li>My <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/fast-testing-multiple-browsers/" rel="noopener">second post</a> covered how the speed of Applitools Ultrafast Grid makes cross browser testing a reality within the application build process.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/stability-in-cross-browser-test-code/" rel="noopener">In the third</a>, I explained how Applitools Visual AI tests provide much greater code stability compared with legacy cross browser tests, making the code easier to develop and maintain over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this post, I will cover the survey topic in the hackathon: would Hackathon participants recommend that their organizations adopt legacy cross browser testing approach to their peers, and would they recommend Applitools Ultrafast Grid for that purpose?</p>
<h2 id="h-methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>For this survey, Applitools used an approach called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netpromoter.com/know/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Net Promoter Score</a> (NPS). Net Promoter Score uses a survey question with the highest correlation to satisfaction:</p>
<p>“On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being not likely and 10 being highly likely, how likely are you to recommend [the survey object] to others?”</p>
<p>Researchers have shown that this question correlates most highly with satisfaction. Respondents who give a 9 or 10 (highly likely to recommend) get classified as “promoters.” Promoters have high satisfaction. Those who give a 7 or 8 get classified as neutral – they are neither satisfied or dissatisfied. Others with a 6 or below get classified as detractors. Detractors have been dissatisfied with something and have no willingness to recommend the survey object.</p>
<p>Break the survey responses into respondents by value and count. Add 1 for each 10 and 9. Give 0 for each 7 or 8. Subtract 1 for each 6 or below. Then, normalize the results to 100 by taking your count and dividing it by the number of respondents, and multiplying by 100. </p>
<p>Results can range from -100 to 100. According to Bain &amp; Co, the developers of NPS:</p>
<ul>
<li>80 rates as ‘world class’</li>
<li>50 rates as ‘excellent’</li>
<li>20 rates as ‘favorable’</li>
<li>Around 0 rates as ‘neutral’</li>
<li>-10 and lower rates as ‘negative’</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h-asking-hackathon-participants">Asking Hackathon Participants</h2>
<p>Applitools surveyed the the 2,224 Hackathon participants about their willingness to recommend the use of Applitools Ultrafast Grid to their peers. The survey also asked their willingness to recommend the use of legacy cross browser testing.  Of the participants, 203 engineers were able to run both the legacy and the Ultrafast cross browser tests. </p>
<p>Here were the survey responses:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>
<h3 id="h-few-fans-of-traditional-cross-browser-testing">Few Fans Of Traditional Cross Browser Testing</h3>
<p>For legacy cross browser testing, using a traditional test application and validation process, 68% of participants got classified as detractors. 17% got classified as passives. Only 15% promoted the legacy approach. This gave a NPS of -54 (rounded down). Participants were, in general, not fans of legacy cross browser testing.</p>
<p>This result mirrors how much people use the legacy approach to cross browser testing. Companies listed in the graphic above provide the infrastructure to run tests. They don’t reduce the test load, or the code load. Their pricing reflects the cheaper cost  for them to set up and maintain that infrastructure of devices, browsers, operating systems, and viewport sizes. Given the cost of setting up and maintaining legacy cross browser tests, it makes sense that not a lot of companies use cross browser testing actively.</p>
<h3 id="h-willing-to-recommend-applitools-ultrafast-grid-for-cross-browser-testing">Willing to Recommend Applitools Ultrafast Grid for Cross Browser Testing</h3>
<p>Also, the survey asked participants their willingness to recommend Applitools Ultrafast Grid for Cross Browser testing. Here, 75% gave a 10 or 9 and got classified as promoters. Another 20% responded 7 or 8 and got classified as neutral. </p>
<p>The promoters valued:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed of tests – noting they could run their tests in the build process</li>
<li>Simplicity of management – no tests needed to be run and tuned across multiple plaforms</li>
<li>Simplified code management – fewer locators meant easier to set up and manage</li>
<li>More accurate – the underlying Visual AI wasn’t plagued by false positives and caught all the code errors</li>
</ul>
<p>The promoters discovered the ease of creating and maintaining cross browser tests using Applitools Ultrafast Grid. The promoters also realized that, with tests completed and analzyed accurately in well under 10 minutes, Applitools Ultrafast Grid made it possible to run cross browser tests in the scope of a build or during unit tests. Legacy tests, even when run in parallel, took tens of minutes to complete and analyze.</p>
<h2 id="h-implications-of-recommending-cross-browser-testing">Implications of Recommending Cross Browser Testing</h2>
<p>If you read my earlier posts, you know that two camps existed related to cross browser testing. One camp ran cross browser tests because they had encountered issues in the past and saw cross browser tests as a safe approach. The other camp avoided it altogether and thought cross browser testing unnecessary.</p>
<p>There is a third camp using Applitools Ultrafast Grid. This camp recognizes that the combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>test speed appropriate for software build processes</li>
<li>ease of deployment</li>
<li>lack of infrastructure to manage, and </li>
<li>simplified test code management, </li>
</ul>
<p>made cross browser testing feasible. This third camp can deploy Applitools Ultrafast Grid to run and validate rendering behavior for any combination of browser, operating system, and viewport size and run this test set quickly at the unit, build, merge, and final test timeframes. </p>
<p>What then are the implications for the Applitools Ultrafast Cross Browser Hackathon? 75% of the 208 engineers who completed both sets of tests could see the value of Applitools Ultrafast Grid just by using it. And, they would be willing to recommend it.  They realized that, whether they had previously released a bug to the field that they could have caught with cross browser testing, that Ultrafast Grid changed their understanding about this kind of testing completely.</p>
<p>Applitools users know that Applitools Visual AI makes it possible to run visual tests as part of their unit tests. These users can incorporate visual tests at every build and merge. And with Applitools Ultrafast Grid, they can incorporate cross browser tests as well.</p>
<p>Importantly, Hackathon participants learned these lessons just through their time on the Hackathon. </p>
<h2 id="h-what-these-recommendations-mean-for-you">What These Recommendations Mean For You</h2>
<p>When you have 75% of engineers recommending something, it might be worth trying. Whether you classify yourself as a cross browser skeptic or a grudging participant, it is clear that Applitools Ultrafast Grid offers something that differs from your current conception of cross browser testing. </p>
<p>At the very least, read the Applitools results in detail. You will learn why the engineers gave these recommendations.</p>
<p>More importantly, why not give Applitools a try? Sign up for a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.applitools.com/free/" rel="noreferrer noopener">free account</a>? Or, if you prefer, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.applitools.com/request-demo/" rel="noreferrer noopener">request a demo</a> from an Applitools representative. </p>
<h2 id="h-next-week">Next Week</h2>
<p>Next week, in my last blog post in this series, I will help you draw your own conclusions about Modern Cross Browser Testing.</p>

<p><strong>Apple and Google are under fire yet again</strong> for allowing scam apps into their curated app stores: Apple for permitting useless clone apps that sneakily charge recurring fees, and Google for not dealing with once-good apps that go rogue.</p>
<p><strong>There are no good app stores.</strong> There, I said it. Change my mind.</p>
<p><strong>It’s all about the mighty dollar.</strong> In this week’s <i><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/contributors/richi-jennings" rel="noopener">Security Blogwatch</a></i>, we follow the money.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://richi.uk/" rel="noopener nofollow" title="Richi Jennings">Your humble blogwatcher</a> curated these bloggy bits for your entertainment. Not to mention: <em>BOOM.</em></p>
<h3>A plague on both your houses</h3>
<p><strong>What’s the craic?</strong> Dan Goodin reports—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/android-barcode-scanner-with-10-million-downloads-infects-users/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Android barcode scanner with 10 million+ downloads infects users</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Barcode Scanner, one of dozens of such apps available in the official Google app repository, began its life as a legitimate offering. Then in late December … ads were opening out of nowhere. … An update delivered in December included code that was responsible for the bombardment.<br />…<br />Google [has] removed the app. … So far, however, Google has yet to use its Google Play Protect tool to remove the app from devices that had it installed. … Anyone who has a barcode scanner installed on an Android device should inspect it.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>How can we tell?</strong> Thomas Claburn explainifies—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/08/barcode_scan_app_malwarebytes_update/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Barcode scan app amassed millions of downloads before weird update</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Barcode Scanner, distributed by a London-based company called LavaBird, received an update on December 4, 2020, that appears to have introduced the code in question. … LavaBird&#8217;s now-banished Android app shouldn&#8217;t be confused with ZXing Team&#8217;s Barcode Scanner that remains in the Play Store.<br />…<br />LavaBird … is run by Dmytro Kizema, a resident of Ukraine. [It] was incorporated in March, 2020 [but] those involved appear to have been using variations on that name for several years and have other apps that they use to sell traffic to advertisers.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Who discovered it?</strong> Nathan Collier slightly over-hypes the scale of the problem—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/android/2021/02/barcode-scanner-app-on-google-play-infects-10-million-users-with-one-update/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Barcode Scanner app on Google Play infects 10 million users with one update</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Late last December we started getting a distress call. … One patron, who goes by username Anon00, discovered that it was coming from a long-time installed app, Barcode Scanner. An app that has 10,000,000+ installs from Google Play.<br />…<br />We predict … the update occurred on December 4th. … Malicious code had been added that was not in previous versions of the app. Furthermore, the added code used heavy obfuscation to avoid detection. … We confirmed it had been signed by the same digital certificate as previous clean versions.<br />…<br />It is frightening that with one update an app can turn malicious while going under the radar of Google Play Protect. … Because there are so many other legitimate barcode and QR scanners on Google Play, [here’s the] app information:<br />Publisher: LavaBird LTD<br />App Name: Barcode Scanner<br />MD5: A922F91BAF324FA07B3C40846EBBFE30<br />Package Name: com.qrcodescanner.barcodescanner.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>As opposed to other apps with the same name?</strong> Thus spake <i><a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/android-barcode-scanner-with-10-million-downloads-infects-users/?comments=1&amp;post=39646011#comment-39646011" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">marsilies</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>I use an app called &#8220;Barcode Scanner&#8221; that&#8217;s not the malware app. However, the recent reviews blast it for adware, which I haven&#8217;t noticed. I think having the exact same name has caused some people to post negative reviews on the wrong app.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>As wooped</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26063924" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">wooptoo</a></i>, too: <em>[You’re fired—Ed.]</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>This is possibly tied to the recent assault on the ZXing Barcode scanner app. This is a legit open source app that&#8217;s been recently flooded by 1-star reviews claiming that the app contains malware, probably in order to get users to switch to the other apps.</p>
<p>The funny thing is this app has not been updated since 2019 on the Play Store, so those reviews are clearly bogus. It takes a special kind of scum to slander an open source project in order to push malware.</p>
<p></em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>And this problem isn’t unique to Android.</strong> Tim Hardwick explains—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/scam-apps-ios-making-millions-revenue/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Scam iOS Apps Still Raking in Millions in Revenue on App Store</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>The problem of scam iOS apps has dogged Apple&#8217;s App Store for some years now. … Scammers prey on and exploit the work of genuine app developers. … The developer Kosta Eleftheriou has taken to Twitter to highlight that the problem remains as big as ever in at least some app categories – and also offered iOS users a way to spot them.<br />…<br />According to Eleftheriou, there are several clones of his … app, but one of the most clear non-functional rip-offs … launched with a blank interface and an &#8220;Unlock now&#8221; button. Tapping the button prompted users to confirm an $8/week subscription—for an app that doesn&#8217;t do anything.<br />…<br />[He said] the scam achieved prominence in the App Store by gaming Apple&#8217;s algorithmic ranking system through the purchase of fake ratings and glowing five-star reviews, which bumped it up to the top of its app category. It even advertised its software using his own promotional video.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Old news, I hear you cry?</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26069947" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">alex331</a></i> counts the days:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It&#8217;s been a week since this issue [was] highlighted. And a week since Apple still hasn&#8217;t said a single thing. This is sad.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>IANAL, and neither is</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=18218238&amp;cid=61041426" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Anubis IV</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Not a lawyer here, but it even seems as if there may be a case for fraud. … If they&#8217;re stealing someone else&#8217;s videos, posting them as their own, delivering a non-functioning app, and charging users $8/week for the privilege of using said app, the App Store might be well-served by Apple going after them in court.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Cui bono?</strong> With an eye on Apple’s 30%, <i><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26054879" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">ekurutepe</a></i> blames Tim Apple:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I&#8217;m sure Apple wants to do the right thing but they&#8217;ve set themselves up badly from the top down in this case: Tim Cook has been promising (and delivering) services revenue and subscriber count growth since 2016. If your employer says services revenue growth is the most important thing, people do respond to incentives even if they&#8217;re aware of it or not.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Meanwhile,</strong> what’s the best way to curate an app store? <i><a target="_blank" href="https://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=18208056&amp;cid=61036706" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">arglebargle_xiv</a></i> comment YOU:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Google method is much more economical. Google asks Google Play authors, &#8220;Are you Russian hacker?&#8221; and if reply is &#8220;Nyet!&#8221; then app gets approved.</em></p></blockquote>
<h3>The moral of the story?</h3>
<p>Watch out for scam clones of your app, and for bad reviews targeting similarly named apps.</p>
