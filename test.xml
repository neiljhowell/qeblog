					<description><![CDATA[As application development continues to evolve, the demand for teams to rapidly deliver software that can scale and evolve to meet customer]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>As application development continues to evolve, the demand for teams to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb/high-perf-continuous-delivery?lx=-DC2cJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">rapidly deliver software that can scale and evolve to meet customer needs</a> has never been higher. Front-end development frameworks are key to making that happen.</p>
<p>These frameworks are where the work for the layout, logic, and application is executed. These browser-based systems require JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and other web-standard technologies.</p>
<p>So how do you choose which framework is best for you? Here are the top five frameworks that development teams are using, based on my opinion and experiences, and what you need to know about them.</p>
<p><em>[ Learn best practices for <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/reduce-defects-software-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">reducing software defects </a><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/reduce-defects-software-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide</a>. Plus: Get the report <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/reduce-defects-software-tb/business-impact-production-defects?lx=HhQqWV&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Agile and DevOps Reduces Volume, Cost, and Impact of Production Defects&#8221;</a> ]</em></p>
<h3>Top front-end frameworks</h3>
<p>Web browsers all compete to have the best support for open standards such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is much less work needed to test if technologies work across different web browsers. The five frameworks you should consider are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Angular</li>
<li>React</li>
<li>Vue</li>
<li>Ember</li>
<li>Svelte</li>
</ul>
<p>The reviews that follow are based on my experience and that of my teams.<em> (I encourage you to leave any thoughts based on your own experiences in the comments below.)</em></p>
<h3>1. Angular</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://angular.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Angular</a> arguably has the most extended history of any on this list. Initially developed by Google in 2010, it was subsequently released as an open-source project. The framework consistently receives updates with significant releases typically delivered every six to nine months. The current major release is version 9.1. </p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<p>There is strong developer support for Angular. The documentation on the site supporting Angular development is excellent and, as a developer, you will find a lot of great how-to videos on YouTube to get you started.</p>
<p>Also, Angular continues to evolve and meet the needs of web developers. To this end, the framework supports the TypeScript language (a superset of JavaScript), a progressive web app architecture for multi-format solutions, and the M-V-C (model view controller) architecture.</p>
<p>Angular is also a critical component of the MEAN development stack consisting of MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular, and NodeJS.</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<p>Angular&#8217;s age can present a problem. In 2010, developers weren&#8217;t building mobile web apps, so for several years, additions were shoehorned into Angular to accommodate them. In 2016, Angular was rewritten with TypeScript and released as Angular 4. The original version, AngularJS, was renamed as Angular.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, previous versions of Angular aren&#8217;t compatible with the new TypeScript version in Angular 4. That&#8217;s important to know if any part of your organizations has used Angular and you&#8217;re thinking of going this direction for compatibility reasons.</p>
<h4>Bottom line</h4>
<p>Angular has grown and adapted to modern development needs. If you go this route, use the newer Angular 4 and later versions for building Angular apps. And be sure to keep a close eye on <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.angular.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the Angular blog</a> to keep up with the latest improvements to the framework.</p>
<p><em>[ Understand what your team needs to know to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com//l/software-test-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">take advantage of test automation</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide. Plus: Get the <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/software-test-automation-tb/buyers-guide-software-test-automation?lx=wYdl7c&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buyer&#8217;s Guide For Software Test Automation Tools</a> ]</em></p>
<h3>2. React</h3>
<p>Many development groups will choose either Angular or <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">React</a> as the base foundation for their web applications. The logic makes sense, and both are mature. Both deliver applications that can run massive web apps, and both have strong communities where developers can share information.</p>
<p>But where Angular went with TypeScript, React leverages JavaScript extensively. Facebook, along with individual contributors and other companies, maintain React.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<p>Some very large companies—including Facebook, Netflix, Dropbox, Airbnb, and Reddit—use React as their front-end framework. These sites receive millions of views per day. React has proved itself to be able to scale and meet the needs of the most demanding web apps.</p>
<p>Additionally, the skills you learn for React also apply to ReactNative, a framework that developers can use to build native applications that run on the iOS and Android mobile operating systems.</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<p>React is not easy to learn. The entire architecture is built in JavaScript, so you must be an experienced developer to start with React. </p>
<h4>Bottom line</h4>
<p>The learning curve with React is steep, but the result is a modular architecture that can support the most demanding websites. Facebook and the open-source community continue to invest in the growth of React, which ensures that investing in React will reward you for years into the future.</p>
<h3>3. Vue</h3>
<p>The selling point for <a target="_blank" href="https://vuejs.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Vue</a> is the size of the framework. At only 20KB, this is one of the most lightweight frameworks on the list. The inspiration for Vue came from work the original developer completed on Angular. In 2014, Vue was released as a slimmed-down alternative to Angular and has maintained a cult following ever since.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<p>Much like Angular, getting up to speed with Vue is not difficult. You can leverage your skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can also build templates and components in Vue, much as you would with ReactJS. </p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<p>Many developers rank Vue as a third-choice framework, behind Angular and React. To this end, the community supporting Vue is much smaller, and the development of the framework is not as robust as other, more popular frameworks.</p>
<h4>Bottom line</h4>
<p>Vue is an excellent alternative framework to learn and leverage as you need. It is a contending framework and could potentially be a smart alternative to Angular.</p>
<h3>4. Ember</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://emberjs.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ember</a> is one of the younger frameworks on this list. Released in 2011, its focus is on helping you build complex web applications. It offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>More productivity right out of the box when compared to others on this list</li>
<li>Stability without stagnation</li>
<li>Support for HTML5</li>
</ul>
<p>With these principles and continuous development, Ember is now in use for many large and popular applications, such as Apple Music, LinkedIn, and Square.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<p>The modular architecture and many hundreds of plugins make Ember a framework that gives you a lot right out of the starting gate. Also, solutions built with Ember can be converted into native applications such as Apple Music.</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<p>Ember leverages modules to extend the framework. The challenge as a developer is knowing which modules you should be using. Besides, there is a learning curve required to get started with Ember.</p>
<h4>Bottom line</h4>
<p>Ember is evolving quickly into a mature and stable alternative for building web apps and native apps when compared to React.Native and Angular.</p>
<h3>Svelte</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://svelte.dev/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Svelte</a> is the anti-framework framework. There are issues with some frameworks, such as a large codebase required to run scripts. Svelte, released in 2016, is driving the campaign to reduce the challenges of some traditional frameworks.</p>
<p>For instance, a simple <a target="_blank" href="http://svelte-todomvc.surge.sh/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">To Do MVP</a> application written with Svelte will weigh in at 3.6KB, whereas the same app written for React tops 45KB—10 times bigger. </p>
<p>Svelte can create tiny apps because of the model it uses for building applications. Other frameworks, included the ones listed above, rely on the web browser do the bulk of the work.</p>
<p>With Svelte, you write components with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, and then Svelte compiles the code into JavaScript modules. The result is that the browser does not have to do as much work. Which, in turn, means you can write more complex applications.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<p>JavaScript modules are an effective way of speeding up any JavaScript application. The approach Svelte brings is to increase the efficiency of your apps.</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<p>Many web developers have not worked with JavaScript modules. The whole approach Svelte offers is very different, and, because Svelte is the new kid on the block, the developer community is still growing.</p>
<h4>Bottom line</h4>
<p>Svelte offers an interesting approach to Web app development. There is merit in working with JavaScript modules, and the model Svelte offers is one that developers should experiment with. With that said, Svelte is thin on documentation. So, for the foreseeable future, treat Svelte as experimental.</p>
<h3>Go beyond web apps</h3>
<p>The focus of these frameworks is web apps, but that is no longer the world we live in. Back-end frameworks and accelerators also play a huge role in app development these days. (Those are topics go beyond the scope of this article, but need to be mentioned.)</p>
<p>Important accelerators include cloud, open-source tools, DevOps methodologies and security. But in many ways, the most critical accelerator is your mindset. As a modern developer, you must adopt a mindset of constant learning to continually improve the delivery model to meet the ever-increasing demands of your customers.</p>
<p>You must be able to effectively deliver solutions that can scale across all of the platforms your customers use. The combined power of front-end, back-end, and accelerators will give you the edge you need.</p>

<p>Visualizing objective, automated metrics makes them easier to understand. That&#8217;s why choosing <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/devops-metrics-matter-how-prove-business-value" rel="noopener noreferrer">the right DevOps metrics</a> is key. Here are six that have worked for my team at IBM, why they were chosen, and the improvements seen as a result. </p>
<p><em>[ Continuous delivery and release automation (CDRA) demands speed and quality.

<h3>1. Availability and uptime</h3>
<p>In the book <em><a target="_blank" href="https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/?gclid=CjwKCAjwztL2BRATEiwAvnALcrykM8BLlXoJ7tKFfTJhINzzpCjLRhZueNMjJqyHh3TV56qjfqZDjRoCi9gQAvD_BwE" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Accelerate</a></em>, by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nicolefv" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Nicole Forsgren</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jezhumble" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jez Humble</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/realgenekim" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gene Kim</a>, one of the four key software delivery metrics is &#8220;time to restore service.&#8221; Uptime is essentially a way to aggregate this metric over time.  </p>
<p>My team calculates availability by taking the total time of all outages reported by our primary production monitor for each service, subtracting that from the total time, and then dividing by the total time. </p>
<p>Our availability dashboard calculates this on demand for any date range. Most of our services have agreed to a service-level objective (SLO) of 99.95% uptime, with a few committing to 99.85% instead.</p>
<p>Our general manager reviews the uptime numbers for each of our production services quarterly. This motivates teams to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure their production monitors are accurately measuring the true end user experience</li>
<li>Focus on improving the availability of services that aren&#8217;t meeting their goals</li>
<li>Celebrate when they meet their SLO</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Work in progress</h3>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://global.toyota/en/company/vision-and-philosophy/production-system/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Toyota Production System</a> of lean manufacturing taught us that limiting work in progress (batch sizes) helps teams improve overall throughput. Put another way, it&#8217;s better to finish one project today than to chip away at 10 projects and finish none of them.</p>
<p>With our work-in-progress metric added to our dashboard, my team can simply count the number of open issues of each type (story, defect, task). When the number gets too high, it&#8217;s time to stop taking on new work and focus on what has already been started. That improves our overall velocity.</p>

<h3>3. Repository speed</h3>
<p>Pull requests represent value waiting to be delivered to production. The repository speed score is based on the time from submission to merge (i.e., review duration) of GitHub pull requests, over the last 30 days. A perfect score is given when the average time per pull request comes in at zero to two weekdays (M-F), decreasing to a score of zero at five weekdays.  </p>
<p>Old pull requests can get lost, affecting the repository speed metric. When you&#8217;re working with more than one repository, it&#8217;s difficult to keep track of outstanding pull requests.</p>
<p>One new feature shows where all outstanding pull requests for every repository the squad owns are shown, highlighting the ones that are old, and some squads review these in their daily stand-up. By highlighting old pull requests waiting for review, we ensure that our developers focus their code review efforts where they are needed.</p>
<p>Some developers frequently created pull requests before they were ready to deliver to production. Some of these requests stayed open for weeks, and that drove down our repository speed scores. </p>
<p>These long-running pull requests were used as a discussion point with other squads to clarify information that was missing in the specs. It was also a way for developers to communicate changes that would affect other squads.</p>
<p>Finally, this issue also highlighted a tight coupling between squads that my team wanted to avoid. The goal is for our squads to be autonomous but also loosely coupled to each other. The idea is to keep our microservice architecture very flexible, using APIs between the different services/squads. But when more than one squad began working on the same pull request, it highlighted an issue that seemed like an architecture/code ownership problem to us. If your APIs are well designed, you should be able to make changes at will, without affecting other squads.</p>
<p>After discussing best practices to improve this metric, squads were driven to experiment with pair programming, development on branches, API versioning, and contributing code across repositories.</p>
<h3>4. Deployment frequency</h3>
<p>Squads that deploy more than once per week can fix outages in production faster because they have the automation in place to deploy changes quickly and easily. They&#8217;re also delivering value to customers more frequently.</p>
<p>Finally, they&#8217;re more likely to fix newly reported critical security vulnerabilities within a few days because they don&#8217;t have to wait for the next scheduled deployment window or implement an &#8220;emergency change&#8221; procedure.</p>
<p>Our deployment frequency score is based on the number of successful deployments over the last 30 days, with color zero to one deployments red, two to three yellow, and four or more green.</p>
<p>Initially my team received pushback from teams that deliver code to production only every couple of weeks or, in some cases, only once per month. Deployment frequency is a key metric, and we were able to use the research from <em>Accelerate</em> to back up the importance of frequent deployments.  </p>
<h4>Promoting more frequent deployments</h4>
<p>To further encourage frequent deployments, teams were put on a weekly sprint cadence. And early on, we also had weekly playbacks. It quickly became clear which teams were delivering value every week and which were not. </p>
<p>Eventually, as the organization grew, my team settled into a pattern of biweekly playbacks so they could fit half of the teams each week into a one-hour session.</p>
<p>All of this led to conversations about how these teams might <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-deliver-speed-without-losing-your-customers" rel="noopener noreferrer">adopt continuous delivery</a>. In some cases, we&#8217;ve been able to sit with a team and get its CI/CD pipeline set up within a few days.</p>
<p>A red deployment frequency tile also shows us where the team needs to pull down the latest code and check for security vulnerabilities, and hopefully <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/how-automation-can-boost-your-security-compliance" rel="noopener noreferrer">automate that process</a> as well.</p>
<h3>5. Deployment stability</h3>
<p>Deployment stability is the percentage of time when the most recent build for a given repository was successful. On our scale, 0% to 50% is red, 50% to 90% is yellow, and 90% or higher is green. A developer on our team invented this metric after our developers complained that they were spending too much of their time fixing builds. </p>
<p>Broken builds can be a good thing, when <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-build-agile-friendly-test-automation-framework" rel="noopener noreferrer">excellent test automation</a> has stopped a poor-quality change from being delivered to production. Not all broken builds are due to code errors; sometimes there&#8217;s an infrastructure problem that needs to be fixed. Broken builds become a problem when they persist for a long time and start to interfere with developer productivity.</p>
<p>By visualizing broken builds over time on the dashboard, it&#8217;s obvious where squads need to spend some time <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/drowning-technical-debt-worse-youre-trapped-ponzi-scheme" rel="noopener noreferrer">cleaning up technical debt</a> and fixing the deployment process.</p>
<h3>6. SonarQube metrics</h3>
<p>Most of our repositories have integrated <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sonarqube.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SonarQube</a> reporting into their CI/CD processes, pulling the overall scores for security, code quality, and test coverage into our dashboard. They&#8217;re displayed at a repository level, squad level, and cross-platform level. </p>
<p>Making these scores visible helps teams ask for more time to improve their scores. My team has seen, for example, that one team improved its SonarQube security score from a D to an A in two days just by implementing the small changes SonarQube recommended.</p>
<p>My team is frequently challenged to defend our goal of 100% unit test coverage. Some teams believe they should get an &#8220;A&#8221; on the dashboard for a lower test coverage score, like 70%. My team stuck to our convictions here, and if a squad is happy with 70% coverage, then they can accept a lower grade.  </p>
<p>Others point out that it&#8217;s possible for teams to game the system by telling the code coverage checker to ignore large swathes of code. In reality, there has not been widespread abuse of code coverage &#8220;ignore&#8221; flags. Our developers and code reviewers should have the integrity to be honest about their code coverage.</p>
<h3>Understand your goal—and start slow</h3>
<p>Your goal should not be to make every tile on the dashboard turn green. You want to see where your squad is performing well and where there&#8217;s room to improve. Then you can make an informed decision as to where to invest time.</p>
<p>These six metrics are simple for people to visualize, and they have resulted in positive changes in my organization. But start out small and roll them out gradually as you explore how these metrics can help your own organization.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Let’s start with the good news. Agencies are adopting cloud services at an increased rate. Adoption has only increased in]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>Let’s start with the good news. Agencies are adopting cloud services at an increased rate. Adoption has only increased in times of coronavirus quarantine lockdowns with most federal, state and municipal workforce working from home. What’s even better news is that we also see increased adoption of cloud security tools, like CASB, which is commensurate with the expanding cloud footprint of US Public Sector agencies.</p>
<p>So now we have security tools in place to secure our cloud assets in SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. The next step is to determine what security controls need to be implemented. What DLP policies should the agency adopt? What capabilities of a cloud services should be enabled or disabled to maintain a robust security posture? How does an agency actually go about measuring the effectiveness of the security controls that were implemented? How do we find out how we stack up against our peer organizations?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, McAfee developed MVISION Cloud Security Advisor (CSA). Cloud Security Advisor is a portal that is provided “out-of-the-box” with your organization’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products/mvision-cloud.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">MVISION Cloud</a> CASB tenant. CSA provides a comprehensive set of recommendations for organizations to prioritize efforts in implementing their cloud security controls. The recommendations are broken down into Visibility and Control metrics. There is also a section that provides quarterly reports on various parameters, which we will discuss in a little bit.</p>
<p>When you first access Cloud Security Advisor dashboard you are presented with a “magic quadrant” that shows your organization’s security posture relative to other peer organizations on the scales of <strong>Control</strong> and <strong>Visibility</strong> and provides a <strong>maturity score</strong> for both.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-101805 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-1.png" alt="" width="936" height="472" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-1.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-1-300x151.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-1-768x387.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-1-205x103.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>There is even an option to select a vertical market to see how your organizations stacks up to organizations in other business sectors.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-101806 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-1.png" alt="" width="450" height="314" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-1.png 450w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-1-300x209.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-1-185x129.png 185w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"/></p>
<p>On the right of the main dashboard are check list items that provide a short description and current progress in following Cloud Security Advisor’s recommendations. CSA scans the organization’s MISION Cloud environment once every 24 hours. Any changes to MVISION Cloud will be reflected in the next scan. In the screenshot below, for example, we see an environment that is not enforcing controls on publicly shared links in Collaboration SaaS apps.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101807 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-1.png" alt="" width="936" height="404" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-1.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-1-300x129.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-1-768x331.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-1-205x88.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>From here, a security admin can simply click on the check list item and then on <strong>Enable Policy</strong>. This will automatically take the user to the DLP Policy Templates page to select the appropriate policy for enforcement.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101808 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1.png" alt="" width="936" height="472" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1-300x151.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1-768x387.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1-205x103.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>Another powerful capability of MVISION Cloud Security Advisor is providing quarterly Cloud Security Reports. These are accessible from the main CSA dashboard by going to <strong>View Reports </strong>and then selecting a quarter for which you would like to see the report.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101809 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5.png" alt="" width="936" height="274" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-300x88.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-768x225.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-205x60.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>From there we can start examining our organization’s cloud footprint to identify total number of Shadow IT services discovered that quarter as well as some additional Shadow IT statistics.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101810 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.png" alt="" width="936" height="352" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-300x113.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-768x289.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-205x77.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>Next we can look at IaaS resources in all our AWS, Azure and GCP environments.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101811 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7.png" alt="" width="936" height="318" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-300x102.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-768x261.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-205x70.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>We then proceed to look at summary statistics for DLP and access policy violations. Incidents show policy violations of each type detected across all of the organization’s cloud environments secured by MVISION Cloud CASB.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101812 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8.png" alt="" width="936" height="370" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-300x119.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-768x304.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-205x81.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>Next screen shows user behavioral anomalies and threats uncovered by MVISION Cloud UBA machine-learning engine.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101813 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.png" alt="" width="936" height="322" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-300x103.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-768x264.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-205x71.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>The Malware section of the report provides insights into malware uncovered in SaaS and IaaS environments connected to MVISION Cloud.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101814 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10.png" alt="" width="936" height="304" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10-300x97.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10-768x249.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10-205x67.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>The Data at Risk report is probably the most pertinent to gauging the effectiveness of the MVISION Cloud CASB solution. This report shows how much of the organization’s data was at risk and how it was secured using MVISION Cloud CASB. As seen from the image, there is a downward trend, indicating progress is being made to secure organization’s data. <img class="wp-image-101815 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/11.png" alt="" width="936" height="426" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/11.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/11-300x137.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/11-768x350.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/11-205x93.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>The Sensitive Data report shows how organization’s sensitive data is distributed across all cloud services in use by the organization. This report also provides insights into cloud adoption trends for your organization.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101816 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12.png" alt="" width="936" height="472" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12-300x151.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12-768x387.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12-205x103.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>The “Users” report is a pivot table of the Sensitive Data report that organizes incidents and policy violations by individual users. Ultimately, the report shows how much of a risk an organization’s users pose to organization’s data. <img class="wp-image-101817 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/13.png" alt="" width="936" height="388" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/13.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/13-300x124.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/13-768x318.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/13-205x85.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>The Mobile Devices report shows incidents for each type of detected mobile device.</p>

<p>The next three pages of the CSA report provide a deeper dive into the data on the front page of the CSA portal we saw in the beginning of this blog. On the <strong>Scores</strong> page we see the “magic quadrant” with <strong>Control</strong> and <strong>Visibility </strong>axis, together with progress relative to previous quarters. Visibility score and Control score, both on a scale of 100, gauge your organization’s maturity in securing its cloud footprint. <img class="wp-image-101819 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15.png" alt="" width="936" height="666" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15-300x213.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15-768x546.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15-181x129.png 181w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>Next, the Visibility metrics page. Visibility metrics measure how well an organization has been doing in gaining visibility into what is out there in their cloud environment and how secure it is.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101820 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/16.png" alt="" width="936" height="740" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/16.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/16-300x237.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/16-768x607.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/16-163x129.png 163w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>Finally, the Control metrics page shows how well an organization has performed in placing controls and mitigating security risks for its cloud environment.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-101821 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/17.png" alt="" width="936" height="472" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/17.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/17-300x151.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/17-768x387.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/17-205x103.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>And that, in a nutshell, is it. By reviewing the screenshots from the Cloud Security Advisor dashboard you should now have a good idea of the metrics at your disposal to quantify cloud security effectiveness for your organization.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In less than a week, the world changed. At the end of March, amid the throes of the coronavirus pandemic,]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>In less than a week, the world changed. At the end of March, amid the throes of the coronavirus pandemic, the vast majority of states in the US issued stay-at-home orders, resulting in the largest migration to remote working the nation has ever seen.</p>
<p>Before this happened, just <a target="_blank" href="https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">4% of workers spent the majority of their working hours outside the office</a>, and only 43% worked remotely with &#8220;some frequency.&#8221;</p>
<p>For security teams, the move caused chaos. Sensitive business resources that had, up to that point, only been accessed by workers at the office now had to be available to employees working from home. While many security experts had talked about the decline of the perimeter for more than a decade, the mass migration to remote working has forced every business to consider <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/pandemic-your-remote-workforce-9-ways-stay-secure" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to operate security with a distributed workforce</a>.</p>
<p>Many still are struggling to adjust, said Chase Cunningham, vice president and principal analyst for security and risk at Forrester Research.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen five years of innovation in three months. Companies are going to move toward this model, and it is up to them whether they work towards it now or continue to skate uphill by keeping everything inside the network.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/CynjaChaseC" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Chase Cunningham</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Zero trust,&#8221; the concept of operating securely with a distributed workforce and without a perimeter, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/how-zero-trust-approach-can-protect-your-cloud-resources" rel="noopener noreferrer">has become a necessity for most companies</a>. Not long ago, it was an aspirational model instead of a requirement.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/zero-trust-identity-access-management-tb/security-architecture-changes?lx=9nmHuO&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">why zero trust is so important now</a>, and how you can implement the model.</p>
<p><em>[ <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/zero-trust-security-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get up to speed on zero trust security</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s guide. Plus: Learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/zero-trust-identity-access-management-tb/conquering-the-authe?lx=9nmHuO&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to conquer zero trust authentication challenges</a> in this Webinar. ]</em></p>
<h3>Why zero trust is needed</h3>
<p>Surveys have found that anywhere from 70% to 85% of companies with remote workers intend to encourage them to continue to work from home even after stay-at-home orders expire. For instance, business research firm Gartner <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-04-03-gartner-cfo-survey-reveals-74-percent-of-orgs-to-shift-some-employees-to-remote-work-permanently" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">found that 74% of companies expect at least 5%</a> of their workforce who previously worked in an office to work from home in the future.</p>
<p>Still, the zero-trust model is not just about accommodating those workers. It is a <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-pandemic?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">foundational move in the digital transformation of the business</a>—efforts that were already underway before the pandemic, said Robert MacDonald, director of solutions at Micro Focus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The situation has accelerated the need to digitally transform the business to remove the traditional perimeter to be much more fluid, because people are working from everywhere, and they need access to that data regardless.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/macdonaldrobert/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Robert MacDonald</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For companies struggling with <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/key-bulletproof-security-zero-trust-networks" rel="noopener noreferrer">moving to the zero-trust model</a>, here are five recommendations from experts.</p>
<h3>1. Zero trust is no longer optional</h3>
<p>Moving the focus of security away from the perimeter is no longer an option. Aside from the realities imposed by the coronavirus pandemic and the uncertainty of whether in-office work will be possible on a consistent basis, many companies are looking at moving employees out of the office as a way to cut costs, reduce downtime due to commuting, and improve employees&#8217; work-life balance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been having lots of conversations about companies reducing how many people are coming to an office in a building,&#8221; Forrester&#8217;s Cunningham said. If they can cut their on-premises workforce by 25%, they can reduce costs significantly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;This is one of the few times in history where something that is really terrible can have a massive upside if we leverage carefully.&#8221;<br />—Chase Cunningham</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>[ Learn about <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/zero-trust-identity-access-management-tb/evolution-of-trusted-identities?lx=9nmHuO&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">the evolution of trusted identities</a> in this zero trust Webinar. ]</em></p>
<h3>2. Much of the technology is new</h3>
<p>Even just a few years ago, mature technology for implementing zero trust did not exist. While single sign-on vendors existed, the ability to manage corporate resources and access to those resources on a granular level had not advanced enough to scale to large deployments.</p>
<p>The US Department of Defense and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fedscoop.com/government-agency-embrace-identity-access-strengthen-cybersecurity-study/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">other federal agencies have pursued zero-trust principles</a> for more than a decade, with a variety of programs aimed at limiting access to data to only authorized parties, according to <a target="_blank" href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207-draft2.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a draft zero-trust architecture specification</a> from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p>
<p>When these programs were started, &#8220;they were limited by the technical capabilities of information systems,&#8221; NIST said in the draft. Security policies were largely static and, to get the largest effect for the effort, were enforced at large &#8220;choke points&#8221; that an enterprise could control.</p>
<p>As technology matures, it is becoming possible to continually analyze and evaluate access requests, dynamically and granularly, &#8220;to mitigate data exposure due to compromised accounts, attackers monitoring a network, and other threats,&#8221; the NIST document said.</p>
<h3>3. Don&#8217;t expect a single service or product to solve the problem</h3>
<p>Zero trust requires a large number of components to work together in an auditable and verifiable way. The seven basic tenets, according to the NIST specification, include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Designating all data sources and computing services as resources</li>
<li>Encrypting all communication end-to-end, no matter the location</li>
<li>Authorizing access to resources on a per-session basis</li>
<li>Allowing security and access policies to dynamically change based on context, state of the client, and current perceived risk </li>
<li>Monitoring all assets to be in the most secure state possible</li>
<li>Enforcing the temporary and dynamic nature of authentication and authorization</li>
<li>Maintaining visibility into the security of the entire network and business&#8217;s resources</li>
</ol>
<p>The interaction among all these requirements means that a single product or service is not going to be able to deliver a zero-trust architecture to a company, said Micro Focus&#8217;s MacDonald. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If a single company is saying that they will get you to zero trust, that&#8217;s nonsense.&#8221;<br />—Robert MacDonald</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>4. Identity and access management are crucial starting points</h3>
<p>The root cause of many breaches is the use of stolen credentials; it&#8217;s the second-most common threat action, <a target="_blank" href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/2020-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">according to Verizon&#8217;s 2020 Data Breach Investigations Report</a>. The most common threat action is phishing, which often also leads to credential compromise.</p>
<p>Almost every company that has suffered a breach has had antivirus software, a firewall, and maybe even an intrusion-prevention system in place, said Forrester&#8217;s Cunningham. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Where they fell down was with privilege and access control. If your identity or access store is compromised, that is when a breach can go on for days.&#8221;<br />—Chase Cunningham</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lesson is that managing identity and access is possibly the most important part of security, especially in a world of distributed employees, he said. </p>
<h3>5. Verify identity and authorization continuously</h3>
<p>Managing the initial authentication is not enough. Companies also need to re-authenticate users every time they access a different resource. With <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/state-authentication-its-time-move-passwords" rel="noopener noreferrer">technologies including adaptive authentication</a>, such checks do not have to be intrusive, but should be based on context, said Micro Focus&#8217; MacDonald.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If you only rely on the point of access, there is no check afterward. You want to constantly verify that the user assigned that identity is doing what you think they should be doing. If we just let them in and let them go, then we lose visibility into what actions they are taking on the network.&#8221;<br />—Robert MacDonald</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As companies adjust to &#8220;the new reality,&#8221; security remains a tough balance. However, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/toward-zero-trust-8-steps-boost-app-sec" rel="noopener noreferrer">pursuing a zero-trust architecture</a> can give companies flexibility in work arrangements, the security of continuous monitoring, and the ability to adapt to whatever the future holds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>In today’s online world, every digital experience is a reflection of your brand—which is why mobile application testing should be at the forefront of your testing strategy. </p>
<p>Whether it’s a picture of a check, a selfie, or a QR code, images can be uploaded to mobile apps for many reasons. Behind the scenes, the application has to do some amount of processing and storage. While creating those images might have been as simple as pointing and clicking for the user, testing image uploads themselves can be more challenging.</p>
<p>Before we dive into how to test image upload functionality, let’s quickly look at some common scenarios that require this type of testing.</p>
<h3><b>Common Use Cases</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/7JhrCi0CYMPZtsgoEVvipz/c98ccfed3daeb607652c09360bf71f23/QR_img2.png?fm=webp" alt="Scannable QR code" title="Scannable QR code"/></p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/2MwxZplM37IR0TqHvjJYmA/b58a137fec1cb9b068ff9816175d350f/Profile_img3.png?fm=webp" alt="Sample profile picture" title="Sample profile picture"/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Taking a picture and storing it in a gallery app</b> &#8211; Whether it’s a social media app or photo sharing, this use case can span many different types. In its simplest form, it could be taking pictures from the front or back cameras.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/6xXQBWV6M79mAPNpkYh8K4/675f2220aaeef0cc1dcf7a58f05f324b/Gallery_img4.png?fm=webp" alt="Sample image gallery" title="Sample image gallery"/></p>
<p>Regardless of the application, in order to ensure end users have a delightful experience, development teams need to have the ability to use the device camera for taking pictures so they can complete all testing scenarios. If you’re using a cloud service for mobile app testing, the devices will need to offer some type of Camera Image Injection feature.</p>
<h3><b>What is Camera Image Injection?</b></h3>
<p>Camera image injection gives developers the ability to inject images in their automation testing, so that specific test cases such as apps requiring scanning of QR codes or image scanners, can run on a cloud-based testing service as if it were on an actual device. This essentially provides the application with an image that mocks the use of the device camera. </p>
<h3><b>Testing on Sauce Labs Real Device Cloud</b></h3>
<p>To mimic camera behavior when testing applications on the <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/platform/real-device-cloud" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Device Cloud</a>, you need to provide the application with an image that mocks the use of the camera. Sauce enables this with the Camera Image Injection feature. Image injection takes an image (in either .<i>jpeg</i>, or .<i>jpg</i> format) that is stored locally and presents it to the application as if it was read by the device camera. Users can easily test this functionality manually via live testing or insert into their Appium test automation.</p>
<h4>Live Testing</h4>
<p>In this short video, you can see the uploaded image is used in the app as if the image was taken by the device camera.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/6TIA8Xe7et6hCLTrmcU3eP/9fa96acb4786786022db33c25b9f85ec/image-injection-steps-3-fast.gif" alt="Short video illustrating the steps to image injection" title="Short video illustrating the steps to image injection"/></p>
<h4>Appium Test Automation</h4>
<p>In your automated test script, you&#8217;ll need to input the desired capabilities specific to Camera Image Injection (<a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=102717708" rel="noopener noreferrer">see example code snippets here</a>) and incorporate the uploading of the images and opening of the camera.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start image injection by adding camera instrumentation desired capability command in your test script. Image injection is enabled by the desired capability sauceLabsImageInjectionEnabled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you reach the stage in your test session where you’d like to take an image with the app camera, add the image injection method in your test script. </p>
</li>
