<div>
<p>In this series, we are going to dive into some benefits and examples of a Test Automation Framework. A framework is an architecture of integrated parts. Some of those integrated parts are libraries, test data, and Page Object Model (POM). For <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/category/selenium/" rel="noopener">Selenium</a>, Data-Driven and Hybrid are two popular Test Automation Frameworks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data-Driven Framework – read values from a test source, then store the values in a test script.</li>
<li>Hybrid Framework – consists of two or more frameworks plus utilities, logs, reporting, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of this article, you will read about the <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#POMBenefits" rel="noopener">benefits of a POM</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#OpenSDKBenefits" rel="noopener">TestProject’s OpenSDK</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#LocatorBenefits" rel="noopener">Selenium Locators</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#JUnitBenefits" rel="noopener">JUnit 5</a>.</p>

<h2><a target="_blank" id="POMBenefits" rel="noopener"><strong>POM Test Automation Framework </strong><strong>Benefits</strong></h2>
<p>A Page Object Model is a design pattern with classes that represent each page of an application. It can also represent components within a page. For example, if an application has a Login Page then the Page Object may have a LoginPage class. After creating a Page Object class, each individual test script has access to the class. All test scripts are stored separately from the variables and methods. Here’s a screenshot that shows the Web Pages, Page Objects, and Test Scripts:</p>
<p></p>
<p><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16374 size-full" title="POM Test Automation Framework" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/15.1-Page-Object-Model.png" alt="POM Test Automation Framework" width="638" height="334" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/15.1-Page-Object-Model.png 638w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/15.1-Page-Object-Model-512x268.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px"/></noscript></p>
<p>The benefits of a Page Object Model are code readability, code reusability, and code maintainability. Code readability means the code is descriptive and easy to follow. Code reusability is a technique for reusing the same code in multiple locations. Code maintainability is an approach of taking less time to make a change to our code.</p>
<p>The results from a Page Object Model greatly outweighs a plain vanilla test. A vanilla test has everything like locators in each test script. Therefore, if a change happens in the Application Under Test (AUT), then each test script requires an update to its locator. This approach defeats the benefits of a Page Object Model such as code maintainability.</p>
<p>It’s time-consuming to update the locator in multiple test scripts. Can you imagine how long it would take if the AUT had more than one change? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f92f.png" alt="🤯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> That means each test script demands multiple updates for successful execution. However, the Page Object Model only requires an update in one place <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2><a target="_blank" id="OpenSDKBenefits" rel="noopener"><strong>Benefits of Using TestProject’s OpenSDK</strong></h2>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/advanced-scripting-capabilities/" rel="noopener">OpenSDK</a> from TestProject is a complete coding solution for Test Automation. It’s unified across multiple programming languages: Java, C#, and Python. One of the benefits is an extension of Selenium and Appium. The standard Selenium and Appium drivers are wrapped within TestProject’s powerful Agent that takes care of all the maintenance &amp; heavy-lifting for you, while extending Selenium and Appium with additional features, such as AI and automatic out-of-the-box reporting.</p>
<p>Selenium is designed for web testing while Appium is built for mobile testing. Therefore, the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/opensdk-v2" rel="noopener">TestProject OpenSDK</a> possesses the ability to test web and mobile applications. It’s comparable to getting the best of two worlds, plus additional features like API testing. A few more benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Docker</li>
<li>Support for RESTful API</li>
<li>Store and execute tests locally on any source control tool like Git</li>
<li>Test runner capabilities for local and remote execution</li>
<li>Automatic test reports in HTML/PDF format</li>
<li>Screenshots included in the test report</li>
<li>Reporting dashboard with execution history</li>
</ul>
<p>TestProject has several built-in <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/executive-test-reports/" rel="noopener">test report</a> dashboards (Velocity, Distribution, Platforms, Trends, Targets, Individual Run) and an API to get the report. We can manually create a test report or automate the report into our Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline. When it comes to logging, TestProject uses an SLF4J API. We can implement Log4j, Logback, or Java Logging to control the logging output. The following is a screenshot of <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/using-testproject-scripted-tests-within-ci-cd" rel="noopener">CI/CD using TestProject OpenSDK</a>:</p>

<h2><a target="_blank" id="LocatorBenefits" rel="noopener"><strong>Benefits of Selenium Locators (CSS Selectors vs XPath)</strong></h2>
<p>The purpose of a <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/11/13/optimized-selenium-selector-strategies-from-a-z/" rel="noopener">Selenium locator</a> is to help us find elements on a web page. An element is anything you see on the page such as buttons, text boxes, links, etc. The two most powerful Selenium locators are CSS Selector and XPath. CSS Selector finds an element by the CSS Selector’s engine. XPath finds an element by its XML Path. Both are powerful because they assist with finding all types of elements. In addition to CSS Selector and XPath, Selenium provides 6 more locators:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>className</strong></span> – finds an element by the value of its class attribute.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>id</strong> </span>– finds an element by the value of its id attribute.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>linkText</strong> </span>– finds a hyperlink element by its complete text.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>name</strong></span> – finds an element by the value of its name attribute.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>partialLinkText</strong> </span>– finds a hyperlink element by partial text contained within the complete text.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>tagName</strong> </span>– finds an element by its tag name.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the release of Selenium 4, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/13/selenium-4-relative-locators/" rel="noopener">Relative Locators</a> are added to the existing 6 locators to find elements based on the location of another element:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><u>above</u> </strong>– finds an element or elements located above a fixed element.</li>
<li><u><strong>below</strong> </u>– finds an element or elements located below a fixed element.</li>
<li><u><strong>near</strong> </u>– finds an element or elements located near a fixed element.</li>
<li><strong><u>toLeftOf </u></strong>– finds an element or elements located to the left of a fixed element.</li>
<li><strong><u>toRightOf </u></strong>– finds an element or elements located to the right of a fixed element.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although there are many Selenium locators, the benefit of using CSS Selector or XPath is their flexibility. They provide different options for finding an element. As a result, we can locate complex elements like dynamic elements. A dynamic element is an element with a continuously changing value upon reloading the web page. We can locate elements that start with a specific value, end with a specific value, contain a certain value, and many more complicated elements. The following are CSS Selector and XPath syntaxes that can also be downloaded via the below Cheat Sheet <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h2><a target="_blank" id="JUnitBenefits" rel="noopener"><strong>Benefits of JUnit 5</strong></h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/02/26/junit-5/" rel="noopener">JUnit</a> is a Unit Testing Framework that’s part of the Test Automation Framework. The goal is to provide a way for testing our code. According to the <a target="_blank" href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/index.html#user-guide" rel="noopener">User Guide</a>, JUnit 5 is unlike previous versions. JUnit 5 is composed of several different modules from 3 different sub-projects. The sub-projects are JUnit Platform, JUnit Jupiter, and JUnit Vintage:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><u>JUnit Platform</u></strong> serves as a foundation for launching testing frameworks on the JVM.</li>
<li><strong><u>JUnit Jupiter</u></strong> is the combination of the new programming model and extension model for writing tests and extensions.</li>
<li><strong><u>JUnit Vintage</u></strong> provides a test engine for running JUnit 3 and JUnit 4.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the benefits include code quality, debugging process, and locate defects early. Code quality impacts the overall quality of an application. Therefore, JUnit ensures the code is reliable and testable. The debugging process helps us detect and remove defects in our code. It is important because we can prevent unexpected or incorrect software operations. Last but not least, is locating defects early in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This benefit produces additional benefits such as reducing business risk, reducing cost, and improving application security. Eliminating a defect early is better than waiting for a problem to occur in production.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The COVID pandemic has not only altered the lives of millions of software professionals around the world, but it also]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>The COVID pandemic has not only altered the lives of millions of software professionals around the world, but it also has made many software companies think about various ways they can reduce costs and risks to preserve their production and exist in this highly competitive software industry.</p>
<p>It is a fact that now many companies have started to think about the different ways they can curtail their spending plans. But at the same time, they also have to ensure that their existing products and the new products that they are/will be launching in the market are of high quality, valuable to their clients/customers, and provide a great user experience. Thus they have to be cautious when it comes to Testing and <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener">Test Automation</a>.</p>
<p>One of the ways by which companies can reduce their costs significantly is by adopting Open Source technologies. If we talk about Test Automation, Open Source Test Automation Frameworks can come to the rescue. Costs involved in Test Automation can have many facets and we will discuss those later in this article. But first, let’s understand what we mean by “<strong>Open Source</strong>”.</p>
<h2><strong>What is Open Source software and how is it different from Proprietary ones?</strong></h2>
<p>If any software (tool/platform/technology/framework) is referred to as “<em>Open Source</em>”, it means that its source-code/blueprint/design can be accessed, used, inspected, reviewed, modified, and distributed by anyone with its original rights and licenses. The reasons can be many and may vary from enhancing its functionalities by adding features in it, fixing its bugs, or providing entirely new functionalities by creating wrappers around it. It will mostly be available free of charge <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f193.png" alt="🆓" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>On the other hand, if the software is “<em>Proprietary</em>” (or “<em>Commercial</em>”), it means that its source-code/blueprint/design is available only to the person(s)/organization(s) who have created it or own it. Only they can exclusively maintain, modify, and distribute it with its original rights and licenses. If anyone else (user/organization) wants to use that software, they usually need to sign a license agreement stating that they will not do anything with the software that its legal owner has not permitted.</p>
<h2><strong>Different ways Open Source Frameworks bring down Test Automation costs</strong></h2>
<p>With the widespread adoption of <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/11/18/waterfall-agile-scrum-kanban-methodologies/" rel="noopener">Agile</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/08/06/can-manual-testers-survive-in-the-age-of-devops/" rel="noopener">DevOps</a>, the benefits provided by Test Automation are undoubtedly numerous. I will not go into the details of those benefits as I am sure you are already aware of them from personal experiences or from reading different articles/blog posts. But like all other things related to software, Test Automation also involves costs from various aspects. The total cost can be a summation of the individual cost involved in the setup of the Test Automation Framework, its maintenance, its training/knowledge transfer, its enhancement, test execution time, test execution result interpretation, the infrastructure/environment in which the tests will run, and so on. Let’s discuss them and see how adopting open source frameworks can help in reducing test automation costs:</p>
<p><strong>1. Setup Cost</strong></p>
<p>If we go for a commercial tool for our Test Automation initiative, then there will be some license fee and subscription charge to start with. The subscription charge may be based on the number of users who will be using that product and for a defined timeframe (monthly/yearly). On the other hand, an Open Source Test Automation framework, which can consist of and provide the functionalities of popular open-source libraries like WebDriver, Appium, RestAssured, etc. out-of-the-box will not require any such charges (license/subscription). Even if the number of users who will be using the framework increases in the future, it will not have a direct correlation to the cost associated with the framework setup. The setup cost will be one-time unless there is a significant change required and a need arises to rewrite the majority of the core part of the framework.</p>
<p><strong>2. Maintenance Cost</strong></p>
<p>Most of the Test Automation Engineers around the world are already working or have worked on most of the open-source technologies which make up the Open Source Test Automation frameworks. So if your team comprises skilled Test Automation Engineers, then the cost of maintaining the framework, can significantly go down compared to any commercial tool. Maintenance means to ensure that the framework continues to be relevant to the testing of the product-under-test and can provide value by revealing problems.</p>
<p>Suppose, there is an issue in the framework itself. Then the resolution time can turn out to be quite less since, for open source technologies, the test automation engineers in the team can themselves solve the issue as they are already skilled in those technologies. If the issue is related to some core part of the framework and they are not able to solve it, then they can directly raise the issue with the maintainers of that framework or it is also possible that the issue might have already been encountered by someone else in some other part of the world and the solution has already been put in some collaboration platform like GitHub, StackOverflow.</p>
<p><strong>3. Training and Knowledge Transfer Cost</strong></p>
<p>For commercial tools, there will always be some associated training and knowledge transfer costs. The tool knowledge has to be cascaded from the people who are already using the tool or from the tool provider to the people who will be the users of that tool. Since there will be limited learning resources available in the public domain, the engineers in the team would need some time to get themselves accustomed and become proficient in that tool/framework. For Open source frameworks, this will not be the case since all or most of the required learning resources will be publicly available which means that learning and becoming proficient in them will be much easier.</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong><strong>Execution Result Interpretation Cost</strong></p>
<p>Whenever tests are run using a Test Automation tool or framework (be it open source or commercial), execution results get generated. The results can be in the form of simple stack traces, <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/executive-test-reports/" rel="noopener">useful reports</a> (HTML/PDF/JSON), logs, charts, and visualizations. Probably one of the most important aspects of Test Automation is the execution outcome in the form of generated results. A good clear detailed report/log can help the engineers quickly interpret and investigate the execution outcome which in turn can provide valuable insights on how the product is behaving under certain conditions.</p>
<p>In open-source frameworks, we can customize and tailor those generated execution results according to our needs, without spending any extra bucks to get those customized for us. Another benefit is that most of the open-source technologies which are created for reporting or monitoring purposes can be easily integrated with the Open Source automation frameworks and most of the time the integration processes (with step-by-step instructions) can be easily found on the net. Some tools also have <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/27/html-test-reports-for-selenium-and-appium-python-test-automation/" rel="noopener">out-of-the-box automatic test reports</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5. Infrastructure Cost</strong></p>
<p>When we talk about the infrastructure required for a successful Test Automation implementation, we refer to configuring and maintaining the automation setups like the platforms in which the tests will run, the browsers, the environments, the libraries which will help to run the tests, the monitoring and management tools, the evidence-capture and video-recording tools, the version control systems where the automation code will be maintained, the CI servers, etc. Multiple open-source technologies can be leveraged to meet these infrastructural needs like <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/" rel="noopener">Git</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-integrations/integration-with-jenkins" rel="noopener">Jenkins</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener">TestProject</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/05/30/the-ultimate-docker-tutorial-for-automation-testing-using-testproject/" rel="noopener">Docker</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://kubernetes.io/" rel="noopener">Kubernetes</a>, etc. and most of them are completely free or provide community versions that are free to use.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>More and more companies have started to embrace open-source technologies to deliver high-quality products to the market. This adoption is a result of the dedication of thousands of open-source contributors/maintainers and the continuous trust that open-source is providing in terms of control, ease of training/knowledge transfer, stability, and help from a large supportive community in addition to significant cost benefits to the business. Being an open-source enthusiast and seeing the recent trends in Test Automation, it looks clear to me that the popularity and usage index of open-source frameworks will continue to rise in the coming years <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>XDR (eXtended Detection and Response) is a cybersecurity acronym being used by most vendors today.  It is not a new strategy. It’s been around for a while but the journey for customers and vendors has been slow for many reasons. For McAfee, XDR has been integral to our vision, strategy and design philosophy that has guided our solution development for many years. Understanding our road to XDR can help your organization map your XDR journey.</p>
<h2><strong>The Building Pressure for XDR</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s start with why <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/security-awareness/endpoint/what-is-xdr.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">XDR</a>?  The cry for XDR reflects where cybersecurity is today with fragmented, cumbersome and ineffective security and where folks want to go.  In my CISO conversations it is well noted that security operation centers (SOC) are struggling.  Disjointed control points and disparate tools lead to ineffective security teams.  It allows adversaries to more easily move laterally across the infrastructure undetected and moving intentionally erratic to avoid detection.  Analysts only know this if they manually connect the thousand dots which is time consuming leaving the adversaries with ample dwell time to do damage. It’s no secret. There is a lack of security expertise, and these are regularly tested.  Their investigations are cumbersome, highly manual, and riddled with blind spots. It’s nearly impossible to prioritize efforts, leaving the SOC simply buried in reactive cycles and alert fatigue.  Bottom line—SOC metrics are getting worse—while adversaries are becoming more sophisticated and creative in carrying out their mission.</p>
<p>XDR has the potential to be a one-stop solution to alleviating these SOC issues and improving operational inefficiencies.</p>
<h2><strong>XDR Options</strong></h2>
<p>Many cybersecurity providers are trying to offer an XDR capability of some sort. They promise to provide visibility and control across all vectors, and offer more analysis, context and automation to obtain faster and better response when reacting to a threat. Point players are limited to expertise in their domain (endpoint or network) and can’t offer a critical, proven cross-portfolio platform. After all, can your endpoint platform offer true XDR functionality it it’s not also connected to network, cloud and web?</p>
<p>McAfee’s long-time mantra has been Better Together. That mantra underscores our commitment to deliver comprehensive security that works cohesively across all threat vectors – device, network, web and cloud and with non-McAfee products.  Industry analysts and customers agree that McAfee is well positioned to deliver a solid XDR offering given our platform strategy and portfolio.</p>
<h2><strong>There is more to the McAfee XDR Story</strong></h2>
<p>Now, what if you had that same comprehensive XDR capability that not only offered visibility and control across the vectors, but also allows you to get ahead of adversary and empowering you to be more proactive. It could give you a heads up on threats that are likely to attack you based on global and industry trends, based on what your local environment looks like. With this highly credible prediction comes the prescribed guidance on how to counter the threat before it hits you. Imagine it also supplies prescriptive actions you can take to protect your users, data, applications and devices spanning from device to cloud. Other XDR conversations can’t take the conversation to this level of proactivity. McAfee can in our recently announced <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/xdr.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">MVISION XDR.</a></p>
<p>Not only does McAfee take XDR to the next level, but it also helps you better mitigate cyber risk by enabling you to prioritize and focus on what most matters. What if your threat response was prioritized based on the impact to the organization? You need to understand what the attackers are targeting. How close are they to the most sensitive data based on the users and devices? MVISION XDR offers this context and data-awareness to focus your analysts on what counts. For example, threats that jeopardize sensitive data from a finance executive on his device will automatically be of priority versus a maybe threat on general purpose device with no data. This data-awareness is not noted well in other XDR conversations, but it is with recently announced MVISION XDR<strong><em>.  </em></strong></p>
<p>Let’s look at McAfee’s journey and investment with XDR and how we got to this exceptional XDR approach.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-115705" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.png" alt="" width="750" height="422" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.png 750w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-205x115.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/></p>
<h2><strong>McAfee XDR Journey</strong></h2>
<p>McAfee’s XDR Journey did not simply start up recently because a buzz word appeared that needed to spoke to.   As noted earlier, McAfee’s mantra “Together is Better” sets the stage for a unified security approach, which is core to the XDR promise.  McAfee recognized early on that multi-vendors security ecosystem is a key requirement to build a defense in depth security practice. OpenDXL the open-source community delivered the data exchange layer or the DXL message bus architecture. This enabled our diverse ecosystem of partners from threat intelligence platforms, to orchestration tools to use a common transport mechanism and information exchange protocol. Most enterprise security architectures will be a heterogenous mix of various security solutions. McAfee is one of the founding members of the <a target="_blank" href="https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open CyberSecurity Alliance (OCA)</a> where we contributed our DXL ontology – enabling participating vendors to not only communicate vital threat details but inform what to do to all connected multi-vendor security solutions.</p>
<p>Realizing EDR is network blind and SIEM is endpoint blind, we integrated McAfee EDR and SIEM.  McAfee continues to deliver XDR capabilities by bringing multiple telemetry sources on a platform from a single console for analytics and investigation, driving remediation decisions with automatic enforcement across the enterprise.  When you combine  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201029005036/en/McAfee-Introduces-MVISION-XDR-Industry-First-Proactive-Data-Aware" rel="noopener noreferrer">MVISION XDR</a> the first proactive, data-aware and open XDR and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201112005143/en/McAfee-Announces-MVISION-Marketplace-MVISION-API-Enable" rel="noopener noreferrer">released MVISION Marketplace and API</a> further supporting the open security ecosystem for XDR capabilities, organizations have a solid starting point to advance their visibility and control across their entire cyber infrastructure.</p>
<p>Before all the XDR hype, McAfee customers have been on the XDR path. Our customers have already gained XDR capabilities and are positioned to grow with more XDR capabilities. I encourage you to check out the video below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Digital transformation has been a complex endeavor since businesses first started going down this path, and it&#8217;s not getting any simpler. The technology landscape runs from mainframe to PC, from mobile to server, and from on-premises operations to the cloud, with most organizations running some combination of the above.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-pandemic?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener">Getting a handle on a digital transformation</a> today means trying to control as much of this as possible as you support the business’s broader goals of building new revenue streams, cutting costs, and minimizing overall risk.</p>
<p>While IT has traditionally been a cost center that helps in optimizing the business, in the new normal, CIOs must collaborate with the entire C-suite in order to move the business forward effectively, even if everyone has a different agenda. (And everyone always has a different agenda.) IT is no longer just about optimizing the business. It’s about delivering business.</p>
<p>To maximize the value of your digital transformation, focus on these four key areas.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Accelerate application delivery</strong></h3>
<p>It’s critical to be able to reliably scale agile and DevOps across all of your environments, from the mainframe to the cloud, while quickly <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb/high-perf-continuous-delivery?lx=-DC2cJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener">bringing innovations to life at the pace your business demands</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Simplify your IT transformation</strong></h3>
<p>By <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/hybrid-multicloud-management-tb/manage-cloud-complexity?lx=ooPdGt&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">simplifying the complexity of a hybrid IT environment</a> and unifying how you provision and manage it, you can transform into an agile, services-driven organization.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Strengthen your cyber resilience</strong></h3>
<p>Now more than ever, it&#8217;s critical to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cyber-resilience-tb/cyber-resilience-get-started?lx=dSbBFJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">intelligently adapt your security posture</a> to respond to an ever-evolving threat landscape and protect your company’s most important assets: its data.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Analyze in time to act</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, you need to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/ai-ops-transform-it-tb/aiops-enterprise-6-t?lx=my3YKV&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">leverage machine learning </a>in order to transform unlimited volumes of data into accurate, actionable, and automated insights that are useful to the business.</p>
<h3>Shared architecture is key</h3>
<p>All four of these pillars should be built with a shared architecture in mind. It’s essential to avoid implementing a jumble of disparate products, each of which is designed to tackle a single aspect of this strategy. Instead, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-value-stream-mapping-delivers-better-devops-toolchain" rel="noopener">implement tool chain components that work together </a>in a unified, cohesive manner.</p>
<p>Leverage common tools whenever possible, regardless of the underlying platform, and your teams should use them across functions, including strategic planning, development and operations, quality assurance, customer support, and security and governance.</p>
<h3>Your best option to get started: IT4IT</h3>
<p>This all sounds complex, but help is available, because this methodology and architecture has been standardized as part of <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-new-it4it-reference-architecture-game-changer" rel="noopener">the IT4IT Reference Architecture</a>, which lays out the groundwork of this implementation for you. The <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-interest-it4it-rise" rel="noopener">IT4IT standard is gaining traction</a> because it defines a comprehensive IT framework for delivering value to the business through key value streams—the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.opengroup.org/IT4IT/downloads" rel="nofollow noopener">standard has been downloaded</a> more than 10,000 times to date.</p>
<p>So how do you get started with this process, and what steps do you need to take to implement an IT4IT architecture foundation in your enterprise? The first step is to identify the stakeholders across your IT organization: the people who will be essential in implementing this strategy.</p>
<p>Then assess what systems currently exist in each of the functional buckets that serve as the backdrop to your architecture and ask which value streams are the most critical to standardize and improve. From there, the process is iterative. Determine which tools will meet your needs and implement them in iterations based on importance.</p>
<p>In several businesses we worked with, we created a visual map of all the tools the organization was using in order to paint a clear picture of its trouble spots and disconnects, and to develop an appropriate strategy for the business’s transformation.</p>
<p>For example, you can leverage IT4IT to solve <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/hybrid-multicloud-management-tb/ease-multi-cloud-management?lx=ooPdGt&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">hybrid IT management challenges</a>. You do this by leveraging a common tool set to manage a closed-loop incident process that uses predictive technology to automate your customer support requests, connecting your assurance, support, consumption, and fulfillment functional groups.</p>
<p>IT4IT can also <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/optimize-devops-tb/software-factory-devops?lx=vm26kZ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener">improve DevOps automation</a> by increasing service reliability, helping you to visualize, analyze, and maintain IT health through a feedback loop that connects assurance, support, consumption, quality, and development—while accelerating delivery through automated release and fulfillment systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With everyone aligned on a common set of tools, the business runs more efficiently and with a greater alignment to the business’s overall goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How my team consolidated tool chains</h3>
<p>My team adopted these strategies and processes after recognizing the challenges and limitations of our own disconnected tool chains. (In our software build group alone, we were using 96 different tools, mostly due to many acquisitions.) Because of this disconnect, our IT group was unable to effectively connect with customers or support them, because everything was buried in different tool chains.</p>
<p>Resources could not be reused across departments, and teams didn’t trust one another from one department to the next because their operational environments were so different. Without the IT4IT reference architecture, we didn’t have an effective way of <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/optimize-devops-tb/devops-scale-software-factory?lx=vm26kZ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener">building a digital factory that could deliver digital products effectively</a>.</p>
<p>IT4IT was designed to correct this type of issue, and it’s been dramatically successful in our own ecosystem. Now we’re working on the next iteration of IT4IT, and there’s more innovation coming in the generation of the standard. IT4IT gives you the freedom to re-architect and re-engineer your existing processes—and best of all, it does so in a vendor-agnostic way, so you can freely move any element of your architecture from one vendor to another as needed.</p>
