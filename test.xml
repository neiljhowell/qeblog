										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>APIs are an important interface in the modern computing world, where an increasing amount of applications and sites are hosted on online cloud platforms. APIs allow for communication between different applications which are built on service-oriented architectures, many different companies use the public API approach to share and make their tool more accessible to various users from external sources. Of course, all these APIs must be tested to ensure their functionality and usability, despite lacking a graphical interface and requiring a more programmatical approach, which can make the API testing flows more challenging and intimidating.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/the-ultimate-postman-tutorial-for-api-testing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postman</a> is the #1 tool when it comes to testing your APIs manually, but when it comes to API automation, scheduling and reporting as part of end to end API testing flows, it becomes more challenging.</p>
<p>End-to-end API testing flows can involve multiple input sources, such as HTML, Databases, Telnet/SSH, Mobile, Shell, Data files, other RESTful APIs and more. <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a>‘s test automation platform allows not only testing your APIs manually, but also to complete end-to-end API based test automation flows, schedule and run them periodically, get execution reports and all of that without any third party tools and without a single line of code <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>This hands-on tutorial consists of step-by-step examples and real automated test flows, shared here for you to use and practice while automating your APIs.</p>

<h2>Among Us – one of the Most Popular Online Game of 2020</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-110920" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Among-Us-pic-1-300x175.jpg" alt="" width="447" height="261" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Among-Us-pic-1-300x175.jpg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Among-Us-pic-1-1024x598.jpg 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Among-Us-pic-1-768x448.jpg 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Among-Us-pic-1-205x120.jpg 205w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Among-Us-pic-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px"/></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(pictured credit: axel 795, Pixabay)</span></p>
<p>If you have teens and you haven’t yet heard of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.innersloth.com/gameAmongUs.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Among Us’</a> then I guarantee it won’t be long. Among Us is an online deception and strategy game that is having a real moment worldwide. Over the last six months, it has amassed 85 million players on both PC and mobile. In September, it broke the all-time record-setting peak player ceiling on <a target="_blank" href="https://steamcharts.com/app/945360" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> when nearly 400,000 people played it simultaneously and, Google Trends reports that there were 50 times more Google searches for it at the beginning of October, as compared to the beginning of August.</p>
<h3><strong>What’s The Game About?</strong></h3>
<p>Among Us is an online multi-player game that is set on a failing spaceship. Suitable for up to 10 players, it has been compared to ‘Murder in the Dark’ or ‘Murder Wink’ – the old-school party game you may have played as children.</p>
<p>At the start of the game, you’re advised whether you are a regular crew member or an imposter. Crew mates are tasked with completing small tasks that benefit the spaceship eg cleaning our air-conditioning ducts whereas imposters (between 1-3 players) create havoc on the spaceship and seek out victims to kill – without letting anyone know.</p>
<p>Every time a dead body is found, a crewmember will call a meeting to workshop who they think the imposter is. This is one of the few times players can talk to each other. As you can imagine, this can get very heated (and entertaining) as players try to implicate others and remove themselves from focus. All players then vote on who they think the imposter is – and the player with the most votes is ejected from the spaceship’s airlock.</p>
<p>Crewmates win by managing to repair the ship and eject all the imposters while the imposter wins by killing all the crewmates before they complete their jobs.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Has It Become So Popular?</strong></h3>
<p>Among Us was actually launched in 2018 but to little fanfare. But the planets have aligned for the developers at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.innersloth.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">InnerSloth</a> and it has become one of the biggest online games ever. In fact, it’s so successful that the developers have abandoned plans for a sequel and are instead, investing their resources into perfecting the original.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that pandemic life has contributed to the popularity of Among Us with many touting it as the ultimate group party game. In fact, some believe it brings all the energy and pizazz of board game night – just virtually.</p>
<p>It is extremely easy to learn. So, if you aren’t a gamer with years of experience (that’s me) you can absolutely play. This concept has been described by popular YouTube gamer <a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/Pegasus" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pegasus</a> as ‘ingenious’ for its simplicity, and praised for its ‘extremely social’ nature.</p>
<p>The game is also very well priced. In fact, it’s free on mobile – but you will have to view some ads. And it’s only around $7 on a PC – so much cheaper than anything my kids have played in years!</p>
<h3><strong>What Parents Are Asking</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Is it Suitable?</strong></h4>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/among-us-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Classification Board here is Australia gives Among Us a PG rating</a> which means the content is mild in impact. But they do state that PG rated content is ‘not recommended for viewing by people under the age of 15 without guidance from parents, teachers or guardians.’</p>
<p>In Australia, the game is rated as suitable for 9+ on the App Store. On Google Play it is nominated as suitable for ages 10+.</p>
<p>The role of the imposter in the game to hunt and murder players is aggressive and violent. Yes, it is a cartoon-like visual which does reduce the impact but there are still bodies left lying around after the deed is done.</p>
<p>Parents know their children the best. Absolutely take heed of the advice, but ultimately, you need to decide what’s suitable for them. If you do decide to let your younger children play – or they’ve already discovered it – please talk about violence in video games. Does watching violent images make them feel scared or more aggressive? Do they feel better if they talk about it or, in fact, choose to watch something less violent?</p>
<h4><strong>Can They Chat With Strangers During The Game?</strong></h4>
<p>There is opportunity to chat with strangers in the game but it is less than most online games. Players can chat in the online waiting room before a game starts and of course, there is also interaction in the meetings during which the group tries to work out who the imposter is. Enabling the censor chat mode is a good option here – this limits word and aims to block out expletives however I understand that isn’t completely fool proof.</p>
<p>But you can choose to play the game offline, locally, which means you play only with people you know. You simply share a generated code with the players you want to join the game. I highly recommend this for younger children and teens or if you want to play the game as a family. The game can be played with as few as four players which makes an offline game far easier to get happening.</p>
<h4><strong>Does It Share A Positive Message?</strong></h4>
<p>Both trust and deceit are at the core of this game. Learning who to place your trust in is part of being a successful crewmember in Among Us whilst being a master of deceit will win you the game as an imposter.</p>
<p>You could argue that these themes are no different to playing Murder in the Dark or even the old classic Cluedo. However, I would absolutely have a conversation with your kids about the difference between real life and online (or gaming) life. Why not weave it into your dinnertime conversation?</p>
<p>My boys are really enjoying playing Among Us, in fact – we have earmarked this weekend for a family game. But please ensure you are comfortable with the game before you give your kids the green light. And if you do, be assured that one of the reasons this game is so popular is because players feel like they are part of a community – and isn’t that what we all need at the moment?</p>
<p>‘till next time.</p>

<br /></p>
<div>
<p>For organizations getting ready to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cyber-resilience-tb/state-secops-beyond-soc?lx=dSbBFJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">move beyond Security Operations with their security approach and improve the cyber resiliency of their systems</a>, some excellent startup tools exist. And, equally important, best practices are emerging.</p>
<p>One of the best places to start your resilience journey is with a cyber-resilience framework. They help an organization establish the goals and objectives for its resiliency strategy, as well as identify specific technologies needed to control, manage, and recover from cyber attacks.</p>
<p>By using a framework, an organization can craft a cost-effective, flexible, prioritized, and performance-based path to cyber resilience. A framework can also help an enterprise assess its current security stance and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cyber-resilience-tb/cyber-resilience-assessment?lx=dSbBFJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">identify areas for needed improvement</a>. As improvements are made, the framework can also be used to assess the progress of a resilience program.</p>
<p>There are a number of popular frameworks, but they all share some common elements. Here&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cyber-resilience-tb/cyber-resilience-get-started?lx=dSbBFJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">what you need to know about them</a>—followed by best practices for cyber resilience.</p>
<h2>Assess the risks</h2>
<p>An organization-wide assessment should be performed to identify all cybersecurity risks to the systems, assets, data, people, and capabilities of the enterprise. Important items covered by the assessment should include what the organization&#8217;s risk management strategy should look like; which cyber risks operations, individuals, and assets in the organization are facing; and what assets the organization uses to accomplish its mission.</p>
<p>When planning for risk management and resilience, organizations should be careful not to over-engineer their schemes, George Platsis, director of cybersecurity for FTI Consulting, <a target="_blank" href="http://securityintelligence.com/articles/creating-roadmap-toward-cyber-resilience/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">wrote recently</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It is a crude metaphor, but managing your cyber risk increasingly becomes more like managing your investment portfolio. It is tailored to you and your expectations. But if you are not on top of what’s going on, increasing complexity could lead to increasing volatility. That means your current and future outlooks could quickly be thrown into jeopardy.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/gplatsis" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">George Platsis</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;More importantly,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;if you are hoping to maximize business efficiency in your operations using this new gadgetry, then you may be setting yourself up for a colossal loss on the downturn, or a massive data breach that is nearly impossible to recover from could occur.</p>
<p>Indeed, IBM&#8217;s annual cyber-resiliency <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-45839&amp;_ga=2.1023858.255029181.1595266313-545301124.1591239208&amp;cm_mc_uid=78530529166215859305703&amp;cm_mc_sid_50200000=83358031595266312380" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">report</a> for 2020 noted that an excessive use of disconnected tools creates complex environments, which can have an adverse effect on an organization&#8217;s ability to detect, prevent, contain, and respond to a cybersecurity incident.</p>
<h2>Tally up your resources</h2>
<p>In addition to assessing risks, it&#8217;s also important to take a tally of resources—both technological and human. Such an analysis may reveal areas where automation or a managed service provider may be useful. Of course, nowadays it&#8217;s necessary to consider privacy issues when evaluating both present and future resources, especially when it comes to monitoring data or storing too much of it for too long.</p>
<p>Another typical recommendation is to develop and implement safeguards to make sure critical services will be delivered successfully. Those safeguards usually include controls to ensure entities have access only to resources needed to do their jobs or functions. They also include security education, which has become increasingly important as more and more employees are forced to work at home, noted James McQuiggan, a security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, a security awareness training provider.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;With COVID-19 and the increased number of people working from home, organizations&#8217; senior management recognize that the employees are being targeted more than before and require additional training to increase their knowledge of various cyber attacks.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/James_McQuiggan" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">James McQuiggan</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Development of activities and actions to identify a risk event quickly is also a common framework recommendation. Organizations need to clearly define the roles and responsibilities in play when a suspicious event is identified. They also should be monitoring their assets and networks for potential cyber risks and anomalies.</p>
<p>After risk events are detected, a response is in order. Frameworks typically recommend that enterprises have response procedures in place, that shareholders within the enterprise coordinate their response to the event, and that action be taken to prevent the event from continuing and spreading.</p>
<p>IBM says that having a cybersecurity incident response plan (CSIRP) is an important component of any resiliency strategy. It cautions, however, that the plans have to be reviewed frequently. &#8220;As the volume and severity of attacks increase year after year, the lack of an updated CSIRP may increase the risk of experiencing a significant disruption to IT and business processes,&#8221; it noted in its 2020 report.</p>
<p>Recovery is also a common characteristic among frameworks. Recommendations in that area involve restoring any damage from a cyber attack and conducting post-mortems to assess what can be learned from the incident to improve resiliency.</p>
<h2>Best practices</h2>
<p>In addition to following a framework, organizations can also follow these five best practices to improve the resilience of their operations.</p>
<h4>1. Tailor your response plans to attacks specific to your industry</h4>
<p>Not only does that save time and money that would have been spent on low-risk threats, but it allows for more detailed planning for real threats.</p>
<h4>2. Increase visibility and reduce complexity by embracing interoperability</h4>
<p>Using tools that are interoperable increases the effectiveness of security teams by helping them more quickly detect and block attacks.</p>
<h4>3. Invest in technologies to accelerate incident response</h4>
<p>Automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud services are some of the leading ways to increase cyber resiliency. Automation can improve not only operational efficiencies, but also the morale of security teams, which will be able to focus their talents on more meaningful activity and be freed of &#8220;scut work.&#8221;</p>
<h4>4. Bring your security and privacy teams together before serious events occur</h4>
<p>IBM found that companies that exhibited strong cyber-resiliency characteristics recognized the important relationship between these teams. Encouraging collaboration between the teams will improve responsiveness to incidents such as data breaches much more so than if the first time groups collaborate is when they&#8217;re thrown together to face a crisis.</p>
<h4>5. Get the company brass on board</h4>
<p>In all organizations, something is more likely to gain traction if it gets buy-in from the executive team. One way to get the attention of C-level executives and board members is to formalize resiliency reporting to them. That way, resiliency can be kept visible to the upper ranks and receive the resources it needs to preserve the revenues and reputation of the organization.</p>
<h3>Take your SecOps to the next level</h3>
<p>Stan Wisseman, chief security strategist at Micro Focus, said the key is to build on the existing tools and best practices to take your security operations to the next level.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some great guidance out there. There&#8217;s a lot of good work that has already been done to help organizations evolve beyond just cybersecurity.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanwisseman/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stan Wisseman</a></p>

<div>
<p>Agile methodology should be a seamless setup where anytime, tracking of tests per requirement or story, automated or manual tests executed and results available for monitoring or auditing by key stakeholders. And, automation execution shouldn’t be something only techies can do. Non-technical people in the team should know what is being covered in automated tests for stories.</p>
<p>Mature organizations with agile methodologies, implement tooling to centralize, testing, requirements, defects and reporting at one place for better tracking and also to make informed decisions on the software quality management process.</p>
<p>Recently, I have come across two tools, <strong>qTest </strong>and <strong>Applitools </strong>– integrating them in the agile process will solve above challenges and makes testing practise in an agile environment – transparent, traceable, measurable and efficient.</p>

<h2 id="h.5jgitecfokqa"> qTest</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tricentis.com/products/agile-dev-testing-qtest/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tricentis qTest</a> offers a suite of Agile testing tools designed to improve efficiency and ensure collaboration on your journey to release the best software.</p>
<p>qTest has below components to support agile testing methodologies,</p>
<ul>
<li>qTest Manager – Powerful and Easy-to-Use Test Case Management</li>
<li>qTest Launch – Centrally Manage Open Source Frameworks &amp; Commercial Test Automation Tools</li>
<li>qTest Explorer – Test Execution Recorder &amp; Documentation Tools</li>
</ul>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools </a>Visual AI, provides the software industry’s only AI-powered, deep learning, computer vision engine that replicates the human eyes and brain to test rendered components and pages.</p>
<p>Applitools offers incredible efficiency. A single line of capture can replace dozens of text-based assertions per test.  With Applitools, you create tests faster, and you execute tests in seconds on multiple devices/browser combinations. Applitools helps you ensure perfection across all browsers, screens and viewports. You can even include web accessibility compliance testing at the same time.</p>
<p>Applitools has 40+ SDKs for different programming languages and test runners, covering web apps, mobile apps, screenshot testing, PDF validations, and more.</p>
<h2 id="h.piqab7od5109">Applitools Integration with qTest</h2>
<p>How do we combine visual AI in Applitools with Test management capabilities in qTest to make software testing efficient in Agile methodology?</p>
<p>Common flow of test management in any agile environment is,</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing tests to user stories/requirements.</li>
<li>Execute tests manually or automatically.</li>
<li>Raise defects</li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I’m focussing on the automated tests to explain the benefits of qTest and Applitools integration.</p>
<p>qTest supports multiple test runners like TestNG, Cucumber, JBehave, JUnit, NUnit, MSTest etc that can be used with popular tools like Selenium to run automated tests.</p>
<p>Integrating Applitools with the automation tools and test runners is straightforward. Follow <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tutorials</a>  for a step-by-step guide</p>
<p>I have chosen, Cucumber-Java-Selenium and Applitools combination to explain integration.</p>
<p>Cucumber is most commonly used in agile development for writing automated tests.</p>
<p>Cucumber is a BDD(Behavior-Driven Development) software tool which helps facilitate the use of an easy-to-learn language called Gherkin. The Gherkin language is used for writing user stories in a ubiquitous language which can also be parsed by the test runner software. For details of Cucumber and Gherkin language, please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://cucumber.io/docs" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cucumber.io/docs</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a sample Cucumber scenario, as shown below to launch Tricentis website.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Feature: Browser Test
  Scenario: Search qTest Launch
      Given I am on the Tricentis website
      When I search for “qTest Launch”
      Then I should see qTest Launch item on the Search page</pre>
<p>Applitools should be added to the implementation of the Cucumber steps. If the automation framework uses a page object model then Applitools should be added to page objects.</p>
<p>Applitools requires a Selenium webdriver object to capture a screenshot of the application under test.</p>
<p>The following line of code should be added before capturing the DOM screenshot.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">eyes.open(driver, “Demo App”, “Smoke Test”, new RectangleSize(800, 800));</pre>
<p>Next is to add the Applitools check command to take a full-page screenshot.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">// Visual checkpoint #1 - Check the login page.<br/>eyes.checkWindow(“Login Window”);</pre>
<p>**Please refer to this <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/selenium-java.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorial </a>for the remaining steps and completing the integration.</p>
<p>We have successfully added Applitools code to automated tests.</p>
<h2 id="h-running-tests">Running Tests</h2>
<p>Let’s run the automated tests with qTest Launch or CI/CD tools like <strong>Jenkins</strong>.</p>
<p>Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://documentation.tricentis.com/qtest/9910/en/content/qtest_launch/launch_user_guides/qtest_launch_quick_start_guide.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">qTest Launch</a> for more details.</p>
<p>During the test execution, Applitools takes DOM snapshots of the application under test (as shown below) and sends the snapshot to Applitools server for comparison with visual AI – emulating the human eye and brain.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>
<p>Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools</a> for more details.</p>
<p>So far, we have prepared tests and integrated Applitools and now let’s see the results of integration.</p>
<p>qTest automatically imports automation results to qTest Manager dashboard if tests are executed by qTest Launch. Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://documentation.tricentis.com/qtest/od/en/content/qtest_launch/universal_agent_user_guides/universal_agent_overview.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">qTest Launch</a>  for more details.</p>
<p>For execution in Jenkins refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tricentis.com/academy/ondemand-training/how-to-integrate-qtest-jenkins-pipeline-projects/" rel="noopener noreferrer">qTest integrations with Jenkins</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into results imported into qTest Manager as shown below.</p>
<p>Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://documentation.tricentis.com/qtest/od/en/content/qtest_manager/introduction/qtest_manager_quick_start_guides.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">qTest Manager </a>for more details.</p>

<p>qTest Manager dashboard with automation run results.</p>
<p>As shown in the above screenshot, tests are marked passed or failed.</p>
<p>Integrating qTest with Applitools, the advantage is, <strong>qTest marks the test passed or failed depending on the status from Applitools.</strong></p>
<p>Applitools has different status of tests, based on the comparison done by Visual AI.</p>
<p>Please refer to this <a target="_blank" href="https://help.applitools.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007188251-Different-statuses-of-tests-and-steps#:~:text=Unresolved%2D%20A%20test%20which%20has,have%20not%20yet%20been%20reviewed." rel="noopener noreferrer">article </a>for more details.</p>
<p>Let’s click on the test executed and see the details of the execution in both pass and failure scenarios,  </p>
<p><strong>Passed</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>qTest marks the test as <strong>Passed </strong>as Applitools have a taken full-page screenshot of the application and no differences observed with baseline snapshot of the same screen.</li>
<li>Applitools has tested a full-page emulating human eye.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Failed</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>qTest marks the test as <strong>Failed </strong>as Applitools have taken a full-page screenshot of the application and observed differences with the baseline snapshot of the same screen.</li>
<li>Applitools has tested a full-page <strong>emulating human eye </strong>and has found differences that a human eye would visualise by comparing text, images, colour, and contrast.</li>

<p>To know more about Applitools capabilities for testing <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/web-testing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">websites</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/adding-app-visual-management-to-mobile-test/" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile applications</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/3-steps-visual-testing-pdf/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF </a>documents. Please follow the links.</p>
<p>So far, we have achieved below in agile testing practise with integration,</p>
<ul>
<li>Tests are written for user stories</li>
<li>Automated tests are linked to stories</li>
<li>Results have been centralised in one place</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, all the stakeholders, team members should be able to,</p>
<ul>
<li>See the progress of given user story testing</li>
<li>Understand what is been tested in automated testing</li>
<li>See the current state of application</li>
<li>Collaborate and take informed decisions</li>
</ul>
<p>Results are available all time in one place for future reference or auditing purposes, giving agile teams transparency and the ability to trace, measure and increase their efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="h.qpf8blko7i92">Benefits of Integration</h2>
<p>In broader terms, Applitools compliments teams using qTest or any other automation tools to,</p>
<ul>
<li>Test faster with less code or zero code – productivity gain by 70%</li>
<li>Cross Browser testing with no infrastructure cost – coverage increase by 90%</li>
<li>Automation results combined at one place – standardising tools</li>
<li>Fewer defects to production – bugs caught 45% more with Visual AI</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope you liked this blog. Keep Testing!</p>

<div>
<p>You have decided to add the power of Selenium <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/resources/white-papers/core-elements-of-continuous-testing" rel="noopener noreferrer">automated testing</a> to your testing strategy, but are overwhelmed with how much learning is involved. The Selenium automation framework can be intimidating, and getting started with little to no experience can be a massive undertaking for any organization. The good news is that there is a great way to get started with automated functional testing and it’s not what you would expect: <b>visual testing</b>! </p>
<h3><b>Automated Functional Testing With Visual Testing </b></h3>
<p>In this post, I&#8217;ll take you through how you can use visual testing to detect visual regressions and as a bonus, get automated functional testing out of it too. </p>
<p><b>Prerequisites: </b><a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/platform/visual-testing" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sauce Visual</a><b>, </b><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/screener-io/screener-runner" rel="noopener noreferrer">Screener Runner,</a><b> and Javascript</b></p>
<p>In order to get started, you’ll need the Screener Runner Javascript package and Sauce Visual. I’ll share how using Sauce Visual, our visual testing solution for detecting and reviewing visual changes, can be used to automate visual and functional testing.</p>
<p>We’ll use the interaction testing capabilities provided in the Screener Runner package to perform functional testing, pared-down similar to what Selenium provides.</p>
<div class="image"><picture><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/2wPHATqatrLgz1HSyW4V5h/2e669c5c8ba3421f36b521f066bbbf2f/screener_dashboard.png?fm=webp" type="image/webp"/></picture></div>
<h3><b>Interaction Testing </b></h3>
<p>Screener Runner Interactions can be used for clicking buttons, hovering over elements, setting values, and entering text, which are all used to ensure your components or pages are in their proper visual state for the test. Functional testing through Screener Runner’s Interaction library is useful for testing full web pages, individual components, and complete end-to-end flows.</p>
<p>To use interactions and create your functional tests, Screener Runner provides an API  called Steps. Each Step is an instruction to interact with the website. To see all available Steps, check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/screener-io/screener-runner#testing-interactions" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repo</a>. </p>
<p><b>Example 1: Using screener-runner to capture snapshots of a website</b></p>
<p>This simple test will use screener-runner to load a website and take a snapshot.</p>
<pre><code>module.exports = {
 // full repository name for your project:
 projectRepo: 'mainconfig/stepsTest',
 // this example assumes Environment Variables listed below exist on your system:
 apiKey: process.env.SCREENER_API_KEY,
  states: [
   {
     url: 'https://saucelabs.com/platform/visual-testing',
     name: 'Visual Testing Page'
   }
 ]
 };</code></pre>
<p><b>Example 2: Add interaction steps</b></p>
<p>Taking it up a notch, we’ll add interaction steps for functional flows. This test will load up a demo website, enter a username and password, click the login button, and take a snapshot. </p>
<pre><code>var Steps = require('screener-runner/src/steps');
module.exports = {
 // full repository name for your project:
 projectRepo: 'mainconfig/stepsTest',
 // this example assumes Environment Variables listed below exist on your system:
 apiKey: process.env.SCREENER_API_KEY,
  states: [
   {
     url: 'https://www.saucedemo.com/',
     name: 'Sauce Labs',
     steps: new Steps()
       .setValue('#user-name', 'standard_user') 
       .setValue('#password', 'secret_sauce', {isPassword: true})
       .click('.btn_action')
       .snapshot('signed-in')
       .end()
   },
 ]
};</code></pre>
<p>In the snapshot captured, we can deem the interactions were successful since the image will display an inventory page, which is only visible after entering credentials and clicking the .btn_action button.</p>
<div class="image"><picture><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/LNa3p39oznD1HLfbX8xaR/5686c7ac77be69bf5b08c80c6b706d1b/visualtesting_swaglabs.png?fm=webp" type="image/webp"/><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/LNa3p39oznD1HLfbX8xaR/5686c7ac77be69bf5b08c80c6b706d1b/visualtesting_swaglabs.png" alt="visualtesting swaglabs" title="visualtesting swaglabs" loading="lazy"/></picture></div>
<p><b>Example 3: Additional browsers/resolutions</b></p>
<p>Finally, run visual tests across multiple browsers and mobile resolutions by adding the “browsers” and resolutions” options:</p>
<pre><code>module.exports = {
 ...
 browsers: [
  {
    browserName: 'chrome'
  },
  {
    browserName: 'firefox'
  }
 ],
 resolutions: [
   '1024x768',
   {
     deviceName: 'iPhone X'
   }
 ]
};</code></pre>
<p>More options can be found in our <a target="_blank" href="https://screener.io/v2/docs/test-cross-browser" rel="noopener noreferrer">docs</a> and Screener Runner GitHub <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/screener-io/screener-runner" rel="noopener noreferrer">repo</a>.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Visual Testing</h3>
<p>Just like you would write a functional test to perform a click action, an interaction test is able to check for the same behavior AND take a snapshot of the page to ensure that it visually looks correct—getting a two for one deal!</p>
<p>This means testers no longer have to write and maintain thousands of lines of code to verify if an element is there, reducing the number of assertions. Testers are able to save a lot of time and use automation to purely focus on what a user sees.</p>
<h3>Visual Testing and Screener Runner</h3>
<p>Sauce Visual provides organizations the ability to quickly automate the testing of their web pages across multiple browsers and screen resolutions. It automates detecting visual and functional regressions. When used with Screener Runner, an open-source test runner, users can run lightweight E2E testing with a shortlist of Selenium-like interactions to perform visual tests on components and whole pages. It can be used to test arbitrary URLs and perform simple interactions and capture visual snapshots. </p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>As organizations are starting out and developing their testing strategy, they may want to consider adding visual testing to the list. With a visual testing solution, like Sauce Visual combined with Screener Runner, they’ll be able to run basic functional tests and reap the benefits of visual testing. This will allow them to quickly get up and running while having the coverage that they need.</p>
