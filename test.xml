										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/rodflavell" rel="nofollow noopener">Rod Flavell</a>, founder and CEO of the London-based FDM Group, believes that diversity is the key to innovation, with new ideas and perspectives driving success.</p>
<p>FDM, a leader in the recruitment, training, and deployment industry, launches thousands of technology and business careers every year across the globe. Part of the company&#8217;s philosophy is a commitment to all forms of diversity, including an Ex-Forces program designed for veterans from all ranks and services, a Women in Tech initiative, and a Returners program for experienced technologists who have had a break in their careers.</p>
<h3>The INSPIRE 20 podcast series</h3>
<p>Flavell, who has more than 35 years of experience in the tech sector, is one of the executives taking part in INSPIRE 20, a new podcast series that is showcasing 20 executives from around the world who are making a difference in terms of inclusion and diversity in their organizations, communities, and/or industries.</p>
<p><em>Listen to the podcast with Rod Flavell on <a target="_blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/inspire-20/id1510305176#episodeGuid=tag%3Asoundcloud%2C2010%3Atracks%2F968763046" rel="nofollow noopener">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/user-699370465/micro-focus-inspire-20-rod-flavell" rel="nofollow noopener">SoundCloud</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0kd56l34VKY1R35EMOPiCJ?si=_i5-xLdwRey_eaKqjgWshA" rel="nofollow noopener">Spotify</a>. Plus: Listen to<a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/inspire-20-podcast-series-tb" rel="noopener"> all of the INSPIRE 20 podcasts here</a>.</em></p>
<p><iframe allow="autoplay" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/968763046&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no"></iframe></p>
<h3>Working to make a difference</h3>
<p>FDM has won bronze, silver, and gold awards for successful deployment of its Ex-Forces program, Flavell said in the podcast. In the UK alone, &#8220;we&#8217;ve trained 700 military Scrum masters,&#8221; Flavell said. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t a single one of the UK 200 blue chip client base of FDM that hasn&#8217;t used at least one of those Scrum masters.&#8221; In fact, one of FDM&#8217;s military Scrum masters is part of the National Health Service&#8217;s COVID response team.</p>
<p>In 2019, Flavell was featured in <em>Management Today</em>&#8216;s<em> </em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/agents-change-power-list-2019/women-in-business/article/1584330" rel="nofollow noopener">Agents of Change Power List</a> for the second consecutive year and in Yahoo&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heroes-top-40-advocate-executives-230130683.html" rel="nofollow noopener">HERoes Top 40 Advocate Executives</a> for his work promoting gender equality in the workplace. </p>
<p>Flavell ensures that inclusivity is engrained in FDM&#8217;s corporate values and that the organization instills a culture of acceptance. He regularly advocates for women&#8217;s inclusion, making public statements in the <em>Telegraph</em>, <em>City AM</em>, <em>Management Today</em>, and <em>European CEO,</em> among other media outlets. FDM is also heavily involved in the Wounded Warrior Program in the UK.</p>
<h3>Others can, and should, get started</h3>
<p>In the podcast, Flavell advises other leaders or hiring managers looking to improve inclusion and diversity in their businesses to start similar initiatives.</p>
<p>All companies should not only be thinking about doing this, &#8220;but they should start in Q1 2021 and act on it,&#8221; he said in the podcast. &#8220;It is the responsibility of the chief exec of the business to own this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Building something such as the Ex-Forces program would be invaluable for other organizations, he said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;And of course the lessons are, Go in with your eyes open, and understand that you get huge benefit. But you&#8217;ve got management processes that you&#8217;ve got to be aware of when you start these things off—and don&#8217;t give up when at first the program doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/rodflavell" rel="nofollow noopener">Rod Flavell</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Keep learning</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>A common question is “does Applitools visual testing work on mobile apps?”. The answer is a resounding <a target="_blank" href="https://info.applitools.com/uc7W3" rel="noopener">YES</a>! In this post, I’ll automate a couple of scenarios and show you the power of visual testing.</p>
<h2 id="h-the-app">The App</h2>
<p>We’re going to work with a Todo App which will allow us to add tasks. A cool feature of this app is the ability to add colors to tasks, which is a great way to designate categories for our various types of tasks.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="512" height="1024" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3-512x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-26972" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3-512x1024.png 512w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3-150x300.png 150w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3-768x1536.png 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3.png 778w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"/></figure>
<h2 id="h-scenario-1-add-multiple-tasks-of-different-categories">Scenario #1: Add multiple tasks of different categories</h2>
<p>Our first scenario is to add four tasks, one for each of the different colors/categories. So here, we declare the 4 tasks and add them to the app: one for purple, blue, yellow, and pink. Next, we verify that the tasks were indeed added.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/angiejones/84e119e76d2656ec8f9458e8db5e36bd.js</p>
</div>
<p>However, a key aspect of this scenario is to verify that the tasks were added as the right color. This is a native app, so we can’t make a call to get the CSS value as that is unsupported. And when looking in the Inspector, there was nothing there that identified these tasks by color. Fortunately, visual testing can help us with this!</p>
<h3 id="h-what-is-visual-testing">What is Visual Testing?</h3>
<p>Visual testing is an automated technique for verifying the state of your application by using snapshots. This means your tests are not limited to interrogating the DOM to determine status, like what is done with most other automation tools. Instead, with visual testing, a screenshot of your application is taken on every regression run and compared against a baseline image. Therefore, viewing and verifying your application as your users would! </p>
<p>Applitools’ visual testing API is called <em>Eyes</em>. The <em>Eyes</em> API uses AI to compare the images and is much more reliable than all other forms of visual testing, namely the notoriously flaky pixel-to-pixel and DOM-based approaches offered by other vendors.</p>
<h3 id="h-adding-visual-testing">Adding Visual Testing</h3>
<p>The <em>Eyes</em> API can be added to your existing tests so there’s no need to throwout your test suite and start over! Let’s add visual testing to Scenario #1 so that we can make sure the tasks were added with the right colors.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/angiejones/67ab84d225ecaa6de84c4c4f36546905.js</p>
</div>
<p>Here we’ve added visual testing with 4 lines of code! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f632.png" alt="😲" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>On line 21, we’re simply initializing the <em>Eyes</em> API. On line 22 is where we tell <em>Eyes</em> that we would like to begin visually testing. </p>
<p>On line 23 is where the magic happens – we take a screenshot of our app. If this is the first time the test is run, this will become the baseline image. If there is already a baseline image, a new image will be taken and compared to the baseline image to determine if there are any differences. Notice the arguments sent into this call. This is telling Eyes to ignore the status bar region of our app because it is dynamic and will contain a timestamp and notifications. So this part of the app will be ignored every time the test runs!</p>
<p>Finally, on line 24, we’re done so we can close our <em>Eyes.</em> At this point, the screenshots are sent to the Applitools cloud, analyzed, and stored in a nice dashboard. In the event of a failure, your team can easily review the images to determine where the application has changed, and annotate the image with bugs and remarks.</p>
<p>But wait…</p>
<p>We added visual testing to verify the colors of the tasks. But it’s doing so much more. It’s verifying the entire screen (sans the status bar which we explicitly said to ignore. So that means all of our assertions above are already covered by <em>Eyes</em> and we can actually DELETE CODE!!! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f92f.png" alt="🤯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> In fact, we’ve deleted almost HALF of the code from this one test alone – with MORE coverage!!! Woohooo <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/angiejones/9087409345f1a2ca4c76cb2a51a288ee.js</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s try another more scenario.</p>
<h2 id="h-scenario-2-complete-a-task-from-the-list">Scenario #2: Complete a task from the list</h2>
<p>In our next scenario, we need to complete one of the tasks by clicking on it, and then verify that it is crossed off.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/angiejones/8ed376ffa81144f76907ba605a6fbd14.js</p>
</div>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="512" height="1024" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4-512x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-27026" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4-512x1024.png 512w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4-150x300.png 150w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4-768x1536.png 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"/></figure>
<p>Now when it’s time to verify, we run into the same issue we did in Scenario #1. The strikethrough on the completed task is an CSS effect, and cannot be verified using the Inspector. So, let’s use visual testing.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/angiejones/af9ad0771b31e3594f3e482c6f983679.js</p>
</div>
<p>Now we’re covered! Ok, one more scenario…</p>
<h2 id="h-scenario-3-add-long-tasks">Scenario #3: Add long tasks</h2>
<p>For the last scenario, we want to add long tasks. What is the purpose of this test? It’s to ensure that on this mobile view, the text is displayed properly and doesn’t get cut off or bleed off the edge of the page.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="504" height="1024" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5-504x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-27027" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5-504x1024.png 504w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5-148x300.png 148w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5-756x1536.png 756w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px"/></figure>
<p>But how can we make sure the text is displayed correctly without using visual testing? We can’t! We can make sure it exists. We can make sure it’s visible. But only visual testing will make sure that it’s showing up just as we intend it to.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/angiejones/791b02cbf39d6d042722c4b6ac4a8ffa.js</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h-visual-bugs-love-mobile-viewports">Visual Bugs Love Mobile Viewports</h2>
<p>Mobile testing is such a challenge. In addition to not being able to access style attributes from the Inspector, the presentation of your apps can vary based on the various viewport sizes. This makes mobile apps ripe for visual bugs! To make matters work, traditional mobile automation tools only offer so much and are incapable of catching these visual bugs, and heck, even some of the functional ones as we’ve seen in Scenarios 1 and 2. If you’re doing mobile app test automation, you <em>need</em> visual testing! Wait no more; create your <a target="_blank" href="https://info.applitools.com/uc8k5" rel="noopener">forever-free Applitools account</a> and improve your testing today!</p>
