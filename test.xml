<p>Media attention has focused on the front-line heroes who are waging war <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/tags/pandemic" rel="noopener noreferrer">against the pandemic</a>, including the doctors, nurses, police officers, emergency medical technicians, and grocery store cashiers. But thousands of information technology professionals are also among the front-line troops in this battle.</p>
<p>IT pros are creating many of the applications used to gather and share critical data about the disease spread, or about financial help that individuals and organizations can tap to carry them through this unprecedented period.</p>
<p>Here are some of the interesting development projects going on around the world right now—and how you can get involved.</p>
<p><em>[ Learn best practices for <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/reduce-defects-software-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">reducing software defects </a><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/reduce-defects-software-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide</a>.

<h3>The U.S. Digital Response</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The U.S. Digital Response</a> (USDR) is a coalition of volunteers, mostly technologists, looking to help solve the challenges that governments and government services face in the midst of the crisis.</p>
<p>Nearly 5,000 people have volunteered to help, and USDR is currently orchestrating over 150 projects with state, city, county, and local governments, said M. Jackson Wilkinson, the co-lead for the Real-Time Covid team at USDR. He oversees a team of 15, and among their efforts are CovidTracking, CovidActNow, PPE Coalition (personal protection equipment), and others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We typically dive into tricky internal data challenges to assist the governments of large cities and states. We try to quickly engage, get a handle on the problem, figure out a plan to close the gap, and hustle toward a solution.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/mjacksonw" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">M. Jackson Wilkinson</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes that&#8217;s building complete applications. Other times it&#8217;s getting existing processes automated. And other times it&#8217;s just a few Zoom calls to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Virtually all of USDR projects arise from state or local government agencies reaching out for help, Wilkinson said.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of ways that software developers can make contributions to projects such as those helped by USDR, Wilkinson said. These include writing code, doing design work, conducting rapid user research, managing projects, or just basic data entry and cleansing.</p>
<h3>hack:now</h3>
<p>This year&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://hacknow.calhacks.io" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">hack:now</a> was a 36-hour global online competition for students to advance innovative and technical solutions aimed at tackling challenges caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Held April 24 and 25, 2020, the event was cosponsored by Postman, an API development platform, and Cal Hacks, a nonprofit organization consisting of students who are passionate about fostering a culture of hacking.</p>
<p>The online hackathon was designed for the student community to work together and create solutions to trace, contain, and spread awareness about COVID-19, said Abhinav Asthana, CEO and co-founder of Postman. Toward those goals, the hackathon focused on three tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health:</strong> &#8220;While we aren&#8217;t medical professionals, we can still find additional ways to empower healthcare workers on the front lines and bring support to individuals at home,&#8221; Asthana said.</li>
<li><strong>Community:</strong> &#8220;Digital communication is more important than ever, bringing together family, friends and neighbors, as well as saving local businesses while social distancing,&#8221; Asthana said.</li>
<li><strong>Productivity:</strong> &#8220;Working or learning remotely is a novel experience for many of us. Millions of individuals stuck at home are looking for new ways to re-establish routines they had at work or school,&#8221; Asthana said.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the technical skills students learned and refined, the collaboration mindset and focus on the common good &#8220;will both influence these young developers&#8217; careers and encourage continued efforts in this pandemic.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Coronavirus Tracker</h3>
<p>No doubt the most desired information about COVID-19&#8217;s toll each day is the statistics on number of cases, death, recoveries and testings—nationwide, on an individual state basis, and globally.</p>
<p>All of that information is readily available on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.domo.com/covid19/daily-pulse/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the Coronavirus Tracker</a>, maintained by Domo. It offers up-to-date information on the spread of disease, summarized by confirmed cases, geography, testing and treatment, projections, and economic impact. Domo, a cloud computing business services provider, says it maintains the Coronavirus Tracker as a public service. </p>
<p>The highly detailed COVID-19 charts are compiled from information gathered every 10 minutes from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), John Hopkins University, Worldometer, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), the COVID Tracking Project, Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), <em>The New York Times</em>, the Wikipedia compilation of world testing, SafeGraph, Foursquare, Thumbtack, and data from the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Data Exchange.</p>
<p>Ben Schein, Domo&#8217;s vice president of data curiosity, explained how it came to be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Our team developed this interactive COVID-19 tracker over a weekend, building on Domo&#8217;s ability to rapidly bring together disparate new data sources and new data types and make it available at scale to anyone.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/benfromminn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ben Schein</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the goals was to give a broader context to the evolving pandemic, Schein explained. This included adding data on such things as economic impact, individual mobility, foot traffic, hospitalization, and COVID-19 testing.</p>
<h3>India&#8217;s COVID-19 online hackathon</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://coronathon.in/?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTkRRek1UQTVaR0ptTW1WbSIsInQiOiJSemhVRlRrdlRSckFpclFSTW02b3B2cXBWM3NKaDVlczZvUzNVeXU2RnlUSDlWTlRXNGZNK1NmZUUyOEpxVXdcL0Z2ck1RNWJGK1JtSkY5S1M2Q052U1pjcEtwWEpybFF6OG1xVVZxbXlqYm5xb05EcktheDY1SE9Xck80OFBOMm0ifQ%3D%3D" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Coronathon India</a>, held in March and April, was another online contest designed to raise awareness about COVID-19 and develop weapons to be used in the fight against it. Some 3,000 people from India&#8217;s technology, business, and healthcare communities came together to build projects to minimize the pandemic&#8217;s impact on India.</p>
<p>Over a period of four weeks, more than 40 projects were developed to help track the spread of the disease, where hotspots of infection were developing, and how testing and tracing efforts were going. Hackathon organizers noted that COVID-19 poses an especially grave danger to India, due to the country&#8217;s high population density and the &#8220;abysmally low number of hospital beds per 100 people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of the developed projects came from software professionals and involved ways to better compile and analyze data about COVID-19 cases, or apps for tracking the movements of individuals known or suspected of being positive for the disease. Other projects involved social media tools for educating people about the disease symptoms and approved precautions against it.</p>
<h3>COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium</h3>
<p>In collaboration with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the US Department of Energy, and many others, IBM helped launch <a target="_blank" href="https://covid19-hpc-consortium.org" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium</a>. The consortium is throwing an unprecedented amount of computing power—6 systems with more than 330 petaflops, 775,000 CPU cores, 34,000 GPUs, and counting—to help researchers better understand the disease, its possible treatments, and potential cures.</p>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dario-gil-58575713/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dario Gil</a>, director of IBM research, the consortium represents a true &#8220;Who&#8217;s Who&#8221; of supercomputing. Partners include the Lawrence Livermore National Lab, the Argonne National Lab, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Sandia National Laboratory, the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the National Science Foundation, NASA, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and several leading technology companies.</p>
<p>Through this program, researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the University of Tennessee screened 8,000 compounds &#8220;to find those that are most likely to bind to the main &#8216;spike&#8217; protein of the coronavirus, rendering it unable to infect host cells,&#8221; Gil said.</p>
<p>They then recommended the 77 most promising small-molecule drug compounds that could now be tested.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;This is the power of accelerating discovery through computation.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dario-gil-58575713/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dario Gil</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Graph4Good</h3>
<p>Graph data science is an important part of the efforts to track the spread of COVID-19 and the movements of those who may have been infected. In response, database vendor Neo4j launched <a target="_blank" href="https://neo4j.com/graphs4good/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the Graphs4Good project</a>, which uses the vendor&#8217;s graph database to research COVID-19.</p>
<p>The advantage of using graph data technology in the fight against COVID-19 is that it can connect large datasets from multiple sources, allowing analysis on a much larger level.</p>
<p>Graphs4Good &#8220;has helped several organizations tackle pandemic-related initiatives from contact tracing, to curtailing the spread of misinformation,&#8221; said Amy E. Hodler, director of AI and analytics programs at Neo4j.</p>
<p>Current market conditions demonstrate the blind spots of thinking about data in rows and columns, she added.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Organizations are beginning to consider the importance of the relationships between data points, which are potentially far more valuable for predictive accuracy than flat, tabular descriptors.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/amyhodler" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amy E. Hodler</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Call for Code</h3>
<p>IBM is encouraging developers to join in the fight with its <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Call for Code</a> program. It offers cash prizes, connects developers with experts and open-source resources, and helps deploy applications where they are most needed.</p>
<p>Now in its third year, the 2020 Call for Code Global Challenge is currently asking developers worldwide to build solutions for COVID-19. A second track this year looks at issues related to climate change. Both the COVID-19 track and the Climate Change track are open for submissions though July 31.</p>
<p>Response to the initial call was swift. &#8220;We&#8217;re already receiving overwhelming support and some exciting early ideas,&#8221; said Willie Tejada, general manager and chief developer advocate at IBM. In a single day, over 1,000 developers registered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;First responders, at-risk individuals, and coders are reaching out to us to share their experiences and brainstorm solutions.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/wtejada223" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Willie Tejada</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Together with Call for Code&#8217;s creator, David Clark Cause, and in partnership with the United Nations Human Rights Council and the Linux Foundation, &#8220;we&#8217;re asking developers, data scientists, and problem solvers to answer the call.&#8221;</p>
<h3>The next wave of projects and volunteers</h3>
<p>From supercomputer analysis to major data management projects to individual developer efforts, the coronavirus pandemic is inspiring an unprecedented response from IT professionals and tech companies that want to join the fight on the front lines.</p>
<p>Technology pros who want to join the fight should look first in their own state. For example, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ny.gov/programs/new-york-state-covid-19-technology-swat-team" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">COVID-19 Technology SWAT Team</a> in New York is looking for tech volunteers. But you can also do <a target="_blank" href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/0,5885,7-339-73970_71692_71696-528652--rss,00.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">volunteer to do contact tracing</a> in Michigan; and this site <a target="_blank" href="https://www.volunteermatch.org/covid19/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">matches volunteers with nationwide COVID-19 projects</a> related to healthcare, education, and small-business support needed due to the lockdown and virus&#8217;s economic fallout.</p>
<p>The next step: Find your niche, and use your skills to make a difference.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Enterprise service management (ESM) expands on the <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/how-to-get-started-w?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">principles and technology of IT service management (ITSM) </a>to add discipline, formalized methodology, and automation to how non-tech departments deliver services to internal customers.</p>
<p>Imagine for a moment that business stakeholders could ask for help from the legal department in drafting a contract, using the same kind of self-service portal they&#8217;d use to open an IT help desk ticket. Also, imagine that in delivering those requested contracts, legal had to adhere to service-level agreements (SLAs) similar to those IT is bound by in support of its users.</p>
<p>Enterprise service management is meant to facilitate precisely that kind of workflow and accountability. Here&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/16-resources-service-management?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">what your team needs to know</a> about the growing field of ESM.</p>
<p><em>[ Learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/enterprise-service-management-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to optimize your Enterprise Service Management</a> in TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide. Plus: Find out in this Webinar if <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/are-itsm-and-enterpr?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">ITSM and ESM are one and the same</a>. ]</em></p>
<h3>The evolution of ESM</h3>
<p>With decades of experience in perfecting a customer-centric attitude toward delivering IT services, ITSM professionals have learned a thing or two about <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/it-service-management-how-it-tools-practices-are-evolving" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to efficiently field and satisfy requests</a> from their business colleagues.</p>
<p>By leveraging ITSM frameworks <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/itil-4-good-bad-bottom-line" rel="noopener noreferrer">such as ITIL</a>, they&#8217;ve been able to formalize the processes around providing technical support, managing assets, responding to incidents, provisioning accounts, training users, and answering questions. ITSM is about helping both internal and external customers get the most out of the tech investments made by an organization.</p>
<p>Along with that, IT pros also typically <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-choose-it-service-management-tool" rel="noopener noreferrer">tap into ITSM technology platforms</a> to consolidate the service catalog for an IT department and to manage and track fulfillment of requests against that catalog.</p>
<p>As enterprises started witnessing the benefits of this approach, they began wondering if they could <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/extend-it-service-management?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">broaden the use of their ITSM platform</a> to amplify the results. For example, if HR can use the platform to request account provisioning for a new employee from IT, why can&#8217;t anyone in the business just as easily use it to request the broader onboarding process from the HR department for a new hire?</p>
<p>These kinds of realizations sparked a wave of nontraditional usage of ITSM tools that eventually coalesced into the establishment of ESM. In fact, when Charles Betz first defined the market for Forrester Research in 2017, <a target="_blank" href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/enterprise-service-management-the-real-system-of-engagement/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">he reported</a> that he&#8217;d spoken to numerous enterprises that said over half of the work routed through their ITSM ticketing systems were non-IT based.</p>
<p>Some hallmarks of ESM that have evolved from ITSM include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Service desk and ticketing</li>
<li>Service catalogs</li>
<li>Knowledge management</li>
<li>Self-service capabilities</li>
<li>Reporting and SLA tracking</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability to track the lifecycle of a request from initiation to fulfillment using a ticketing system has big appeal for organizations seeking to improve collaboration among departments. So does the combination of things such as knowledge management and self-service with more advanced technologies such as AI and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-use-chatops-boost-business-engagement-across-teams" rel="noopener noreferrer">chatbots</a> to automate the processing of high-volume requests to free up people to do higher-value work.</p>
<p>This is the next level that organizations that have already dipped their toes into ESM hope to achieve. In a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/assets/it-operations-management/esm-closer-than-you-think" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent study</a> by Enterprise Management Associates (EMA), 61% of organizations with mature deployments said <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/ai-transform-it-service-management?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">combining AI, analytics, and automation with ESM</a> was an extremely high priority for the coming year.</p>
<h3>ESM use cases</h3>
<p>The use cases for ESM can vary across enterprises, but some common services include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal:</strong> Contract development, legal approvals, providing counsel, and answering questions</li>
<li><strong>Facilities management:</strong> Coordinating meeting room use, equipment provisioning, visitor registration, and approvals</li>
<li><strong>Marketing</strong>: Launching campaigns to support distributed product teams, answering questions about brand guidelines, and distributing brand assets and branded collateral</li>
<li><strong>HR:</strong> Doing employee onboarding, policy enforcement, and approvals and answering policy questions</li>
</ul>
<p>One common denominator in all these use cases is that the business function providing a service catalog gets a high volume of similar requests from across the organization. Another is that they must provide some sort of action or approval to help the requester move forward on a project.</p>
<p>These requests are usually time-sensitive, and the long-term performance of the department providing the discrete services could be trackable with the right kind of technology.</p>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/assets/it-operations-management/esm-closer-than-you-think" rel="noopener noreferrer">EMA researchers</a>, &#8220;Any group that has to deal with people is a prospect for ESM. If those people are end users, employees, or customers looking for information or services, and they are used to sending their inquiries to a group email or phone message center, they are falling-off-the-tree ripe for ESM.&#8221;</p>

<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="selenium-webdriver" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium WebDriver 101</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s start by quickly understanding what WebDriver is.</p>
<p>Selenium is one of the most popular web-automation tools. Surprisingly, a lot of people actually get confused about what Selenium really is.</p>
<p>Here is the official version of what Selenium is: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/</a></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebDriver</a><i> is the </i>core of Selenium. It is an interface that uses browser automation APIs provided by browser vendors to simulate user behaviour and interaction by controlling the browser in the form of running tests.</p>
<p>WebDriver drives a browser either locally or on a remote machine using the Selenium server. Selenium WebDriver refers to both the language bindings and the implementations of the individual browser controlling code. This is commonly referred to as just <i>WebDriver</i>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Selenium Browser Automation Project</a> also lists a quick example of how to quickly get started with using WebDriver.</p>
<p>Below is another example of how this code can look like:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW">var webdriver = require('selenium-webdriver'),
    test = require('selenium-webdriver/testing'),
    assert = require('assert');

test.describe("Google Search", function() {

    test.it("should take user input correctly", function() {

        var driver = new webdriver.Builder().
            withCapabilities(webdriver.Capabilities.chrome()).build();
        driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(1000);

        driver.get("http://localhost:8082/community-app");
        var element = driver.findElement(webdriver.By.id("uid"));
        element.sendKeys("mifos");
        var value = element.getAttribute("value");
        value.then(function(value) {
            assert.equal(value, "mifos");
        });

    });

});
</pre>
<hr/>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="why-test-automation-framework" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why do we need a Test Automation Framework?</strong></h2>
<p>As seen in the above example, it is easy to get started using WebDriver to simulate user behavior.</p>
<p>However, typically, one uses WebDriver to automate many different user scenarios / interactions in order to get quick validation if the functionality in the product-under-test is working correctly, as expected. Some of these products may have a small-life, however, most of these would be around for a long time.</p>
<p>As a result, the team testing this product would have a lot of user scenarios that they would want to be automated. I have seen cases where the team has 1000s of tests identified and automated for their product-under-test.</p>
<p>In such cases, continuing to implement tests in similar ways as shown in the simple, getting-started example will quickly turn into a nightmare for various reasons of code quality, maintainability, extensibility and scalability.</p>
<p>You may set up some structure for your tests, and build some sort of a framework, but that will still be limiting as you scale.</p>
<p></p>

<p>In the above example, of test implementation in Ruby, the home_page.rb file ended up being 1000+ line long, which made it very difficult to quickly understand what this class ended up doing, and what functionality was implemented here.</p>
<p>The architecture of such a framework looks as simple as this, which could also be referred to as non-existent:</p>

<hr/>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="test-automation-criteria" rel="noopener noreferrer">Criteria for building a Test Automation Framework</strong></h2>
<p>Writing code is easy, but writing good code is not as easy. Here are the reasons why I say this:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Good” is subjective.</li>
<li>“Good” depends on the context &amp; overall objective.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, implementing <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/03/07/what-test-cases-should-you-automate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">automated test cases</a> is easy (as seen from the getting started example shared earlier). However, scaling this up to be able to implement and run a huge number of tests quickly and efficiently, against an evolving product is not easy!</p>
<p>I refer to a few principles when building a Test Automation Framework. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on the context &amp; (current + upcoming) functionality of your product-under-test, define the overall objective of <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/03/26/automation-testing-for-beginners-ultimate-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automation Testing</a>.</li>
<li>Based on the objective defined above, determine the criteria and requirements from your Test Automation Framework. Refer to my post on “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/test-automation-ai-ml/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Test Automation in the World of AI &amp; ML</a>” for details on various aspects you need to consider to build a robust Test Automation Framework. Also, you might find these articles interesting to learn how to select the best tool for your requirements:</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="test-automation-design-patterns" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Patterns in Test Automation Framework</strong></h2>
<p>Test Automation (using tools like Selenium / Appium) are essentially development activities. One needs to have good programming knowledge to be able to do implement tests that are robust, stable, efficient, fast, maintainable and extensible!</p>
<p>There are many Design Patterns available for Software Development (as seen <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). Since Test Automation is also a Development activity – The understanding of Design Patterns is critical in Test Automation as well.</p>
<p>Below are some commonly used Design Patterns one would use, directly or indirectly, in building a Test Automation Framework:</p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="page-object-pattern" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characteristics of a good Page-Object Pattern Implementation</strong></h2>
<p>A good page-object pattern implementation would have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pages are well identified.</li>
<li>Use <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern" rel="noopener noreferrer">Composite Pattern</a> to compose complex pages and also allow reuse of snippets of pages across the product.
<ul>
<li>Ex: If Search functionality is common across majority of the pages in your product, then:
<ul>
<li>Define a SearchPage object.</li>
<li>In other pages, ex: HomePage, LoginPage, ProductPage, etc, use the Composition Pattern to include SearchPage as part of its definition.</li>
<li>Example:</li>
<li><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-12715 size-full" title="Composite Pattern" alt="Composite Pattern" width="390" height="403" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GoodPageObjects.png"/><noscript><img class="alignnone wp-image-12715 size-full" title="Composite Pattern" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GoodPageObjects.png" alt="Composite Pattern" width="390" height="403"/></noscript></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pages do not have any assertions in them.</li>
<li>Pages do not have getters-setters in the pages (or in any class in your code). This is a bad practice and it breaks <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Encapsulation</a>.</li>
<li>Pages should have logical methods that do action on the page, or gets information from the page.</li>
<li>Pages should have no business logic in the Page-Object method implementation, except handling cases like:
<ul>
<li>If ex: there are Country &amp; State dropdown controls on the page, and the State values get populated based on which Country is selected, then the method selecting the Country should wait for the items in the State dropdown to get populated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each Page object should have an explicit return type, i.e. the Page object method SHOULD NOT return void.
<ul>
<li>Ex: On successful login, the method should return the HomePage object.</li>
<li>On unsuccessful login, the method should return the same LoginPage object.</li>
<li>There would be cases when you are getting information from the page itself. In such cases, the methods should return specific datatypes.
<ul>
<li>Ex: isLoggedIn should return boolean.</li>
<li>Ex: getLoggedInUserName should return String.</li>
<li>Ex: getRegisteredAddressInProfile should return a custom object Address, or any other data structure that makes sense in the context of the product-under-test.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The architecture of such a framework evolves as below:</p>

<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="page-object-pattern-challenges" rel="noopener noreferrer">Challenges of using Page-Object Pattern</strong></h2>
<p>Page Objects help implement tests easily, and keep the code well structured. This allows easy updates in the Page Objects based on evolving product functionality.</p>
<p>However, there is a challenge.</p>
<p>In the Test implementation methods, ex: if you are using <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/02/26/junit-5/" rel="noopener noreferrer">JUnit</a> / <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/10/31/the-power-of-testng-test-next-generation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestNG</a> as the test runner, then in the @Test methods, you now need to orchestrate the Page object interactions and also add your assertions.</p>
<p>Below is an example of 2 tests:</p>
<h3><strong>Test 1:</strong></h3>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">@Test
public void shouldRevertToOriginalContentAfterClickingCancel() {

    PatientInformation patientInfomation = new PatientInformation(firstName, middleName, lastName, gender);
    RegistrationPage registrationPage = new RegistrationPage();
    PatientChartPage patientChartPage = registrationPage.registerPatientWithBasicInformation(patientInfomation);

    String originalFirstName = patientChartPage.getFirstName(); 
    assertThat(originalFirstName, is(firstName)); 

    patientChartPage.updateName(newFirstName, newLastName);
    patientChartPage.updateAddressLine(newLine1, newLine2);
    patientChartPage.updateCity(newCity);
    patientChartPage.updateState(newState);
    patientChartPage.updateZip(newZip);
    patientChartPage.cancelUpdate();

    String updatedFirstName = patientChartPage.getFirstName();
    assertThat(updatedFirstName, is(originalFirstName));
}</pre>
<pre/><h3><strong>Test 2:</strong></h3><pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">@Test
public void shouldUpdateExistingPatientWithNewInformationAfterClickingSave() throws InterruptedException {

    PatientInformation expectedPatientInformation = new PatientInformation(firstName, middleName, lastName, gender);
    RegistrationPage registrationPage = new RegistrationPage();

    registrationPage.registerPatientWithBasicInformation(expectedPatientInformation);

    String originalFirstName = patientChartPage.getFirstName(); 
    assertThat(originalFirstName, is(firstName)); 
    
    patientChartPage.updateName(newFirstName, newLastName);
    patientChartPage.updateAddressLine(newLine1, newLine2);
    patientChartPage.updateCity(newCity);
    patientChartPage.updateState(newState);
    patientChartPage.updateZip(newZip);
    patientChartPage.saveUpdate();

    Driver.get().navigate().refresh();

    assertThat(patientChartPage.getFirstName(), is(newFirstName));
    assertThat(patientChartPage.getLastName()), is(newLastName));
    assertThat(patientChartPage.getCity(), is(newCity));
    assertThat(patientChartPage.getState(), is(newState));
    assertThat(patientChartPage.getAddressLine1()), is(newLine1));
    assertThat(patientChartPage.getAddressLine2()), is(newLine2));
    assertThat(patientChartPage.getZip()), is(newZip));
}</pre>
<pre/><p>Here are the challenges of this implementation:</p><ul><li>The intent of the test is lost in the details of the interaction of page objects and assertions.</li><li>The @Test methods become quite unreadable.</li><li>There is a lot of duplication in both the test implementations.</li></ul><p>As you implement more variants of test scenarios, you will encounter there would be many instances of test implementations needing slight tweaks to the implemented test to verify variants of the scenarios. In such cases, you would end up copying most of the implementation from 1 test into the others – which is wasted effort, code duplication and makes it difficult to update the tests as the product functionality evolves.</p><p>In some cases, you may be able to extract common methods in the same class to reuse the implementation, but that seems like an ad-hoc way of implementation.</p><p>That is the reason I do not like to use the Page Object Pattern directly in my Test implementation for larger implementations.</p><hr/><h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="business-layer-page-object" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solution: Business-Layer Page-Object Pattern</strong></h2><p>It is very important to have the Test specification be crisp and clear. This way the intent of the test is understood very easily and the reader knows exactly what is expected from the product-under-test as a result of running that particular test.</p><p>This is the area the Business-Layer Page-Object Pattern helps. Below is how the implementation flow is using this pattern:</p><ol><li>Tests should talk business language only! No granular operations / UI interactions.</li><li>The Test implementation is an orchestration of corresponding business operations as it is simulating a deterministic, specific scenario.</li><li>Business operations are implemented in a layer between the tests &amp; page objects – called BusinessLayer. This allows for better reuse of implementation.</li><li>Implementation of an business operation is an orchestration between other business operations, and / or an orchestration of page objects.</li><li>The business operation does the assertions of expectations, NOT page-objects.</li><li>Each business operation / page object has a valid return type (never void). Each operation (in business or page object) being successful means there are a defined number of methods / operations the product can now do (as you are driving the product under test to do your bidding).</li></ol><p>Let’s look at some examples of how this can be implemented.</p><h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="test-automation-architecture" rel="noopener noreferrer">Test Automation Framework Architecture</strong></h2><p>The overall architecture of the Test Automation Framework that allows me to implement, evolve and scale in an easy fashion is shown below:</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-12712 size-full" title="Business-Layer Page-Object Pattern" alt="Business-Layer Page-Object Pattern" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/BusinessLayer-PageObjectPattern.jpeg 1600w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/BusinessLayer-PageObjectPattern-512x288.jpeg 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/BusinessLayer-PageObjectPattern-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/BusinessLayer-PageObjectPattern-1024x576.jpeg 1024w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/BusinessLayer-PageObjectPattern.jpeg"/></p><noscript><img class="alignnone wp-image-12712 size-full" title="Business-Layer Page-Object Pattern" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/BusinessLayer-PageObjectPattern.jpeg" alt="Business-Layer Page-Object Pattern" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/BusinessLayer-PageObjectPattern.jpeg 1600w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/BusinessLayer-PageObjectPattern-512x288.jpeg 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/BusinessLayer-PageObjectPattern-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/BusinessLayer-PageObjectPattern-1024x576.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></noscript><p>Below is my folder structure for my Test Automation Framework:</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-12716 size-full" title="Test Automation Framework Structure" alt="Test Automation Framework Structure" width="440" height="740" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GoodStructure.png 440w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GoodStructure-304x512.png 304w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GoodStructure.png"/></p><noscript><img class="alignnone wp-image-12716 size-full" title="Test Automation Framework Structure" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GoodStructure.png" alt="Test Automation Framework Structure" width="440" height="740" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GoodStructure.png 440w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GoodStructure-304x512.png 304w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px"/></noscript><p>Here is the Test method – clearly highlighting the intent of the test:</p><pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">@Test(groups = {"a-addcash", "a-demo2", "a-RcRegression"})

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">The current public health crisis with COVID-19 has sent millions of software developers home. Software development teams that used to meet for daily standup meetings in conference rooms now find they <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/3-things-every-it-org-should-be-doing-get-ahead-pandemic" rel="noopener noreferrer">have been transformed into virtual teams</a> overnight.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In many companies, having teams distributed globally and working virtually is business as usual. Other dev teams are facing the challenges of adapting suddenly to a new work environment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Research and experience have shown that <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-run-design-sprint-virtual-teams" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtual teams in software development</a> face four major hurdles. Here they are, explained—along with solutions to help overcome them.</p>
<p><em>[ Learn best practices for <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/reduce-defects-software-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">reducing software defects </a><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/reduce-defects-software-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide</a>.

<h3>Maintaining the company culture</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Company culture is an immersive experience. It&#8217;s something we take for granted. Generally, experience tells us what the culture will bear in terms of relationships to family, patterns of accountability, the ratio of work to play allowed in the workspace, etc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Culture creates cohesion, impacts motivation, and regulates behaviors within an organization. Company culture also enables all contributors to interpret senior management dictates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When people work from home, these familiar signposts begin to break down. It&#8217;s sometimes difficult, in a vacuum, to interpret management communications that appear quietly in the email inbox. Absent the omnipresence of the company culture, it becomes more difficult for team members to know how to interpret communications that come from afar.</p>
<h4>How to maintain culture</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Periodic meetings where senior managers from outside the team communicate directly with the dev team, using tools such as Zoom, help mitigate the risks to company culture when teams go virtual. They also give managers an opportunity to update the strategy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ideally these would be <a target="_blank" href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/10/03/skip-level-meetings-what-they-are-and-exactly-how-to-run-them/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">skip-level meetings</a> where you, as a manager, meet one-on-one with the direct report of another manager, who in turn reports to you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It also helps teams to have a strategy document, stored in the cloud, that is a single version of the truth. The strategy should be periodically updated and stored where it is accessible to the team. It should be reviewed (briefly) before each road map meeting and cited during company all-hands meetings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The COVID-19 crisis discourages retreats or strategy workshops where everyone is invited. Although virtual retreats are difficult to pull off well, various organizations have tried them with success. They often mix in recreational activities along with sessions on culture and training on new systems.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Make the unconscious cues in the company culture conscious. Refer to them often and reinforce them. Company culture can follow your team members home, but only if it is made explicit and constantly reinforced.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Above all, calling out company culture at every opportunity helps enormously. Each and every corporate communication (announcements for new hires, departures, and reorganizations) provides great opportunities for reinforcing culture.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-increase-enterprise-collaboration-speed-your-devops-pipeline" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tools for maintaining culture</a> include in-house wikis, Google Docs, and twice-yearly retreats (including virtual).</p>
<h3>Keeping focused on the product vision</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The problem with losing track of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tcgen.com/product-development-strategy#spp-tool-5" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">product vision</a> is that the software dev team will lose cycles as it addresses the wrong problems. The greatest danger is time wasted in nonproductive work that does not tie to the product vision.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the worst-case scenario, a team that <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/projects-products-what-it-means-why-it-matters" rel="noopener noreferrer">loses sight of the product vision</a> can deliver the wrong solution at the end of a long and expensive dev cycle.</p>
<h4>How to maintain focus </h4>
<p>Hold monthly road map reviews, where alignment with the product vision and the app under development is discussed and updated. Look over the product road map and release trains, assess where you&#8217;ve been, where you’re planning to go, and what the next steps should be.</p>
<p>Again, having a simple, one-page product vision—representing a single, shared version of the truth—helps.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another solution is to use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tcgen.com/tools-from-book/boundary-conditions-diagram" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">boundary conditions</a>, a tool of exception management. In this methodology, the dev team and upper management agree on the minimum viable product (MVP). They then break it down to three to five parameters of the project—such as project cost, product cost, features, timing, and quality—and define quantitative metrics for each of these parameters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then the dev team does its work without interference from upper management, as long as it looks as if it will hit its quantitative targets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the project begins to go off course, then a lightweight <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tcgen.com/tools-from-book/out-of-bounds-check" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">escalation process</a> kicks in that helps the team get back on track. Having clear parameters to work toward helps keep the team focused, ultimately, on the original product vision.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another way to face the challenge of losing track of the vision is to appoint a proxy <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-agile-distinguishes-between-product-managers-product-owners" rel="noopener noreferrer">product owner/product manager</a> on your dev team. This person should work in the same time zone as the majority of the team, be empowered to answer questions as they arise, and shepherd the software project toward its goals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tools for managing the product vision include wikis, Google Docs, road maps, and others.</p>
<p><em>[ Understand what your team needs to know to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com//l/software-test-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">take advantage of test automation</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide.

<h3>Staying true to agile methodologies</h3>
<p dir="ltr">How can teams maintain the integrity and power of agile methodology <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/distributed-agile-teams-8-hacks-make-them-work" rel="noopener noreferrer">when the members are physically separate</a>? Most of the principles of agile imply a collocated team. For example, from <a target="_blank" href="http://agilemanifesto.org" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the Agile Manifesto</a>: &#8220;The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.&#8221; </p>
<p dir="ltr">This can happen over videoconferencing, of course, but the authors certainly intended &#8220;face-to-face&#8221; to mean in person. </p>
<h4>How to maximize remote agile teams</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Thankfully, some of the elements of the Agile Manifesto can more easily apply to virtual teams. For example, principles of agile such as &#8220;continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility&#8221; also apply to virtual software teams.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As teams become virtual, make sure that you have defined and put in place a minimal set of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.clearlyagileinc.com/agile-blog/what-are-agile-ceremonies" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">required agile events</a>. One definition of an agile event: The meetings prescribed to carry out the Scrum framework, which give Scrum its regularity and structure. Choose the vital few, or risk spending all your time on process, rather than on real work.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remote agile is an area where technology helps. Essential agile tools include backlog, definition of &#8220;done,&#8221; burndown chart, release plan, and retrospectives. And each of these has an app that can help.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The most important aspect of staying agile in virtual teams is to keep the roles of the Scrum master (SM) and product owner (PO). And you should have SM and PO proxies for each group of team members who share a common time zone. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Their role is to stop and answer questions within an hour that might hang up a developer for a day. For bigger issues, the proxies can reach back to the true product owner for confirmation of the direction given locally. The proxies have a fast track to the primary PO and SM and can get a same-day (or 24-hour) response.</p>
<h3>Managing for collaboration day in and day out</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Working beside other people in a collocated environment has many advantages in terms of communication. For example, when one team member is on the phone, perhaps speaking to an internal or external customer, team members located nearby can hear one-half of the phone conversation and intuit the rest.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Information conveyed in this ambient manner is important, and it is almost impossible to replicate in a virtual team environment.</p>
<h4>How to manage collaboration</h4>
<p dir="ltr">One commonly used countermeasure is finding a virtual replacement for real-life bonding, like sharing personal weekend plans or even a virtual happy hour. But virtual teams can take several steps to ensure that they keep collaborating effectively even on lockdown.</p>
<p dir="ltr">First, make it clear, through a release planning document and through boundary conditions, what it is you&#8217;re collaborating on. At the beginning of a project, make sure that you have defined roles and responsibilities. Now is not the time for team members to have only a vague idea about who is the directly responsible individual for a given deliverable. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tcgen.com/tools-from-book/circle-dot-chart" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Circle Dot Chart</a> is a tool that can help teams define and maintain roles and responsibilities as they work virtually.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You can also create transparency for teamwork by having a shared workspace, and sharing interim work products in a cloud-based environment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Above all, have version control protocols and observe them. Version control for all documents and work product is especially vital where teams are not located in the same time zone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All team members must not only have a single version of the truth, but also know that it is the most current version, the latest and greatest version of your work. Managing the permissions in your tools is important. Make one individual responsible for the document and allow only that person to edit it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tools for collaboration include <a target="_blank" href="https://almanac.io/articles/19090/spade-decision-making-framework" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the SPADE decision-making framework</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://fellow.app" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Fellow.app</a>, which has both free and pro versions.</p>
<h3>Hire and communicate for virtual team success</h3>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to meeting these four challenges, virtual teams raise questions related to hiring and communication. Hiring remote developers is difficult given the time-zone and language challenges. Specialized hiring firms can serve as resources to help you recruit and select candidates when trying to scale rapidly. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Don&#8217;t forget onboarding. It is one thing to bring in a new hire into headquarters, but entirely different to bring someone into the organization who will not see the company office for six months or longer. Document your onboarding process and have videos that can be watched locally.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You also need to prepare new hires for work. There are scripts that can configure a laptop for instant productivity with tools preloaded for code repositories, development environments, and links to company resources.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With virtual software teams, communication and decision making are often difficult challenges. For example, daily stand-up meetings are nearly impossible if conducted as if the team were located in the same building. Time-zone optimization is one tool that organizations use.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They try to formulate teams so that at least four hours are in common between core team members. If you can&#8217;t get everyone together for a standup, some firms perform asynchronous check-ins using Slack. Other firms have used Basecamp for standups as well. </p>
<p>Unprecedented times call for unprecedented measures. It&#8217;s imperative to the strategies of many companies that <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/why-agile-leadership-key-these-uncertain-times" rel="noopener noreferrer">they do not lose steam</a> due to events outside of their control.</p>
<p>With some thought and innovation, virtual development teams can maintain the best principles of their company cultures, stay focused on their product vision, stay true to agile, and collaborate effectively. The keys are clarity, process, and the appropriate technology. With these in place, virtual teams can forge ahead, without missing a step.</p>

            </div>
<p>On June 16<sup>th</sup>, the Department of Homeland Security and CISA ICS-CERT <a target="_blank" href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-168-01" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued</a> a critical security <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/257161" rel="noopener noreferrer">advisory</a> warning covering multiple newly discovered vulnerabilities affecting Internet-connected devices manufactured by multiple vendors. This set of 19 vulnerabilities in a low-level TCP/IP software library developed by Treck has been dubbed “Ripple20” by researchers from JSOF.</p>
<p>A networking stack is a software component that provides network connectivity over the standard internet protocols. In this specific case these protocols include ARP, IP (versions 4 and 6), ICMPv4, UDP and TCP communications protocols, as well as the DNS and DHCP application protocols. The Treck networking stack is used across a broad range of industries (medical, government, academia, utilities, etc.), from a broad range of device manufacturers – a fact which enhances their impact and scope, as each manufacturer needs to push an update for their devices independently of all others. In other words, the impact ripples out across the industry due to complexities in the supply and design chains.</p>
<p>Identifying vulnerable devices on your network is a crucial step in assessing the risk of Ripple20 to your organization. While a simple <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shodan.io/search?query=treck" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shodan search for “treck”</a> shows approximately 1000 devices, which are highly likely to be internet-facing vulnerable devices, this represents only a fraction of the impacted devices. Identification of the Treck networking stack vs. other networking stacks (such as the native Linux or Windows stacks) requires detailed analysis and fingerprinting techniques based on the results of network scans of the devices in question.</p>
<p>The impact of these vulnerabilities ranges from denial of service to full remote code exploitation over the internet, with at least one case not requiring any authentication (<a target="_blank" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11901" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2020-11901</a>). JSOF researchers identified that these vulnerabilities impact a combination of traditional and IoT devices. Customers should review advisories from vendors such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00295.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://support.hp.com/in-en/document/c06640149" rel="noopener noreferrer">HP</a> because non-IoT devices may be running firmware that makes use of the Treck networking stack.</p>
<p>Ripple20’s most significant impact is to devices whose network stack is exposed (in general IoT devices incorporating the Treck network stack) as compared to devices that incorporate the stack that it is only exposed to the local device. We recommend that you audit all network-enabled devices to determine if they are susceptible to these vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>There are potentially tens of millions of devices that are vulnerable to at least one of the Ripple20 flaws. Mitigating impact requires attention from both device owners and device vendors.</p>
<h3><strong>Mitigations for users of vulnerable devices per CISA recommendations (where possible): </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Patch any device for which a vendor has released an update.</li>
<li>Practice the principle of least privilege for all users and devices (devices and users should only have access to the set of capabilities needed to accomplish their job). In this case, minimize network exposure and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet-accessibility</a> for all control system devices.</li>
<li>Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.</li>
<li>When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that a VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. VPN solutions should use multi-factor authentication.</li>
<li>Use caching DNS servers in your organization, prohibiting direct DNS queries to the internet. Ideally, caching DNS servers should utilize DNS-over-HTTPS for lookups.</li>
<li>Block anomalous IP traffic by utilizing a combination of firewalls and intrusion prevention systems.</li>
</ul>
