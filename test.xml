<div>
<p>The widespread use of Kubernetes is testament to enterprises&#8217; faith in their ability not just to handle the complexity of modern app development and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/sap-modernization-enterprise-devops-tb/modernize-legacy-apps?lx=AL8Ybs&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">modernization initiatives</a>, but to do so at scale.</p>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CNCF_Survey_Report.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a recent survey of 1,340 technical experts</a> in companies of all sizes, conducted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), 78% of respondents are <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/one-year-using-kubernetes-production-lessons-learned" rel="noopener noreferrer">using the open-source container orchestration tool in production</a>. This is up from just 58% last year.</p>
<p>But while Kubernetes is one of the most popular projects on GitHub, many organizations are still <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/47-advanced-tutorials-mastering-kubernetes" rel="noopener noreferrer">intimidated by its complexity</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Organizations have seen <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb/move-app-to-continuous-delivery?lx=-DC2cJ&amp;custom_url=continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">the value of building </a><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb/move-app-to-continuous-delivery?lx=-DC2cJ&amp;custom_url=continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">microservices</a>—delivering applications as discrete functional parts, each of which can be delivered as a container and managed separately. But for every application there are more parts to manage, especially at scale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kubernetes solves that problem by providing an extensible, declarative platform that <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/capistrano-kubernetes-lessons-phraseapps-transition" rel="noopener noreferrer">automates the management of containers</a> for high availability, resiliency, and scale. But Kubernetes is a big, complex, fast-moving, and sometimes confusing platform that requires users to develop new skills. The Kubernetes project itself recently completed a security audit. (Here&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/kubernetes-security-audits-what-admins-need-know-do" rel="noopener noreferrer">what admins need to know</a> about it.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Companies developing their <a target="_blank" href="http://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/kubernetes-heralds-cloud-native-era" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud-native strategies</a>, including <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/ai-ops-transform-it-tb/ai-cloud-ops-efficiency?lx=my3YKV&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">what platforms and tools they should use</a> to ensure the safe deployment of cloud-native apps, may benefit from understanding Kubernetes&#8217; security challenges, which fall into four main buckets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are the challenges you&#8217;ll face, and recommendations for mitigating them.</p>
<p><em>[ Get up to speed on <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/it-operations-monitoring-tb?utm_campaign=00134846&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_source=techbeacon" rel="noopener noreferrer">IT Operations Monitoring with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide</a>.

<h3>1. Hardening and compliance</h3>
<p dir="ltr">When using Kubernetes, you must be hyperfocused on what is and is not turned on by default. For example, pod security policies are key to securing a multi-tenant cluster, but the feature is still beta and is not turned on by default. The feature-rich Kubernetes platform can make it <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-configure-harden-your-managed-kubernetes-services" rel="noopener noreferrer">challenging to understand the default features</a>, but it is essential to figure it out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Organizations can <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/4-lessons-soc-metrics-what-your-secops-team-needs-know" rel="noopener noreferrer">use security benchmarks</a> to help harden Kubernetes. The Center for Internet Security, for example, provides configuration guidelines to harden systems, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">including Kubernetes</a>, against evolving cyber threats.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Having this type of step-by-step checklist can go a long way toward securing a system as complex as Kubernetes. However, since security is always about risk management, organizations need to evaluate <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/3-best-practices-container-performance-testing" rel="noopener noreferrer">the impact of certain settings on performance</a> and weigh the risks versus the benefits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some organizations don&#8217;t have the skillsets or time <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/6-best-practices-highly-available-kubernetes-clusters" rel="noopener noreferrer">to harden Kubernetes</a> on their own. It can be a huge job to ensure that the desired configuration of the cluster is set and maintained to include things such as ensuring access to the API server is always over HTTPS, that X.509 certificates are used to authenticate communication between platform components, or that the etcd datastore is encrypted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Organizations that are overwhelmed by even this relatively short list might want to consider a commercial implementation of Kubernetes that has already done the hardening.</p>
<h3>2. Managing configurations of all workloads deployed on the cluster</h3>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to managing the configuration of the cluster, organizations need to manage the configurations of all the workloads running on the cluster. You can use the <a target="_blank" href="https://helm.sh" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">open-source tool Helm Charts</a> to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-manage-containers-scale-3-challenges" rel="noopener noreferrer">automate application provisioning and configuration</a> for Kubernetes as well as to deploy simple or complex applications made up of several separate services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, while Helm is very useful for managing Day 1 operations, it does not extend to Day 2 operations, which is where Kubernetes operators shine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Operators are a way to package, deploy, and manage complex applications designed to run on Kubernetes. Operators take human operational knowledge and encode it into software that is packaged with the application and shared.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They make it easier for application developers to deliver automated lifecycle management for the services that run on Kubernetes. Helm Charts can also be wrapped in a Kubernetes operator and used together.</p>
<p>When it comes to security, operators ensure that services deployed on Kubernetes maintain supported configurations; if an unsupported configuration is made to a deployed service, operators can reset the service to its original, declared configuration.</p>
<p>The really interesting thing is that you can use Kubernetes operators to manage Kubernetes itself, making it easier to deliver and automate secured deployments.</p>
<p><em>[ Robotic Process Automation can do mundane tasks, allowing you to get strategic. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/8743/396776?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Find out how in this April 28 Webinar.</a></em> <em>Plus</em><em>: Learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/robotic-process-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to roll out RPA</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide. ]</em></p>
<h3>3. Managing multi-tenant clusters</h3>
<p>As Kubernetes scales, it becomes more and more difficult to manage all workloads deployed on the clusters and the clusters themselves. Multi-tenancy is one of the most effective ways to handle what could easily become chaotic. Indeed, Kubernetes&#8217; support for multi-tenancy has come a long way.</p>
<p>Key capabilities include the following, (which, you should note, are not always turned on by default):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Namespaces,</strong> which allow organizations to isolate multiple teams within the same physical cluster when used with RBAC (defined below) and network policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Role-based access control (RBAC) </strong>determines whether a user is allowed to perform a given action within a cluster or namespace. To help simplify the use of RBAC, consider the use of default roles that can be bound to users and groups cluster-wide or locally per namespace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Resource quotas in Kubernetes </strong>limit aggregate resource consumption per namespace, making systems less vulnerable to attacks such as denial of service. By default, all resources in a Kubernetes cluster are created with unbounded CPU and memory requests/limits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Network policy for micro-segmentation</strong> specifies how groups of pods communicate with each other and other network endpoints. Policies are namespace-scoped. By default, if no policies are set in a namespace, ingress and egress traffic is allowed to and from pods in that namespace.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Balancing security and agility</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The pressure is on for organizations to constantly innovate, which makes it easy to treat security as an afterthought. Ideally, security is built into the DevOps cycle, but organizations will benefit by explicitly adding &#8220;sec&#8221; into the middle of DevOps—or, put another way, by <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/6-devsecops-best-practices-automate-early-often" rel="noopener noreferrer">building as much security automation</a> into the pipeline as possible.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To ensure that app dev organizations can implement security best practices, take a step back and revisit your CI/CD pipelines. Are they using automated unit and functional tests? Have they integrated automated security gates such as integrated vulnerability scanners?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ops can help with DevSecOps by adding features to both development and production clusters that make it easy for the app dev team to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-microservices-broke-monitoring-how-fix-it" rel="noopener noreferrer">leverage monitoring, alerting, and logging services</a> in a uniform way while developing and deploying microservice-based apps.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition, while adding a service mesh to a Kubernetes cluster may seem to add complexity, it&#8217;s actually making important business logic more visible. Previously, developers needed to build the logic into their code. Now, these capabilities can be made available as part of the Kubernetes platform, saving developers work and accelerating the delivery of microservices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A service mesh also provides more visibility for microservice interactions to the operations team, especially when observability and visualization of east-west cluster traffic are included as part of the service mesh solution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But this is not just about tools; it&#8217;s also about culture and process. Ideally, this kind of self-assessment work, along with changes to the CI/CD pipeline, is done in collaboration with the organization&#8217;s security team, creating an opportunity for <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-bridge-security-development-divide" rel="noopener noreferrer">developers to learn more about security and vice versa</a>. After all, there&#8217;s a shortage of security professionals, so let&#8217;s work together and spread the wealth.</p>
<h3>Use the tools and techniques at your disposal</h3>
<p>Build security capabilities into your software that make it as easy as possible for your organization to meet its security goals without having to rely on a large collection of point products that may or may not work well together.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s terrific to see the Kubernetes community invest not only in traditional security evaluations, such as the Kubernetes security audit, but also in the full spectrum of capabilities that enhance security, including hardening guidance, RBAC, pod security policies, network policies, service mesh, and operators.</p>

<h3>Parasoft Selenic and Applitools Eyes Integrate to Improve Web UI Testing</h3>
<p>Guest Author: Joyce (Joy) Ruff, Product Marketing Manager at Parasoft.</p>
<p>In a web application design, the user interface (UI) can make or break the usability. To verify the UI works well, you need to ensure that you can thoroughly test it. As applications become more complex and more difficult to test, an automated test environment provides better visibility to potential web UI issues. </p>
<p>For many companies, Selenium is the de facto standard for web UI testing. Parasoft introduced the Selenic tool to enhance Selenium test creation with the page object model, simplify maintenance with self-healing, and reduce testing time with optimized execution. With Parasoft Selenic, you can understand if your Selenium tests have broken due to locators or wait conditions and receive AI-powered recommendations for how to fix them.</p>
<p>With the latest release, Selenic now provides integration with Applitools, which uses AI to capture screenshots of UI differences that can be hard to see without the aid of computer vision. The combination of these capabilities makes it easier for you to assess the results of your Web UI testing. With a simple configuration setup, when you run your Selenium tests with Selenic, an Applitools Visual AI screenshot will be automatically captured at each click and navigation step, ensuring maximum test coverage with incredible speed, accuracy, and stability.</p>
<p>See how fast and easy it is to integrate Applitools and Selenic for better visibility of your web UI changes in this short video.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>We’ve always provided open source projects with access to <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/solutions/open-source" rel="noopener noreferrer">our full-service live and automated testing capabilities</a> to help them keep their software bug-free. Now, we’re extending our Open Sauce program to offer free and reduced-cost testing for organizations innovating to address COVID-19. </p>
<p>Our Open Sauce program offers access to thousands of browser, OS, and emulator/simulator combinations, five concurrent sessions for testing in parallel, and unlimited testing minutes. To support the COVID-19 response, we’re also now offering qualifying organizations real devices for live testing on mobile devices.</p>
<p>One company, <a target="_blank" href="https://nsightify.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">nSightify</a>, is now leveraging our COVID-19 support offering for testing. nSightify has a mobile app designed to facilitate communications for first responders such as firefighters and EMS workers. They reached out to Sauce when they saw the need to add a telehealth feature to their mobile app to enable paramedics and other first responders to quickly consult with doctors to determine whether a COVID-19 patient needs hospitalization or can be treated elsewhere. This feature allows first responders to get eyes on the patient quickly and ensure they’re treated appropriately, which means better patient care… and the added benefit that hospital and emergency resources can stay available for the most critical cases.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>“Leveraging the Sauce Labs Continuous Testing cloud has allowed us to test quickly on real devices and quickly get our telehealth feature to market,” says John Dadey, CEO of nSightify.  “We went from manually testing one device at a time to automating the process, and it’s helped us reduce our overall testing time by 50-70%.” </p>
<p>The Open Sauce program offers several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ability to get up and running fast with live and automated testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instant access to our Virtual Device Cloud for testing desktop and mobile websites and applications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to share test results—videos, screenshots and log files—via Slack, HipChat or email, making collaboration a cinch</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To see if your organization qualifies for free or reduced-cost testing under the Open Sauce program, please fill out the <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/open-sauce" rel="noopener noreferrer">form on our website</a>.</p>

<p>From online retail to finance, and from streaming entertainment to healthcare providers and agencies, all manner of businesses and government entities have seen their web traffic and app activity explode. COVID-19 has changed everything for many organizations, and it did so overnight, with no time to prepare.</p>
<p>Microsoft says the use of its Teams collaboration software in Italy <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/03/31/microsoft_corrects_cloud_surge_claim/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">increased by 775% in March alone</a>, sending the company scrambling to increase capacity while implementing <a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/update-2-on-microsoft-cloud-services-continuity/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">temporary restrictions and quotas</a> for Azure customers to prevent systems from going offline.</p>
<p>While performance is increasingly being considered during the software design phase, more typically <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-engineering-critical?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">performance engineering </a><a target="_blank" href="http://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-engineering-critical?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">is an iterative process</a> that occurs after a service or app has been launched. If the system is bogging down due to heavy load, engineers figure out <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-engineering-techniques?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">what they can do to make it better</a>, whether that&#8217;s redesigning code through component decoupling or simply deploying cloud services such as caching systems and content delivery networks. Performance improves, and everyone relaxes.</p>
<p>But enterprises such as Instacart, Zoom, Amazon, and Netflix just don&#8217;t have the luxury of time in the new COVID-19 reality. Last month, <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/netflix-streaming-hits-all-time-highs-coronavirus-1203543218/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Netflix usage</a> hit its all-time high, and it&#8217;s still going up. Analysts and users alike are increasingly worried whether it and other Internet services <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/05/should-netflix-fear-crashes-in-a-high-traffic-time.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">can handle the load</a>.</p>
<p>So far, they&#8217;ve been able to, through a combination of savvy business decisions and clever engineering. TechBeacon spoke with several tech leaders to suss out the best practices that were keeping these types of services afloat amid the huge—and sudden—crush of activity, and what other organizations can learn from how they&#8217;re coping.</p>
<p>Here are four best practices from the front lines of <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-testing-to-engineering?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">performance engineering</a>.</p>

<h3>1. Embrace simplicity</h3>
<p>James Pulley, co-host of the performance testing podcast <a target="_blank" href="https://www.perfbytes.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">PerfBytes</a>, harkens back to another event that changed much overnight. During 9/11, the major online news organizations &#8220;had to move to a highly simplified web page because they were getting so much traffic,&#8221; he said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;They got rid of fancy graphics to reduce the number of bytes they were sending. Today, the same strategy is being employed at a Netflix level, reducing bit rates at the top end.&#8221; <br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/perfpulley" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">James Pulley</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure enough, the company has <a target="_blank" href="https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/reducing-netflix-traffic-where-its-needed" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">voluntarily cut its bandwidth usage</a> in Europe. This doesn&#8217;t just help keep streaming from overloading public networks, but it also helps Netflix servers avoid a meltdown.</p>
<p>Byte creep is a real problem, Pulley said. The <a target="_blank" href="https://speedcurve.com/blog/web-performance-page-bloat/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">average size of a web page</a> grew from about 1MB in 2011 to 3MB in 2017, and it&#8217;s still on the rise. As such, the first step organizations need to take to weather a traffic crush is to cut the fat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If you have six web beacons, go to one. If you have a style sheet full of artifacts, get all of that out.&#8221;<br />—James Pulley</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use Minify and Zip where possible; you want the data you send to be as small as it can be. And make sure your cache model is refined and working. If you see a file that hasn&#8217;t changed in five years that&#8217;s still being requested every five days, &#8220;you&#8217;re wasting bandwidth,&#8221; he added. Finally, be more aggressive about returning resources to the pool by giving shorter sessions to users.</p>
<h3>2. Treat data like code</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-yeh-7339897/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Matt Yeh</a>, senior director of product marketing at DataOps platform vendor Delphix, said that one way to scale your development cycles to handle increased demand is by focusing on agility in the data tier. This means getting teams to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/want-effective-test-automation-devops-manage-your-test-data" rel="noopener noreferrer">treat data the same way they treat code</a>.</p>
<p>Feeding and refreshing test data for cloud-based test environments from an on-premises production instance &#8220;is harder than many leaders think,&#8221; he said. Without the ability to automate data delivery as part of a DevOps workflow in the cloud, &#8220;a data agility problem is created that drives bad behavior and slows the delivery pipeline.&#8221;</p>
<p>Data agility is the most important factor for application development, because while code is being built and deployed via self-service, &#8220;the data tier still remains rigid and resistant to the same level of speed and automation at most organizations,&#8221; Yeh said.</p>
<p>Make your tools and processes address the data tier in the same way teams have improved the flow of their application code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;You can eliminate data-related waste, rework, and wait times.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-yeh-7339897/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Matt Yeh</a></p>

<h3>3. Take a &#8216;shift-left&#8217; approach to quality</h3>
<p>The Rule of 10 says that after each step of quality assurance, it is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.design4manufacturability.com/DFM_article.htm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">10 times harder and more expensive to fix a defect</a>. To address this, said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/weisstal?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tal Weiss</a>, CTO of software quality tool vendor OverOps, many organizations are starting to understand the merits of adopting a shift-left approach to quality.</p>
<p>This means that by increasing quality measures taken in the development and testing phases of software delivery, you can <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/shift-your-testing-how-increase-quality-not-anxiety" rel="noopener noreferrer">significantly reduce the odds of production issues</a>. This mindset can be applied to the data tier as much as it can be to code.</p>
<h3>4. Embrace performance engineering tools</h3>
<p>&#8220;Performance engineering and testing doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to change, but it definitely needs to happen,&#8221; said Guillaume Quintard, software engineer for content delivery network vendor Varnish Software.</p>
<p>Performance engineering teams need to understand where their breaking point is and have a proactive plan in place for what to do when it is reached to avoid an outage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;As an industry, we&#8217;ve had these tools for a long time.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/gquintard_?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Guillaume Quintard</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mike Canney, business development and product strategy professional at performance analytics tool vendor Accedian, expanded on that thought. Performance engineering teams typically have a very good understanding from a systems perspective, but &#8220;what&#8217;s missing is a real understanding of the network and application visibility,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>To get a complete picture of network performance, you have to understand things like bandwidth and latency, he said. &#8220;You need to be able to see how having multiple users impacts bandwidth, and how much bandwidth and latency impacts response time.&#8221; </p>
<p>Canney also noted that sheer bandwidth isn&#8217;t always the issue. There are many variables that can affect a network.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Before you throw money at expanding bandwidth, make sure that&#8217;s actually the problem by utilizing network visibility tools.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/mikecanney" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mike Canney</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Other factors to weigh</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to understand business transactions—measuring the unit of work that is actually performed in each transaction. For example, a single search on a retail website may ultimately create thousands of micro-transactions as the item is located, inventory is measured, the offering of upsells or related goods is weighed, and so on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Once you understand the business transactions and what goes into them, it&#8217;s much easier to do network modeling and predictive analysis.&#8221;<br />—Mike Canney</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, all organizations need to take a long-term approach to performance engineering. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Testing is more relevant than ever, but relying on traditional tests is no longer an option.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/weisstal?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tal Weiss</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Building in automated quality gates and feedback loops will allow for thorough, fast testing that doesn&#8217;t hold up release timelines. This can be done by leveraging a variety of automated testing methods within your CI/CD pipeline, such as static and dynamic code analysis.</p>
<h3>Process and procedure trump everything</h3>
<p>Goutham Belliappa, vice president of AI engineering at Capgemini, sums up the matter by noting that the overarching issue surrounding traffic surges is not usually a technical one but a human one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;COVID-19 has forced many companies to go digital, even those that thought they were unable to. For many businesses, bandwidth is being slammed, but the problem is more of a process and procedure one.&#8221; <br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/GBELLIAP" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Goutham Belliappa</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, VPNs hastily rolled out to workers who were never envisioned as working from home have only exacerbated problems for IT departments that also are no longer in the office.</p>
<p>The bottom line: The tools needed to weather the storm are already in most organizations&#8217; collective arsenals, but development teams need to more fully utilize them and better understand how the data tier <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-predictive-analytics-can-boost-app-performance" rel="noopener noreferrer">affects application performance</a>.</p>
<p>The good news is that it&#8217;s easy to take some smart first steps. Reducing data overhead and minimizing data transfer—even if it&#8217;s only temporary—are essential ones to keeping your services up and running during this crisis.</p>

<div id=""><picture class="single-article__img"><source media="(max-width: 899px)" data-lazy-srcset="https://testguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PerfGuildInTroublesTimes-575x360-c-default.png"></source></picture>
<p>As we enter the fifth month of the year I&#8217;m sure no one predicted the trouble times we would find ourselves in 2020.</p>
<p>More than a few companies were caught off guard by how COVID-19 impacted traffic to their websites.</p>
<p>The bad news is that some sites completely crashed due to the spike in traffic.</p>
<h2>Site Down Due to Performance Issues</h2>
<p>Image if Netflix went down for 24 hrs. Netflix usage has gone up a lot amid COVID-19, but how would you feel if you could not access it for 24 hrs due to performance issues?</p>
<p>This is what happened to the stock trading app, <a target="_blank" href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robinhood</a>. Recently, it went down for 24 hours during what was probably one of the stock market&#8217;s most significant swings—costing their users millions of dollars.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RobinHood?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener noreferrer">#RobinHood</a> bunch of crooks. Can’t sell my positions… for last hour. Server not working… I’m clearing all of my money out today and closing the account….. <a target="_blank" href="https://t.co/r0T5flOn99" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/r0T5flOn99</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>The reason for this significant outage?</p>
<p>Due to a surge in traffic, their system struggled with unprecedented load and crashed.</p>

<h2>Why Performance Engineering Matters</h2>
<p>How many users and how much long-term revenue do you think Robinhood lost because of bad performance?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Wow, it’s crazy <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener noreferrer">@RobinhoodApp</a> has been down on both it’s app and website. Can’t close opened positions. I swear the last time I use this app. This is not the First time this has happened . <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/robinhood?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener noreferrer">#robinhood</a> app crash</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Remember that top software engineering companies considers performance, not as a nice-to-have, but as a crucial feature of their products.</p>
<p>But most engineering teams don&#8217;t regularly test the performance and scalability of their applications &amp; infrastructure, and most lack the<br />tools or knowledge to do so correctly.</p>
<p>The good news is that this has only highlighted the importance of, and need for, more performance testing.</p>
<p>But how will your company approach their performance engineering as we move forward? Do you have a plan in place? Do you even know where to start?</p>
<h2>PerfGuild 2020 Registration Open</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://guildconferences.com/conferences/perfguild-2020/" rel="attachment wp-att-996274 noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-996274" alt="PerfGuild 2020" width="800" height="419" srcset="https://testguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PerfGuild_TShirt.png 800w, https://testguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PerfGuild_TShirt-1200x0-c-default.png 1200w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src="https://testguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PerfGuild_TShirt.png"/><noscript><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-996274" src="https://testguild.com/wp-content/plugins/gumlet/assets/images/pixel.png" alt="PerfGuild 2020" width="800" height="419" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-gmsrc="https://testguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PerfGuild_TShirt.png"/></noscript></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m excited to announce the opening of the third annual <a target="_blank" href="https://guildconferences.com/conferences/perfguild-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PerfGuild</a>.</p>
<p>I know what you’re thinking – not another online event <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>But Test Guild’s mission since <em>2017</em> has been to deliver the best of the conference experience, filled with actionable testing advice, all online.</p>
<p>This is not a pivot, a fad, or a second option for us — we have <strong>only </strong>done and will <strong>only do</strong> <em>online conferences</em> using our proven, guild-style community-driven platform.</p>
<p>You can trust us not to waste your time with a quickly-pulled-together, poorly run, online event.</p>
<p>We’ll be here for you long after all the craziness going on in the world with lockdowns and social distancing is over.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re bringing together some of the best experts in the world when it comes to performance testing.</p>
<p>During the conference, you&#8217;ll learn what works. More importantly, what doesn&#8217;t work for some of the top experts I could find to help you create or improve your performance engineering efforts.</p>
<p>Check out the Third Annual PerfGuild online conference, where some of the top performance-engineering experts in the industry will teach you what is working right now.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://guildconferences.com/conferences/perfguild-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to get your early-bird ticket at 50%</a>. (This offer expires May 5, after which the price will increase.)</p>
<p>At the @testguilds #perfguild20 you&#8217;ll discover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hybrid load testing using real browsers</li>
<li>Effective performance engineering</li>
<li>Leveraging your automation scripts for performance testing</li>
<li>A code-first approach to performance engineering</li>
<li>Java performance testing tips</li>
<li>How to add front-end performance to your SDLC</li>
<li>How to add distortion and variance to your performance tests to find black swan performance events caused by things like COVID-19</li>
<li>Much, much more</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why You Should Join This Online Performance Testing Event in 2020</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s what a few of our past PerfGuild attendees said about their experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Perf Guild has probably been the best training money I have ever spent in my 18 years with Deere and 15 years with the DoD.” – Randy Stevenson</p>
<p>“There was a lot of good info provided at a low cost. I&#8217;d definitely say its money well spent.”</p>
<p>“The format is great, you&#8217;ve nailed it! I like that I get the social aspect from home.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://guildconferences.com/conferences/perfguild-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click to learn more</a></p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll join us at PerfGuild and make the rest of 2020 as performant as possible.</p>
