										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<h2><strong>Testing knowledge: the most underrated skill of an Automation Tester</strong></h2>
<p>People often come to me asking about the best way to start learning <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/03/26/automation-testing-for-beginners-ultimate-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer">test automation</a>. The gargantuan amount of tools, languages, frameworks and practices is overwhelming to anyone daring to look into the Automation abyss.</p>
<p>So, first of all, I will tell you something not-so-obvious: Automation Testing implies that you know about Testing. Yes, I know‚Ä¶ a lot of you think of it as something more related to development than testing. I can see why: without coding you can be pretty limited on your automation journey. But there is another truth, and that‚Äôs learning to code to automate and forget about Testing because you don‚Äôt need it that much now. Big mistake!</p>
<p>So, of course, as the first thing to start your automation journey, you need to <strong>have your testing foundations solid and thriving</strong>. Know the weak points of a system based on the technologies used, get that instinct that tells you where things will fail, learn the techniques and <strong>become an awesome <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/07/03/the-best-manual-test-case-templates/" rel="noopener noreferrer">manual tester</a></strong>. Then‚Ä¶ then you will be ready to take the next step of your Automation adventure.</p>
<h2><strong>Programming skills‚Ä¶ of course!</strong></h2>
<p>And this next step, in my opinion, is Object Oriented Programming. You know, most people start learning <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/category/selenium/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium</a> or other frameworks based on this tool as the very first thing when thinking about Automation. But this often comes with the skipping of the pillars of OOP. <strong>Inheritance</strong>, <strong>Encapsulation</strong>, <strong>Abstraction</strong> and <strong>Polymorphism</strong> should be concepts you are familiar with during your initial steps. This will help you understand why your syntax is highlighted in red on your IDE. Or why you can‚Äôt call a method you have created in another class. Once you <strong>understand how programming works at a basic level</strong>, lots of doors will open in front of you <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f6aa.png" alt="üö™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> You will be able to create solutions by yourself and won‚Äôt depend in copy-pasting answers from blogs until something works without truly understanding the work being done.</p>
<p>So, now we have covered Manual Testing and Object Oriented Programming skills. That‚Äôs a killer duo! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f431.png" alt="üê±" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&#x200d;<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f464.png" alt="üë§" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> And this is because pretty much any framework, tool and library you can come across will be like following a recipe being a chef <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f468-200d-1f373.png" alt="üë®‚Äçüç≥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />: You will know what they are talking about, understand the terms and why each tool does the stuff they do. You will have the knowledge to choose based on the needs of your application and not because ‚Äúit‚Äôs all I know‚Äù.</p>
<p>By following these steps, you will be ready to experiment with new ways to automate in no time. Is it in a different language? The conversion from one language to another is not a big deal! So don‚Äôt worry now about which one to pick, cause by knowing in depth the theory of one of them, you will be ready to tackle a new one really fast.</p>
<h2><strong>How can I get experience if I need it to start working as Automation Tester?</strong></h2>
<p>Well, there is a simple thing you can do right now: Start learning and start creating tests for webpages you use at home. Go ahead and download any framework of your choice, like the awesome <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a> right here, and go through the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> while you work hands on. Once you are confident with the results you are getting from the practice, you can suggest automating some manual tests in your project. One of the advantages of starting with a tool like TestProject is that it helps you create and, when you have the knowledge to, take a peep into how the code works <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="üëÄ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f525.png" alt="üî•" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>The better way to learn test automation is, after all, with practice. Don‚Äôt expect completing a course online and be an expert, because that‚Äôs something that comes with<strong> time, practice, failure (lots of it!) and experience</strong>. You will find the pleasure of experimenting with new frameworks and ways of achieving the same and new goals by exploring tools and libraries. Once you feel you know a fairly good amount of a specific tool, move to another, keep exploring, keep learning, because as we know, <strong>technologies change fast, and so does the world of automation testing</strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Don‚Äôt wait for an opportunity at work, you have all the means at home, on your computer! And with tools like <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a> (100% free), there was never a better time to start learning test automation!</p>
<p>You can start investing time right now on your Automation knowledge, but without forgetting your testing roots. <strong>Become an excellent tester first, then move to the code behind Automation and become the ultimate Automation tester! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="üí™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f451.png" alt="üëë" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>

<p>Apps ‚Äì what would life be without them? Imagine opening a brand-new browser tab every time you wanted to check your email, access photos, connect with friends on social media, or even pay your bills online.</p>
<p>Apps have greatly enhanced the way consumers interact with and complete tasks on their mobile devices. But what many consumers don‚Äôt realize is that they are tracked by many of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/consumer-threat-notices/faceapp/" rel="noopener noreferrer">apps</a> they know and use daily. Tracking can stem from a variety of platforms, however one type in particular has brought this issue even more into the forefront: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/07/1000961/launching-mittr-covid-tracing-tracker/" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact tracing apps</a>, which can help slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<h2>What Are Contact Tracing Apps?</h2>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/07/1000961/launching-mittr-covid-tracing-tracker/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT Technology Review</a>, technologists have been working to build contact tracing apps and systems to identify and notify those who have come in contact with a virus carrier. Tech giants and public health authorities worldwide have quickly signed up to build the application programming interfaces (APIs) and apps necessary to support this project‚Äôs scale. However, many users are skeptical that they know very little about these apps, what data is collected, and who this data is shared with.</p>
<p>The success of these contact tracing apps rests on user participation. However, for these apps to make a real impact, developers must overcome potential privacy and security risks to assure individuals their data will only be used to fight the virus‚Äô spread.</p>
<h2>The Impact of Contact Tracing Technology</h2>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://healthitsecurity.com/news/covid-19-contact-tracing-apps-spotlight-privacy-security-rights" rel="noopener noreferrer">Health IT Security</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://healthitsecurity.com/news/aclu-scientists-urge-privacy-focus-for-covid-19-tracing-technology" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Civil Liberties Union</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://healthitsecurity.com/news/eff-warns-covid-19-tracing-apps-pose-cybersecurity-privacy-risks" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> released reports outlining potential privacy and security risks developers should consider when building APIs and drafting privacy policies. Some of these risks include geo-location tracking or tracking a device‚Äôs location in real-time.</p>
<p>Then there‚Äôs user behavior to keep in mind. Some individuals may not understand the extent of the information they share with an app, while others are uneasy about the idea that the government ‚Äì or a hacker ‚Äì could easily access their whereabouts. What‚Äôs more, users are concerned that data collection will fail to end after the pandemic and authorities will use it in the future for unwarranted public surveillance.</p>
<p>While the privacy concerns around contact tracing apps are genuine, it‚Äôs also important to consider how this technology could greatly benefit public health. Although the privacy protection instilled in some apps is still a work-in-progress, some technologies have successfully contact traced without putting users‚Äô privacy at risk. For example, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2020-05-27/how-do-contact-tracing-apps-around-world-compare" rel="noopener noreferrer">Singapore‚Äôs app TraceTogether</a> only collects and gathers data at the point that someone 1) is confirmed to have COVID-19 and 2) consents to the scraping of that data. From there, the data is anonymized, encrypted, and doesn‚Äôt reveal the identity of the infected user or the person that may have come in contact with them. What‚Äôs more, the data is deleted automatically after 21 days.¬†By employing a thoughtful approach to contact tracing, positive strides can be made towards stopping the virus‚Äôs spread without risking user privacy.</p>
<h2>How to Stay Secure</h2>
<p>As a consumer living in a world riddled with uncertainty, you can take steps to help protect your digital life. When it comes to the rise of contact tracing technology and other apps you may use, here are some tips to consider to help safeguard your private information.</p>
<h3>Understand and read the terms</h3>
<p>Because this technology is relatively new, there is much to consider if you‚Äôre thinking about downloading a contact tracing app. Consumers can protect their privacy by reading the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service so they can know just what they‚Äôre dealing with.</p>
<h3>Update your settings</h3>
<p>If you‚Äôre concerned about an app having permission to access your location, photos, or other data, check your settings to see which apps have access to this information. Change permissions by either deleting the app or changing your settings on your device.</p>
<h3>Consider other options</h3>
<p>If you are not comfortable downloading a contact tracing app on your device but would like to be informed of the virus‚Äô spread, you can visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDC‚Äôs website for COVID-19 cases</a>, which can be narrowed down by state and county.</p>

<div>
<p>Media attention has¬†focused on the front-line heroes who are waging war <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/tags/pandemic" rel="noopener noreferrer">against the pandemic</a>, including¬†the¬†doctors, nurses, police officers, emergency medical technicians, and grocery store cashiers. But thousands of information technology professionals are also among the front-line troops in this battle.</p>
<p>IT pros are creating many of the applications used to gather and share critical data about the disease spread, or about financial help that individuals and organizations can tap to carry them through this unprecedented period.</p>
<p>Here are some of the interesting development projects going on around the world right now‚Äîand how you can get involved.</p>

<h3>The U.S. Digital Response</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The U.S. Digital Response</a> (USDR) is a coalition of volunteers, mostly technologists, looking to help solve the challenges that governments and government services face¬†in the midst of the¬†crisis.</p>
<p>Nearly 5,000 people have volunteered to help, and USDR¬†is currently¬†orchestrating¬†over 150 projects with state, city, county, and local governments, said¬†M. Jackson Wilkinson, the co-lead for the Real-Time Covid team at USDR. He oversees a team of 15, and among their efforts are CovidTracking, CovidActNow, PPE Coalition (personal protection equipment), and others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We typically dive into tricky internal data challenges to assist the governments of large cities and states. We try to quickly engage, get a handle on the problem, figure out a plan to close the gap, and hustle toward a solution.&#8221;<br />‚Äî<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/mjacksonw" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">M. Jackson Wilkinson</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes that&#8217;s building complete applications.¬†Other times it&#8217;s getting existing processes automated. And other times it&#8217;s just a few Zoom calls to provide¬†guidance.</p>
<p>Virtually all of¬†USDR projects arise from state or local government agencies reaching out for help, Wilkinson said.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of ways that software developers can make contributions to projects such as those helped by USDR, Wilkinson said. These include writing code, doing design work, conducting rapid user research, managing projects, or just basic data entry and cleansing.</p>
<h3>hack:now</h3>
<p>This year&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://hacknow.calhacks.io" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">hack:now</a> was a 36-hour global online competition for students to advance innovative and technical solutions aimed at tackling challenges caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Held April 24 and 25, 2020, the event was cosponsored by Postman, an API development¬†platform, and Cal Hacks, a nonprofit organization consisting of students who are passionate about fostering a culture of hacking.</p>
<p>The online hackathon was designed for the student community to work together and create solutions to trace, contain, and spread awareness about COVID-19, said¬†Abhinav Asthana, CEO and co-founder of Postman. Toward those goals, the hackathon focused on three tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health:</strong> &#8220;While we aren&#8217;t medical professionals, we can still find additional ways to empower healthcare workers on the front lines and bring support to individuals at home,&#8221; Asthana said.</li>
<li><strong>Community:</strong> &#8220;Digital communication is more important than ever, bringing together family, friends and neighbors, as well as saving local businesses while social distancing,&#8221;¬†Asthana said.</li>
<li><strong>Productivity:</strong> &#8220;Working or learning remotely is a novel experience for many of us. Millions of individuals stuck at home are looking for new ways to re-establish routines they had at work or school,&#8221; Asthana said.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the technical skills students learned and refined, the collaboration mindset and focus on the common good &#8220;will both influence these young developers&#8217;¬†careers and encourage continued efforts in this pandemic.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>

<h3>Coronavirus Tracker</h3>
<p>No doubt the most desired information about¬†COVID-19&#8217;s toll each day is the statistics on number of cases, death, recoveries and testings‚Äînationwide, on an individual state basis, and globally.</p>
<p>All of that information is readily available on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.domo.com/covid19/daily-pulse/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the Coronavirus Tracker</a>, maintained by Domo. It offers up-to-date information on the spread of disease, summarized by confirmed cases, geography, testing and treatment, projections, and economic impact. Domo,¬†a cloud computing business services provider, says it maintains the Coronavirus Tracker as a public service.¬†</p>
<p>The highly¬†detailed COVID-19 charts are compiled from information gathered every 10 minutes from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), John Hopkins University, Worldometer, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), the COVID Tracking Project, Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), <em>The New York Times</em>, the Wikipedia compilation of world testing, SafeGraph, Foursquare, Thumbtack, and data from the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Data Exchange.</p>
<p>Ben Schein, Domo&#8217;s vice president of data curiosity, explained how it came to be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Our team developed this interactive COVID-19 tracker over a weekend, building on Domo&#8217;s ability to rapidly bring together disparate new data sources and new data types and make it available at scale to anyone.&#8221;<br />‚Äî<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/benfromminn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ben Schein</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the goals was to give a broader context to the evolving pandemic,¬†Schein explained. This included adding data on such things as economic impact, individual mobility, foot traffic, hospitalization, and COVID-19 testing.</p>
<h3>India&#8217;s COVID-19 online hackathon</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://coronathon.in/?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTkRRek1UQTVaR0ptTW1WbSIsInQiOiJSemhVRlRrdlRSckFpclFSTW02b3B2cXBWM3NKaDVlczZvUzNVeXU2RnlUSDlWTlRXNGZNK1NmZUUyOEpxVXdcL0Z2ck1RNWJGK1JtSkY5S1M2Q052U1pjcEtwWEpybFF6OG1xVVZxbXlqYm5xb05EcktheDY1SE9Xck80OFBOMm0ifQ%3D%3D" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Coronathon India</a>, held in March and April, was another online contest designed to raise awareness about COVID-19 and develop weapons to be used in the fight against it. Some¬†3,000 people from India&#8217;s technology, business, and healthcare communities came together to build projects to minimize the pandemic&#8217;s impact on India.</p>
<p>Over a period of four weeks, more than 40 projects were developed to help track the spread of the disease, where hotspots of infection were developing, and how testing and tracing efforts were going. Hackathon organizers noted that COVID-19 poses¬†an especially grave danger to India, due to the country&#8217;s¬†high population density and the &#8220;abysmally low number of hospital beds per¬†100 people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of the developed projects came from software professionals and involved ways to better compile and analyze data about COVID-19 cases, or apps for tracking the movements of individuals known or suspected of being positive for the disease. Other projects involved social media tools for educating people about the disease symptoms and approved precautions against it.</p>
<h3>COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium</h3>
<p>In collaboration with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the US¬†Department of Energy, and many others, IBM helped launch <a target="_blank" href="https://covid19-hpc-consortium.org" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium</a>. The consortium is throwing an unprecedented amount of computing power‚Äî6 systems with more than 330 petaflops, 775,000 CPU cores, 34,000 GPUs, and counting‚Äîto help researchers¬†better understand the disease, its possible treatments, and potential cures.</p>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dario-gil-58575713/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dario Gil</a>, director of IBM research, the consortium represents a true &#8220;Who&#8217;s¬†Who&#8221; of supercomputing. Partners include the Lawrence Livermore National Lab, the Argonne National Lab, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the¬†Sandia National Laboratory, the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the National Science Foundation, NASA, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and several leading technology companies.</p>
<p>Through this program, researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the University of Tennessee¬†screened 8,000 compounds &#8220;to find those that are most likely to bind to the main &#8216;spike&#8217;¬†protein of the coronavirus, rendering it unable to infect host cells,&#8221;¬†Gil said.</p>
<p>They then¬†recommended the 77 most promising small-molecule drug compounds that could now be tested.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;This is the power of accelerating discovery through computation.&#8221;<br />‚Äî<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dario-gil-58575713/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dario Gil</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Graph4Good</h3>
<p>Graph data science is an important part of the efforts to track the spread of COVID-19 and the movements of those who may have been infected. In response, database vendor Neo4j launched <a target="_blank" href="https://neo4j.com/graphs4good/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the Graphs4Good project</a>, which uses the vendor&#8217;s graph database to research COVID-19.</p>
<p>The advantage of using graph data technology in the fight against COVID-19 is that it can¬†connect large datasets from multiple sources, allowing analysis on a much larger level.</p>
<p>Graphs4Good &#8220;has helped several organizations tackle pandemic-related initiatives from contact tracing, to curtailing the spread of misinformation,&#8221; said Amy E. Hodler, director of AI and analytics programs at Neo4j.</p>
<p>Current market conditions demonstrate the blind spots of thinking about data in rows and columns, she added.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Organizations are beginning to consider the importance of the relationships between data points, which are potentially far more valuable for predictive accuracy than flat, tabular descriptors.&#8221;<br />‚Äî<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/amyhodler" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amy E. Hodler</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Call for Code</h3>
<p>IBM is encouraging developers to join in the fight with its¬†<a target="_blank" href="https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Call for Code</a>¬†program. It offers¬†cash¬†prizes,¬†connects¬†developers with experts and open-source resources, and helps deploy applications where they are most needed.</p>
<p>Now in its third year, the 2020 Call for Code Global Challenge is currently asking developers worldwide to build solutions for COVID-19.¬†A second track this year looks at issues related to climate change. Both the COVID-19 track and the Climate Change track are open for submissions though July 31.</p>
<p>Response to the initial call was swift. &#8220;We&#8217;re already receiving overwhelming support and some exciting early ideas,&#8221;¬†said Willie Tejada, general manager and chief developer advocate at IBM. In a single day, over 1,000 developers¬†registered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;First responders, at-risk individuals, and coders are reaching out to us to share their experiences and brainstorm solutions.&#8221;<br />‚Äî<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/wtejada223" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Willie Tejada</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Together with Call for Code&#8217;s creator, David Clark Cause, and in partnership with the United Nations Human Rights Council and the Linux Foundation, &#8220;we&#8217;re asking developers, data scientists, and problem solvers to answer the call.&#8221;</p>
<h3>The next wave of projects and volunteers</h3>
<p>From supercomputer analysis¬†to major data management projects¬†to individual developer efforts, the coronavirus pandemic is inspiring an unprecedented response from IT professionals and tech companies that want to join the fight on the front lines.</p>
<p>Technology¬†pros who want¬†to join the fight should look first¬†in their own state.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Undoubtedly, Selenium has made web testing far simpler for many QA teams and enterprises worldwide, but it has a fair share of challenges. That being said, most of such issues testers encounter have quite clear-cut solutions, which is why we have summarized some of the common Selenium automation testing challenges, along with their solution. Let‚Äôs get started!</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a target="_blank" id="mobile-application-testing" rel="noopener noreferrer">1. Mobile Application Testing</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When using <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/category/selenium/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium</a>, we can create <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/03/07/what-test-cases-should-you-automate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">automated test cases</a> on any operating system and browser on desktop, however we cannot perform mobile tests with Selenium simultaneously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Solution</em></strong><strong>: </strong>You can make use of tools like <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/02/05/the-best-appium-tools-for-mobile-developers/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Appium mobile app automation tool</a> to handle iOS and Android applications utilizing the WebDriver protocol. As more and more users are opting for mobile devices, it‚Äôs no surprise that testers and developers are taking benefits of the Appium‚Äôs functionalities for this purpose.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2757.png" alt="‚ùó" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> There are also tools such as <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a>, based on both Selenium and Appium, and thus providing a great solution for such scenarios in which you need to test web as well as mobile applications. Definitely check out this speed benchmark when considering mobile automation testing tools: <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/04/08/fastest-mobile-automation-testing-tool-appium-vs-xcuitest-vs-testproject-vs-uiautomator-vs-espresso/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fastest Mobile Automation Testing Tool ‚Äì Appium vs. XCUITest vs. TestProject vs. UiAutomator vs. Espresso</a>.</p>
<h3><strong><a target="_blank" id="reporting" rel="noopener noreferrer">2. Reporting</strong></h3>
<p>Reporting is considered as one of the major challenges faced during Selenium automation testing, since Selenium does not support effective reporting on its own. You can use various packages or third-party tools such as <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/10/31/the-power-of-testng-test-next-generation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestNG</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/07/16/python-test-automation-project-using-pytest/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pytest</a>, etc‚Ä¶ However, such options require one to have advanced programming skills, and they are not always elaborate enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Solution</em></strong>: With <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a> you can create detailed reports on the fly, without the need to explicitly mention any the reporting steps in your Selenium code or recordings, and without any additional tools required. It‚Äôs all taken care of for you, and you get <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/beautiful-test-analytics/" rel="noopener noreferrer">in-depth reports</a> with all the necessary insights and trends needed to troubleshoot your automation testing and measure the product‚Äôs quality.</p>
<h3><strong><a target="_blank" id="alerts" rel="noopener noreferrer">3. Pop-up Windows and Alerts </strong></h3>
<p>We often receive prompt or confirmation pop-up alerts during test automation, yet Selenium often fails to catch such pop-ups. It can be the trickiest job to automate such alerts to either close or accept them. Selenium does not have the capability to handle windows-based alerts, since they are components of the OS instead of the browser. However, Selenium WebDriver does have the ability to handle web-based alerts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Solution</em></strong><strong>:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/06/30/selenium-4-new-window-tab-screenshots/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium WebDriver</a> can operate varied windows. Web-based alerts can commonly be handled with the <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/06/18/selenium-switch-methods-chapter-5/" rel="noopener noreferrer">switchTo method</a> to control the pop-up while allowing the browser to run in the background.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To manage any sort of alert popup, you can also apply a getAlert function. Prior to running the script, you should import a package that can create a WebDriver script to handle alerts. The capable interface brings with it the subsequent commands: <em>void accept (), void dismiss(), getText(), void sendKeys(String stringToSend)</em>. The first two click the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù &amp; ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù buttons on pop-up windows.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a target="_blank" id="page-load" rel="noopener noreferrer">4. Page load</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some pages load various elements depending on the distinct user behavior and journey. Sometimes some elements come into view based past actions the user makes. For instance, if you choose a nation from dropdown lists, then cities related that specific nation will load in the cities dropdown. While executing the Selenium test, the script may not be able to tolocate the element.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Solution</em></strong><strong>: </strong>To resolve this specific issue we can use explicit waits in the Selenium script to provide elements with sufficient time to upload and to locate the element. You can also check out TestProject‚Äôs <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/05/04/testproject-adaptive-wait-capability/" rel="noopener noreferrer">adaptive wait capability</a> and make sure to avoid any test flakiness.</p>
<h3><strong><a target="_blank" id="scalability" rel="noopener noreferrer">5. Scalability</strong></h3>
<p>Even though Selenium gives you the capability to test on any browser or operating system, it‚Äôs still restricted in how many tests it can run at once and how rapidly it can perform them. Without a Selenium grid, you can only execute one test after the other. <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/07/16/using-selenium-grid-and-remote-webdrivers/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium Grid</a> can scale your test procedure with the use of remote WebDrivers, and enables running tests in parallel. However, you can‚Äôt test your web application across multiple combinations of browsers &amp; OS. You can only execute tests on a specific OS and browser (installed on your machine) at a time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Solution</em></strong>: You can use cloud testing solutions (TestProject has built-in integrations with <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-integrations/sauce-labs-integration" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sauce Labs</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-integrations/browserstack-integration" rel="noopener noreferrer">BrowserStack</a>), to test your apps across multiple OS and browsers all at the same time. You might find this comparison article of 5 cloud solutions interesting to review: <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/02/04/top-5-solutions-executing-test-automation-cloud-comprehensive-comparison/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 5 Solutions for Executing Test Automation in the Cloud (Comprehensive Comparison)</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a target="_blank" id="desktop-apps" rel="noopener noreferrer">6. Desktop Application Testing</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the major challenges faced in <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/03/26/automation-testing-for-beginners-ultimate-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer">automation testing</a>.<strong>¬†</strong>Selenium does not support windows-based <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2016/12/22/9-free-desktop-test-automation-tools/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Desktop test automation</a>. It supports only web-based applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Solution</em></strong><strong>: </strong>Not exactly a solution, but we need to keep in mind that Selenium can‚Äôt automate every single thing. There are still some kinds of tasks you need to implement on a manual basis. Thus, as described already above, it is critical to have an understanding of programming languages for using a tool like Selenium.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a target="_blank" id="conclusion" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Selenium automated testing can be tricky, but is without a doubt the king of web testing <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f451.png" alt="üëë" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> While automated test cases undoubtedly allow for rapid identification and resolution of problems within an app‚Äôs codebase, the challenges are not that easy to be tackled. Thus, additional tools or methods need to be taken into consideration and implemented accordingly.</p>
