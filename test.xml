</p>
<div>
<p>Joan Rivers once wrote, “I don’t want to order dinner by yelling into a plastic clown’s mouth”. We’ll get back to that shortly.</p>
<p>There is a compelling discussion to have about creating a dedicated team to “do all the automation”. Why not have all the automation developers or SDETs be on one team? After all, automation creation is a special skill like database administration and CI/CD/CT pipeline management, so shouldn’t we treat automators for testing in the same way? We can just hand them the requirements or acceptance criteria and they can bang out those automation scripts for us.</p>
<p>Some call the above situation the <em>automation drive-thru</em>; it’s an apt analogy. Like a fast-food drive-thru, you simply decide what you want to order, yell your order into a clown’s mouth, pay some fee, then get your food from the window. No muss, no fuss. Can’t automation development be similar?  Instead of a greasy burger, some chicken nuggets, or some delicious tacos, out comes an automated test script; again, no muss, no fuss, right? Sadly, it doesn’t always work out with no muss or fuss.</p>
<p>The drive-thru is but one way to organize teams for automation; there are, however, three ways: the dedicated automation team, the distributed automation team, and the hybrid approach.</p>
<p>Let’s explore!</p>
<h2 id="h.xpvxmlms6ppg"><strong>What Does A Dedicated Automation Team Look Like?</strong></h2>
<p>I know of an organization in a Fortune 500 company that had (and perhaps still has) a dedicated team that creates their automation for at least one organization. Putting snark aside, the dedicated automation team was the working, professional, effective version of the automation drive-thru. This team would take in requests to create automation scripts based on test cases and then create automated scripts that would (give or take) do what was prescribed based on the test cases. In general, I would dismiss this as folly; no sufficiently experienced testing professional could think this was a good working model. But, they did, and it was. This organization was producing quality automation with actual value. The organization was succeeding. I know this because I was well acquainted with their former leader and with several of their automation engineers.</p>
<h3 id="h.4tb3yqvyj1om"><strong>Dedicated Team Advantages</strong></h3>
<p>The main advantages of the dedicated team are the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/critical%20mass" rel="noopener noreferrer">critical mass</a> of automation expertise and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/economy%20of%20scale" rel="noopener noreferrer">economy of scale</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding <em>critical mass</em>, if you have all the automation expertise in one place, the automation endeavor has less friction when it comes to helping one another conquer automation challenges and deliver new automation capabilities. New automation engineers can be brought up to speed quickly because they have the rest of the automation team “at arm’s reach”. The walls between who automates what don’t need to exist (except when funding comes into play, but, to quote <a target="_blank" href="https://altonbrown.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alton Brown</a>, that’s another show).</p>
<p>Following from, and dependent on, critical mass is the ability to gain an economy of scale. The <em>Economy of scale</em>, for our purposes, is being more productive, efficient, effective, and therefore economical in the delivery of automation. Speaking practically, this means that there is a consistency that can be attained by having a dedicated automation team and that consistency can scale because of the critical mass and consistency. The dedicated team can be indoctrinated with the organization standards and the organization can preside over the guidelines; automation, regardless of framework or library, can be implemented based on a consistent ideology. When implemented judiciously, this approach can deliver economic gains to the organization and the company.</p>
<h3 id="h.dvwkrai2iojn"><strong>Dedicated Team Limitations</strong></h3>
<p>As is said, into every life some rain must fall. The main downside to a dedicated automation team is that the team, while experts in automation, likely lacks detailed domain knowledge. Of course, the automation team knows the basic operation of the system under test, but most current applications are large, distributed, multiple-serviced entities. It’s not realistic for a relatively small team of automation developers to be “sufficiently versed” in the esoterica of how each subsystem works; the details eventually get too small for this team to keep up. The limitation is further strained when the dedicated team is expected to provide automation across heterogeneous application environments. Having worked in an organization that was responsible for producing automation across disparate applications, I can attest that a lack of domain knowledge was a challenge to the value proposition.</p>
<h2 id="h.r7h2am996zom"><strong>What Does A Distributed Team Look Like?</strong></h2>
<p>Spinning 180 degrees from a dedicated automation team, we have the distributed automation team. Generally, a <em>distributed automation team</em> falls into one of three categories: in-team automation specialists, testers/QAs do the automation, developers do the automation.</p>
<p>In the case of <em>automation specialists</em>, often called software development engineers in test (SDETS) or quality engineers (QE), the name describes the role. The automation specialists only do that: automation. In the microcosm, we have that economy of scale and specialization, but it’s a relatively small economy in the scope of the overall company because it’s exclusive to the team on which the automation specialists work; this is especially true if the company has many, similar delivery teams. In this team implementation, the automation specialists are not testers/QAs; they work with the testers/QAs as well as the developers to develop the automation that helps the team be more effective or more efficient at testing.</p>
<p>It’s a great story to say that the <em>testers/QAs do the automation</em>. They automate instead of “doing it manually” and the team “goes faster”. To accomplish this approach, the testers/QAs need to have time to gain the skills necessary for automation; they also need the time to create and maintain the automation. Often, the <em>whole team does automation</em> variant can be more effective. In this model, the automation work, like other work, is not assigned to one role; anyone on the team with the appropriate skill set is empowered to perform or help with any task. Developers know how to program so they can be a natural fit to create automation or pair with a tester to create automation.</p>
<p>A third, and recently hot, approach is “we don’t need testers” because we can have the <em>developers do the automation</em>. This has a direct correlation to the testers/QAs do the automation approach, namely that automation is something you “just do” without training or special skills; since automation is programming and developers know how to program, it’s a natural fit for them. Like testers, however, developers need time to gain the appropriate skills to appropriately implement automation.</p>
<h3 id="h.6nbsm161v46e"><strong>Advantages</strong></h3>
<p>Since the automators, whoever they happen to be, can focus their implementations on the app or app area on which their team works, they can have deep domain knowledge of the software. This allows the automators, and therefore the automation, to be very specific and specialized in the automation they create. Since the automation software doesn’t have to be generalized across all application teams, there can be some cost savings in some cases; the automaton software, the frameworks and reusable libraries, in particular, don’t have to be all things to everyone so the automation can be created faster and likely at a lower cost.</p>
<p>Additionally, the deep domain knowledge enables the automators to discover hence unthought-of paths in the code that merit testing. This is difficult-to-impossible without the deep domain knowledge this approach permits.</p>
<p>Distributed automation teams are especially appropriate when the teams are working disparate products where there is little-to-no overlap between the application or system technologies.</p>
<h3 id="h.3ur7mf8q0tt1"><strong>Limitations</strong></h3>
<p>If <em>automation specialists</em> are creating the automation, these automators are often over-burdened or under-utilized. If there’s too much automation to create, not all of it gets created. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it can be sub-optimal if critical or high-value automation can’t be implemented simply because the team “doesn’t have time”. Conversely, if there’s “not enough” automation work to fully occupy the automators, they may be idle and the team loses potential value.</p>
<p>That’s OK, let’s “just” have the <em>testers/QAs do automation</em>. Bzzt, play again. There is an unfortunate perception that automation is something that you “just do”. I just brush my teeth, I just eat lunch, I just run some test cases, and I just create some automation. As much as it would be great if this were true, it’s just not. What typically happens is that the testers/QAs are “tasked” with automation with little-to-no guidance or training and this effort is heaped on top of their existing work, which continues to grow; when was the last time a team released a new version of their software with fewer features? Unless the organization is tolerant of a “let’s slow down now to go faster later” strategy, this approach is fraught with peril and the likely outcome will be “automation can’t work here”.</p>
<p><em>Developers do the automation</em> has a similar issue. Leadership wants this to happen with negligible impact to effort estimates even in the short term. For teams that can’t embrace the “let’s slow down now to go faster later” strategy, one of two outcomes is usually the result. One outcome is that the created automation is largely confirmatory; the automation shows that the software can work under very specific conditions and other conditions are not accounted for; the developers are often required to perform heroic efforts to accomplish even this due to needing to attain an on-time delivery. The other outcome is that automation takes “too long” so it doesn’t work here, and the automation endeavor is abandoned.</p>
<p>If the automation creation is truly distributed, it is difficult or impossible for the teams to leverage each other’s work. Even the most well-meaning teams that try to develop cooperatively will have trouble doing so in a consistent manner. The incentive for the individual teams is to achieve the goals set for those teams. This work is not purposely completed to the detriment of the other team, but there is usually little-to-no incentive for teams to cooperate at that level. Senior leadership is usually not thrilled to pin their organization’s success on the “goodwill” of another team; similarly, those same leaders are not likely to jeopardize their organization’s success by spending some of their team’s cycles to help another team’s automation implementation if the need comes at a critical time.</p>
<p>If code sharing is still desired, some of the hard dependencies can be mitigated by having a shared codebase, something like an “internal open source” repository. The primary challenge there is when conflicting changes are made to the shared code. How is that conflict resolved? Often, even in the best-intentioned companies, organizational incentives and directives reign so the teams agree to fork the shared automation repository with the well-intended agreement to merge after the next business milestone. Sadly, that seldom happens; there’s always another business milestone.</p>
<h2 id="h.n0ijeftvftn7"><strong>The Hybrid Approach – An Oft-Appropriate Middle Ground</strong></h2>
<p>So, let’s split the difference, shall we?</p>
<p>As noted above, there are advantages and disadvantages to each of the preceding approaches. What if we meld the two? Let’s take the strengths of each team layout and attempt to mitigate the disadvantages. The goal is to let each of the disciplines focus on its strengths.</p>
<p>In this approach, the automation development is divided into two competencies: the base team and the distributed teams.</p>
<h3 id="h.7t0zz298japi"><strong>The Base Team</strong></h3>
<p>The base team is responsible for all the shared infrastructure. Need a wrapper around Selenium’s WebElement? The base team handles that. Need an encapsulation around Microsoft’s API library? The base team handles that, too. Need some helper functions to reduce the effort required to create or maintain automation? That’s right, the base team handles that.</p>
<p>The base team comprises experienced automation developers who are in the best position to provide a general framework, platform, and infrastructure for automation creation. The base team is also tasked with the training, coaching, and guidance of the teams implementing the actual automation.</p>
<p>It’s also responsible for coaching on the appropriate practices for the company. This team is trained in automation strategy, implementation, and theory. They provide the base infrastructure implementation and many, if not all, of the shared components used across the distributed teams but they understand and can coach on the theory behind the strategy and implementation.</p>
<h3 id="h.ybgh72o25dkm"><strong>The Distributed Teams</strong></h3>
<p>The distributed teams consume and exploit the value provided by the base team. They are domain experts who have intimate knowledge of the software being tested and of how to use the shared automation created by the base team. This is the team that writes the automation that helps the testers.</p>
<h3 id="h.u4kftvqyn41a"><strong>Risks</strong></h3>
<p>This is not a panacea.</p>
<p>If the base team isn’t staffed with enough appropriate people to service all of the distributed teams, the base team will become a bottleneck, actually impeding progress instead of facilitating it. If getting enough appropriate base team staff members is a challenge, the previously mentioned internal open-source model can be valuable. This model has a higher chance of success with a base team than with a purely distributed model because the base team is the steward of the shared code. Care must be taken, however, to avoid the next risk.</p>
<p>A dedicated base team runs the risk of becoming or at least being viewed as an <em><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_tower" rel="noopener noreferrer">ivory tower</a></em>, i.e., delivering intellectual solutions and directives as opposed to practical and workable ones. One way to mitigate this risk is to give the base team a directive to be collaborative as opposed to dictatorial, conversations as opposed to edicts. Another way is to include members of the distributed team as stakeholders, which they indeed are, in any prioritization and feature creation discussions.</p>
<p>Sadly, as in many other corporate aspects, politics often play a role when organizing a base team. The base team is seen as strategic: whoever controls the base team owns their own automation destiny. When one application team or organization controls the base team, the non-controlling teams and organizations are at a disadvantage when conflicts arise or when the controlling team must make difficult business decisions. One way to mitigate this situation is to organize the base team in a “shared services” organization, such as the organization that houses IT and security.</p>
<h2 id="h.hjr12jrszzq7"><strong>Recommendations?</strong></h2>
<p>There’s not really a wrong way to organize an automation team. The key is to be appropriate; let the context of what the company and organizations need and will tolerate. The hybrid team can be very powerful and has most of the advantages of both the dedicated team and the distributed team approaches. That said, the hybrid approach is not appropriate for every company or organization. There is a large amount of trust and some organizational overhead with this approach; there’s also a funding facet. Choose an appropriate approach then be prepared to evolve if the initial choice becomes inappropriate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />

<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>Retired Marine fighter pilot and Top Gun instructor Dave Berke said “Every single thing you do in your life, every decision you make, is an OODA Loop.” OODA Loop? Observe–Orient–Decide–Act, the “OODA Loop” was originally developed by United States Air Force Colonel John Boyd and outlines that fundamentally all actions are first based on observations.  If you can’t first observe you are at a serious disadvantage. This can be applied at every scale from planning a large-scale military invasion, to changing lanes on a highway or even down to the split-second decision of picking up a glass of water off a table. But it all starts with observation.</p>
<p>If observation or information about what’s around us is so important, then it’s no surprise that tools and devices that can provide us information not only increase our success but also make us feel more comfortable. The personal robot called temi, is such a device. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3809114,00.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">With 1,000 new devices being created a month</a>, temi can help us see a loved one in the hospital through teleconferencing, escort us to the ballroom in the hotel we are staying at or help a doctor virtually visit with a patient. In fact, across Israel, temi was recently selected as the de facto robotics platform for hospital telepresence. Temi can allow us to observe and interact remotely; all while influencing what we decide to do next with the information we have learned.</p>
<p>But what are the risks associated with tools that help provide greater information into our OODA Loop? How could someone with malicious intent use tools like temi to improve their OODA Loop, furthering their ability to cause harm? Could someone control temi without the owner’s permission? What if someone could turn on the camera and microphone and see the robot’s surroundings while listening to your medical diagnosis or treatment plan? What if someone could “check in on your kids” and map out your house without your permission? These are the type of questions that McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) aims to answer when we see a product like temi. We look at technologies and the wealth of information they provide through the lens of an attacker; with the goal of making your experience a safer one. So, it is no surprise that our team decided to take a deeper look into temi when it was first released.</p>
<p>On day one, like a kid during Christmas, we unboxed our shiny new temi with a sense of joy and excitement. Like your average user, we set it up following the included directions, had it follow us around dressed up as a ghost for Halloween, marked key locations, made video calls and were amazed at just how cool this robot was! Maybe a little less like your average user, we also captured all the network traffic while temi showed off and did a firmware update. We also looked at what open network ports temi exposed, decompiled the Android application, activated android debugger (adb) and installed a ssh server, just to be safe.  Basically, we treated temi like your child’s first date in high school – we did a background check and used proper intimidation techniques before we allowed temi to go on a date.</p>
<p>Over the next several months, we really dug into what we learned from our “first date” with temi. What we discovered, not unlike some of my first high school dates, is temi had some trust issues. This is not a good report card considering some of temi’s primary functions. For the ability to make video calls and to remotely control temi securely, it’s important to keep information used to connect to a call secret and secured. Since temi had some flaws doing so, the team turned its attention to the question of whether these “character flaws” could be exploited.</p>
<p>It turned out with only a few modifications to the original temi Android application, we could intercept phone calls intended for another user. With a few more modifications, temi began to trust us (the attacker) to navigate it around and activate the camera and microphone. Additionally, we discovered the only knowledge an attacker would need to know about the victim is their phone number. Yes, the same number you can’t figure out how tele-markers got ahold of was the information a malicious actor would need to access your temi completely remotely without your knowledge or consent.</p>
<p>For an attacker, temi’s security flaws allows them to feed vital information into their OODA Loop. Consider a hospital that keeps a very tight and well-run information security program. From the outside they are almost impossible to steal information from. The vulnerabilities discovered in temi now provide them a way to gather information about the internal operations of the business without needing to crack the well implemented business network or physical security. With the phone number of anyone who has called a temi recently, an attacker could observe what room number and condition a hospitalized member of congress is in. Temi could watch the security guard type in the building alarm code. Temi could observe the dog pictures on the nurse’s desk labeled with its cute name and birthday, that just happens to also be part of their password. This information can be invaluable to an attacker’s OODA loop and the potentially malicious decisions they make. Temi was a challenging target to compromise, but the nature of the flaws discovered highlight the importance of this research and the value of vendors to provide fast and effective mitigations, as was the case here.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy punishing themselves with an excessive amount of technical detail of these vulnerabilities, we have a special treat for you in our highly technical paper on this research <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/call-an-exorcist-my-robots-possessed/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. This dives into the vulnerability discovery and exploitation process from start to finish in intricate detail.</p>
<p>In keeping with our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/threat-center/advanced-threat-research/disclosure.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">responsible disclosure program</a>, we reached out to temi as soon as we confirmed that the vulnerabilities we discovered were exploitable. Temi was very receptive, grateful, and had a strong desire to improve the security of temi. Over the next several weeks, we worked closely with their team to develop a more robust solution for temi. For each vulnerability, we provided temi with two mitigations strategies; a band aid and a cure. It is common for vendors to only implement the band aid or quick fix solution. To their credit, temi took on the challenge of implementing the more effective solution or the cure for all findings. Once in place, we were able to test and confirm that all the vulnerabilities reported were effectively mitigated. It is always exciting to see the positive impact security research can have when responsible disclosure is valued by vendor and researchers alike. The following demo video is a light-hearted way to show the true possible impact of the remote accessibility component of this research, had these been found by adversaries instead of responsibly disclosed by McAfee ATR and fixed by temi.</p>
<p><div class="fitvids-video"><iframe title="McAfee ATR illustrates the impact of temi vulnerabilities" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7aYURVzcL2c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</p>
<p>So, what is the larger lesson here? I would venture to guess that I wouldn’t be the first to conclude that Colonel John Boyd was a smart man and his theory of the OODA Loop is not only effective but also strengthens a process – in this case, vulnerability mitigation. For our research, this applies directly to a personal robot assistant which is currently being used worldwide, across a wide range of industries, and currently producing nearly 1,000 new units a month. McAfee’s ATR team <em>observed</em> a new impactful technology emerging into the market. Due to our previous experiences and technical expertise we were well <em>oriented</em> in a position where we <em>decided</em> to take further <em>action </em>and investigate. Temi <em>observed</em> the value in collaboration, <em>oriented</em> themselves in a position where they could <em>decide</em> to take <em>action</em> in making a tool used for <em>observation</em> a more secure product.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Behavior-driven development (BDD) is an agile development process that encourages teams to share tools and a process to collaborate on]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>Behavior-driven development (BDD) is an agile development process that encourages teams to share tools and a process to collaborate on software development projects across developers, QA folks, and business stakeholders. Sounds good, right? I mean, who wouldn’t want to be more collaborative and transparent with all project stakeholders? I believe there is tremendous value in this type of approach. </p>
<p>However, people choose to use BDD tools for many different reasons—and in my experience, they’re often the wrong reasons. In certain cases, BDD tools are likely to do more harm than good. Can you be successful with BDD tools? Yes. But often, how it <i>should </i>work doesn’t reflect how it usually <i>does </i>work.</p>
<p>The overall theme of my talks is to figure out ways to make your testing initiatives more difficult to fail. It is important to keep things simple with fewer moving parts and more and useful abstractions. BDD tools generally fail when it comes to making things easier to maintain.</p>
<p>I recently hosted a STP webinar called “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.softwaretestpro.com/the-hidden-costs-of-bdd-tools/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hidden Costs of BDD Tools</a>.” I shared my views on how the allure of using Cucumber or other “Given/When/Then” code wrappers seems greater than ever, but that there is a fairly narrow path to success. In the webinar, I talked about the various reasons why people choose to use BDD tools as well as what the reality looks like for many companies. I also revealed some of the inherent underlying issues with BDD tooling, including why teams so often end up in trouble when using them, and discussed some alternatives for how to get the most out of your UI testing. If you’re interested in BDD, it’s worth your time to watch the webinar. </p>
<p>As you can imagine, BDD can be a hot topic! We got many questions and were only able to get to a few of them during the live event, so I decided to take some of the other questions and answer them right here in this handy blog post. You can also check out some of the conversations with these questions on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TitusOnBDD" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>. </p>
<p><b>What is your suggestion for how to best get started using the BDD approach? </b></p>
<p>If you don’t know how or why to use a BDD tool: don’t use it. If you want to practice BDD, first you need to make sure your manager, product team and developers are all on board. </p>
<p><b>Have you found any good tools/frameworks that provide documentation outside of relying on the &#8220;Clean Code&#8221; (code is readable) perspective?</b></p>
<p>That really depends on what you are trying to document. I’d love to have “Backward BDD” tooling that generates the information people are interested in from the code, rather than having the user do it from the other direction. </p>
<p><b>Any suggestions on how to &#8220;undo&#8221; a BDD setup?</b></p>
<p>First, copy/paste the actual code into methods. Next, abstract out anything imperative into Page and Data Objects. </p>
<p><b>The BDD tool worked great because there was no deep expertise on coding and I think Cucumber provides a layer (non-business) that allows them to be more effective. </b></p>
<p>The only problem is that these tools don’t avoid the need to write good code. That still has to happen. If your goal is to give less technical people busywork, sure; but this will not  improve your test strategy.</p>
<p><b>What would be a non-BDD alternative to a Screenplay pattern promoted by Serenity BDD? </b></p>
<p>I’ve never seen an example, but would be interested in seeing one. Also, I prefer Atomic/Autonomous/Short DOM to Database tests which PO pattern supports and Screenplay does not.</p>
<p><b>I also have seen all sorts of wrong usage of BDD, but TBH&#8230; I&#8217;ve also seen that elsewhere.</b></p>
<p>Definitely important to keep in mind that browser automation is hard! Selenium provides some specific challenges that require domain knowledge and technical prowess to address. </p>
<p><b>What&#8217;s the difference between Cucumber and Gauge?</b></p>
<p>The difference is I haven’t used Gauge before. My BDD tooling talk applies to any software that does some form of translating English language to code.</p>
<p><b>What is your preferred alternative to the flexibility of Cucumber&#8217;s tags for running various subsets of tests? What&#8217;s your preferred alternative for the functionality Cucumber&#8217;s profiles provide?</b></p>
<p>This functionality will vary based on Test Runner. RSpec definitely supports these things in Ruby; I would be surprised if most test runners in other languages did not have similar functionality. </p>
<p><b>Can you give an example of when you&#8217;ve seen BDD tools used successfully where they  provide real value?</b></p>
<p>Depends on what you mean by “success” and “real value.” I mentioned the scenario of a consultant providing “agile transformation” within a company/team being useful, but that’s a specific (and temporary) context.</p>
<p><b>What is your thought for data testing in capturing these requirements?</b></p>
<p>Data Driven Testing doesn’t belong in a DOM to Database test. Make sure the form works, then any investigation into what the data entry does in your system should be at a lower level.</p>
<p><b>What tool do you recommend for data testing to capture requirements?</b></p>
<p>A REST client in the language of your choice.</p>
<p><b>How do you feel about [the Geb/Spock] implementation of BDD over Cucumber  (i.e. where the feature file is not separate, but is the outline for the test case implementation)?</b></p>
<p>I’m definitely a fan of distinguishing between Arrange, Act and Assert statements; so long as it isn’t doing natural language translation it sounds great.</p>
<p><b>Is it possible to develop a tool that is more like a wizard that guides you through the process?</b></p>
<p>There are codeless solutions out there, but most of what I’ve seen only handles the easier use cases and generates its own maintenance costs. One of them might be “good enough” for what you need.</p>
<p><b> For a tester who is trying to bridge the manual to automation gap&#8230;where to start? Many job listings mention Cucumber-Gherkin.</b></p>
<p>Manual testers who only know how to write Gherkin statements won’t have great job security, in my opinion. There really isn’t a way to escape the need for writing good code, so your best bet is to find resources to become a good developer in the first place.</p>
<p>###</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Many teams are decomposing their work into a hierarchy of epic, feature, user story, and task. The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) has made this hierarchy popular, but many teams that have never looked at that model are using the same structure.</p>
<p>The idea is great. <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/confused-about-safe-epics-follow-real-world-example" rel="noopener noreferrer">Epics produce big valuable products or big valuable changes</a> to products. You decompose them into smaller chunks of value so you can <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb/high-perf-continuous-delivery?lx=-DC2cJ&amp;custom_url=continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">deliver solutions to your customers sooner</a> than waiting for a big-bang solution at the end.</p>
<p>Features are decomposed into high-value stories, which, according to definition, should provide value in production as well, and again it occurs faster than building a whole feature.</p>
<p>But there is a hidden anti-pattern in the way teams are <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/agile-strategy-how-go-projects-products-3-steps" rel="noopener noreferrer">decomposing work into an epic-feature-story hierarchy</a>.</p>
<p>Teams use agile tools to manage epics, features, stories, and tasks. But they too often use them to articulate a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure#:~:text=A%20work%2Dbreakdown%20structure%20(WBS,team%27s%20work%20into%20manageable%20sections." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">work breakdown structure (WBS)</a> instead of a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_breakdown_structure#:~:text=A%20work%20breakdown%20structure%20(WBS,components%20of%20the%20final%20product." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">value breakdown structure (VBS)</a>.</p>
<p>WBS refers to the common, age-old <a target="_blank" href="https://www.workbreakdownstructure.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">project-management practice</a> of breaking tasks into smaller chunks, allowing teams to estimate time and costs for completion. VBS, instead, focuses on <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/node/3827" rel="noopener noreferrer">product delivery and sub-products</a>, not tasks and sub-tasks.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to make this critical switch in thinking.</p>
<h3>WBS thinking results in poor user stories</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s the epic-feature-story hierarchy:</p>
<p><em>Figure 1. The epic-feature-story hierarchy. Source: Scaled Agile, Inc.</em></p>
<p>All too often, teams use these three types as containers for big tasks, medium tasks, and smaller tasks—just as with Microsoft Project years ago. But that leads to poorly written user stories.</p>
<p>Badly written stories have been around basically forever. The two most common poor-stories patterns are horizontal slices and lifecycle slices. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizontal slice: Create a table in the database for &#8220;New API&#8221;</li>
<li>Lifecycle slice: Design &#8220;New API&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many reasons these are poor stories, but in the context of WBS and VBS, the key problem is that they are items of work, not items of value. (There are many resources for <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/agile-leaders-guide-writing-user-stories" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to write great user stories</a>, so there&#8217;s no need to repeat that here.)</p>
<p>WBS has been used to plan development work for a long time, so it is deeply embedded in our muscle memory. And when we were project-driven, this was a great technique.</p>
<p>But with the movement away from project culture and toward product culture, this technique no longer works well. You need to think in terms of product delivery.</p>
<h3>Retrain your brain</h3>
<p>Here are two exercises to help people reframe agile development as a VBS instead of a WBS.</p>
<h3>Exercise 1: Understand what you are building</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you ask the team to articulate, at a high level, what it is building. Note that you&#8217;re not listing the steps to build it (that&#8217;s WBS) but instead are describing <em>what</em> it is (VBS).</p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>1. Create a list of what you are building</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s imagine the team says you&#8217;re building four things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new report on W</li>
<li>Modifying an existing report about X</li>
<li>A new screen with telemetry on Y</li>
<li>Bringing function Z, which exists in one organization, to three other organizations</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer could be a list such as the one above, or it could be a one-sentence answer such as &#8220;an autonomous vehicle.&#8221;</p>
<h4>2. Decide whether it&#8217;s an epic, feature, or story</h4>
<p>In a VBS, epics, features, and stories are the same thing: value delivery. It&#8217;s just that each has different rules and syntax due to each having a different level of risk.</p>
<p>Epics are highest risk, features are less risky, and stories the least risky. So epics require more rigor to ensure you have thought through the risks and have the best chance of success. </p>
<p>Additionally, every epic, feature, and story creates or modifies a product. That is the link to products in the &#8220;projects to products&#8221; journey.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is just a first estimate. So you need to decide based on the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Epics are value that will be delivered to production or be production ready in more than three months.</li>
<li>Features can be delivered in less than a quarter.</li>
<li>Stories can be delivered in less time than a sprint. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s shorthand for the same thoughts:</p>
<p>Keep that shorthand version handy for the next step.</p>
<h4>3. Match up the types with their value</h4>
<p>Looking at the list you created in Step 1, simply ask: How long would it take to deliver this value to production? &gt;1Q? &gt;1S? &lt;1S?</p>
<p>Then simply assign the correct type to the piece of value! Just like that, you now have epics, features, and stories in your backlog. Notice that you did not worry about this when you made your list of value.</p>
<p>Also, notice that your backlog has all three types in it, but so far there is <em>no</em> hierarchy. The work items are epics, features, and stories that started as those types without any upward traceability.</p>
<h3>Stumbling blocks in exercise 1</h3>
<p>This can make some people uncomfortable. Some feel that if a story or feature doesn&#8217;t trace to an epic, there is no container proving that the story or feature is valuable work. Some believe that all valuable work must be visible from the epic level, because the epic level (in SAFe) is also the portfolio level. And the portfolio level is where you make financial decisions about work.</p>
<p>But this is not actually correct. All three types—stories, features, and epics—are about value. The goal is to decentralize value decision making and push it downwards, where the risks are low. Stories and features are small, and the product owners and product managers are trusted and empowered to prioritize those types of work.</p>
<p>People can also feel as if these stories and features are &#8220;orphaned&#8221; if they don&#8217;t trace to a higher-level container. But, in fact, they <em>do </em>trace to a higher-level container: the product they are associated with.</p>
<p>Remember that all three types either modify or create products. In Azure DevOps, all of the stories, features, and epics use the &#8220;area path&#8221; field to designate what product they are affiliated with. And by doing that, you are linking all value delivery work to the products they create or modify.</p>
<p>In Jira, on the other hand, you can use &#8220;components&#8221; to represent the product that the work belongs to.</p>
<p>Whatever tool you use, don’t worry about tracing upwards. Just ensure that every epic, feature, and story traces to a product. And if you are using SAFe, how those products are funded and how those funds are used is decentralized by tying all epics, features, and stories to the funded products.</p>
<h4>Break down all features and epics</h4>
<p>At this point, you might have a pile of epics, features, and stories that need to be built. If all of the work is small, you may have only stories. If all the work is big, you may have a list of epics. Or you may have any combination, strictly based on the size of the work.</p>
<p>In the above example, perhaps W and Y were features due to size. X is small enough to do in one sprint, so it&#8217;s a story. And perhaps Z becomes three epics. There is no hierarchy here, just a pile of different size work to do.</p>
<p>While all items do not trace upwards, big items such as epics and features need to be decomposed so they can be prioritized with the other lower-level work that doesn&#8217;t trace upwards.</p>
<p>You can do this by asking, &#8220;What is a smaller piece of value we could do more quickly than this whole thing?&#8221; And as you decompose them, you do not decompose them into tasks but into value items.</p>
<p>And once you decompose features and epics into smaller value chunks, you once again ask, &#8220;How long would this take to put into production, or to make production-ready?&#8221; And again you give them the appropriate epic/feature/story type. Repeat this until every epic and feature has been decomposed to the story level.</p>
<p>Stories do not decompose into smaller value; you can decompose those into tasks. Note that tasks are the only element in the hierarchy that are like those found in a WBS. They are tasks, not value chunks.</p>
<p>In other words, the epics, features, and stories are all value chunks. The tasks are tasks, and they are optional.</p>
<p>Eventually every epic is decomposed into features. Every feature is decomposed into stories. And all of them are value chunks, not tasks. And thus you have a VBS instead of a WBS.</p>
<p>Some things in the original list of items were small enough to become features. Others were small enough to be stories. None of those trace up to a containing epic or feature if they started life smaller than that.</p>
<h4>The resulting story backlog</h4>
<p>So at the story level, you will have a bunch of stories, some of which are standalone, some that trace to features, and some that trace to features that in turn trace to epics. But all stories can now be prioritized against one another.</p>
<p>And if they do trace upward, that will be considered during sprint planning. You want to finish a whole feature if possible, so a high-priority feature would increase the priority of the stories as well.</p>
<p>Bottom line is that epic versus feature versus story is simply a first-level guess at the size of the effort to deliver value. It is almost like story point estimation, but at a much larger, easier level.</p>
<h2>Exercise 2: Fix an existing backlog</h2>
<p>For teams with an existing backlog that&#8217;s more WBS than VBS, this can be quite easy to repair. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1. </strong>Grab the current list of epics, features, and stories and leave it open in the background.</li>
<li><strong>2. </strong>Notice there is a hybrid of some items that are WBS tasks, and some that are products or value of the VBS type. It is common to have a mix of both styles.</li>
<li>3. Extract the products or value, and create a fresh backlog with only value delivery items. </li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish step 3, take a task-style backlog item and ask, &#8220;What product or sub-product does this create or improve?&#8221; The answer will be the real VBS item that should be in your backlog instead. If you can&#8217;t figure out the answer, then why would you do that task?</p>
<p>The third step can be fun and satisfying for your teams. Their new epics, features, and stories are true value work items. Each work item needs refinement, development, test, and deployment. Each is valuable to users.</p>
<p>Imagine that your story board columns were &#8220;refine, develop, test, deploy, done.&#8221; Notice that a WBS task-style story doesn’t work on a board such as this: &#8220;test component X&#8221; would make sense only in the test column, rather than flowing through them all.</p>
<p>Value-type VBS stories, on the other hand, flow through all of this. &#8220;New finance report V,” for example: Refine your understanding of it. Develop it. Test it. Deploy it. Done! Value to the user is achieved. But when &#8220;test component X&#8221; moves to done, direct user value has not been achieved.</p>
<h2>Measuring value delivery</h2>
<p>Once you move away from a WBS to a real VBS, you can easily report on value delivery. Which epics closed? That is value delivery. Which features closed? Value delivery. Stories? Value delivery.</p>
<p>So your value delivery reports can simply be reporting on work items closed. And it only works if the work items are real value delivery items, not work breakdown tasks.</p>
<p>Other Kanban state changes can be educational as well. Which epics moved into MVP delivered, testing the hypothesis now? Which features were pulled from the backlog into implementing? And so on. If every item is a value delivery item, these reports are satisfying and informative.</p>
<p>If someone wants a report of value delivery for their dollars, they can now show their recently done backlog and answer that question by just using their work management tools instead of creating PowerPoint slides. It is a beautiful thing!</p>
<h2>Make the switch</h2>
<p>Many people see their agile work management tools as a hierarchy of epic, feature, and story. And the muscle memory of a WBS is so strong, they overlay their WBS into the containers of epic, feature, and story.</p>
<p>Instead, focus on products, sub-products, and value delivery. Refactor existing backlogs by separating tasks from value. Think of the epic-feature-story hierarchy as nothing more than a first estimate on time. Epics take more than a quarter. Features require more time than a sprint. Stories are done within a sprint. And all are value delivery items in a VBS.</p>

<div>
<p>In June <a target="_blank" href="https://www.applitools.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools</a> invited any and all to its “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.applitools.com/hackathon/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultrafast Grid Hackathon</a>”. Participants tried out the <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/ultrafast-grid/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools Ultrafast Grid</a> for cross-browser testing on a number of hands-on real-world testing tasks.</p>
<p>As a software tester of more than 6 years, the majority of my time was spent on Web projects. On these projects, cross-browser compatibility is always a requirement. Since we cannot control how our customers access websites, we have to do our best to validate their potential experience.  We need to validate functionality, layout, and design across operating systems, browser engines, devices, and screen sizes.</p>
<p>Applitools offers an easy, fast and intelligent approach to cross browser testing that requires no extra infrastructure for running client tests.</p>
<h2 id="h.c7tp85m7u1uv">Getting Started</h2>
<p>We needed to demonstrate proficiency with two different approaches to the task:</p>
<ul>
<li>What Applitools referred to as modern tests (using their Ultrafast Grid) </li>
<li>Traditional tests, where we would set up a test framework from scratch, using our preferred tools. </li>
</ul>
<p>In total there were 3 tasks that needed to be automated, on different breakpoints, in all major desktop browsers, and on Mobile Safari:</p>
<ul>
<li>validating a product listing page’s responsiveness and layout,</li>
<li>using the product listing page’s filters and validating that their functionality is correct</li>
<li>validating the responsiveness and layout of a product details page</li>
</ul>
<p>These tasks would be executed against a V1 of the website (considered “bug-free”) and would then be used as a regression pack against a V2 / rewrite of the website.</p>
<h2 id="h.m5inrnesihyf">Setting up Cypress for the Ultrafast Grid</h2>
<p>I chose <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cypress.io/" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cypress</a> as I wanted a tool where I could quickly iterate, get human-readable errors and feel <em>comfortable</em>. The required desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox and Edge Chromium) are all compatible. The system under test was on a single domain, which meant I would not be disadvantaged choosing Cypress. None of Cypress’ more advanced features were needed (e.g. stubbing or intercepting network responses).</p>
<p>The modern cross browser tests were extremely easy to set up. The only steps required were two npm package installs (Cypress and the Applitools SDK) and running</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">npx eyes-setup</pre>
<p>to import the SDK. </p>
<p>Easy cross browser testing means easy to maintain as well.  Configuring the needed browsers, layouts and concurrency happened inside `applitools.config.js`, a mighty elegant approach to the many, many lines of capabilities that plague Selenium-based tools.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>
<p>In total, I added three <em>short</em> spec files (between 23 and 34 lines, including all typical boilerplate). We were instructed to execute these tasks against the V1 website then mark the runs as our baselines. We would then perform the needed refactors to execute the tasks against the V2 website and mark all the bugs in Applitools.</p>
<p>Applitools’ <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/features/#visual-ai" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Visual AI</a> did its job so well, all I had to do was mark the areas it detected and do a write-up!</p>
<p>In summary, for the modern tests: </p>
<ul>
<li>two npm dependencies, </li>
<li>a one-line initialisation of the Applitools SDK, </li>
<li>6 CSS selectors, </li>
<li>109 total lines of code, </li>
<li>a 3 character difference to “refactor” the tests to run against a second website, </li>
</ul>
<p>all done in under an hour.  </p>
<p>Performing a visual regression for all seven different configurations added no more than 20 seconds to the execution time. It all worked as advertised, on the first try. That is the proof of easy cross browser testing</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.17.05.png" alt="Screenshot 2020 07 23 at 17.17.05" class="wp-image-20474" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.17.05.png 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.17.05-300x32.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.17.05-1024x108.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.17.05-768x81.png 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.17.05-1536x162.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
<h2 id="h.qj3lwzbsaw3">Setting up the traditional cross-browser tests</h2>
<p>For the traditional tests I implemented features that most software testers are either used to or would implement themselves: a spec-file per layout, page objects, custom commands, (attempted) screenshot diff-ing, linting and custom logging.</p>
<p>This may sound like overkill compared to the above, but I aimed for feature parity and reached this end structure iteratively.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.18.41.png" alt="Screenshot 2020 07 23 at 17.18.41" class="wp-image-20475" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.18.41.png 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.18.41-300x175.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.18.41-1024x598.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.18.41-768x449.png 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.18.41-1536x898.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, neither one of the plug-ins I tried for screenshot diff-ing (`cypress-image-snapshot`, `cypress-visual-regression` and `cypress-plugin-snapshots`) gave results in any way similar to Applitools. I will not blame the plug-ins, though, as I had a limited amount of time to get everything working and most likely gave up way sooner than one should have.</p>
<p>Since screenshot diff-ing was off the table, I chose to check each individual element. In total, I ended up with 57 CSS selectors and to make future refactoring easier I implemented page objects. Additionally, I used a custom method to log test results to a text file, as this was a requirement for the hackathon.</p>
<p>I did not count all the lines of code in the traditional approach as the comparison would have been absurd, but I did keep track of the work needed to refactor for V2 — 12 lines of code, meaning multiple CSS selectors and assertions. This work does not need to be done if Applitools is used, “selector maintenance” just isn’t a thing!</p>

</div>
<p>Applitools will intelligently find every single visual difference between your pages, while traditionally you’d have to know what to look for, define it and define what the difference should be. Is the element missing? Is it of a different colour? A different font or font size? Does the button label differ? Is the distance between these two elements the same? All of this investigative work is done automatically.</p>
<h2 id="h.mpn7xjs1bsf3">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all, it has genuinely been an eye-opening experience, as the tasks were similar to what we’d need to do “in the real world” and the total work done exceeds the scope of usual PoCs. </p>
<p>My thanks to everyone at Applitools for offering this opportunity, with a special shout out to Stas M.! </p>
