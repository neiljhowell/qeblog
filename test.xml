<h3>Anti-patterns explained</h3>
<p>In software development, a pattern is simply a description of how to solve a problem. Sometimes that pattern is evident after the software has been created, and sometimes specific problems suggest the implementation of a specific pattern.</p>
<p>Patterns create a vocabulary for talking about software solutions in a way that most people can understand.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/best-practices-anti-patterns-containerized-deployments" rel="noopener noreferrer">An anti-pattern is a pattern</a> that you use to fix a short-term problem at the expense of your long-term goals. The insidious thing about anti-patterns isn&#8217;t that they don&#8217;t work or fail outright, but that they work in the short term while causing long-term failure and pain.</p>
<p>You got out of the frying pan for now, only to get into the fire later.</p>
<h3>Why anti-patterns are so sneaky</h3>
<p>People follow anti-patterns because they are useful in the short term. &#8220;In some cases, even the anti-patterns are better than not doing it at all. It is important to recognize this and not kid yourself into a false sense of security,&#8221; said my colleague <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrichardmills/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rich Mills</a>, DevOps solution architect at Coveros.</p>
<p>The problem arises when an anti-pattern becomes the new normal and the team stops there. The ability to recognize that you are using an anti-pattern and knowing how to get out of it is a key skill for continuously improving teams.</p>
<p>If you must embrace an anti-pattern, also embrace what you&#8217;ll need to do to move out of that anti-pattern as soon as you can. </p>

<h3>The hero anti-pattern</h3>
<p>Consider the classic hero anti-pattern, where one person or a small group goes to extraordinary lengths to deliver a project, usually by working a lot of extra hours to complete a project by the deadline.</p>
<p>To meet the timetable, however, the team may include substandard or dangerous code. In some parts of the industry, the hero pattern is not only in use but expected and celebrated. It has become a badge of honor to be a hero on a project. And, truth be told, there are <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/dont-be-devops-hero-youre-just-creating-devops-silo" rel="noopener noreferrer">times when teams need heroes</a>.</p>
<p>But there are long-term consequences of the hero anti-pattern. These include burnout and the development of negative relationships between team members. The latter often stem from the resentment of the &#8220;heroes&#8221; who supposedly saved the project from the people who didn&#8217;t go to the same lengths.</p>
<p>And when heroes burn out and leave the organization, they usually don&#8217;t leave behind the history of what they did because, when they were struggling to finish, many things, such as testing and documentation, got left out. This leads to lower-quality software with less stakeholder confidence in both the software and the team&#8217;s ability to deliver value.</p>
<p>In many cases, the hero anti-pattern is a reaction to management failure. The work wasn’t planned with the team’s capacity to deliver in mind. The team was asked to do more than it reasonably could given the schedule. There are many reasons why this happens, including regulatory demands, unmanaged stakeholder expectations, budget constraints, and unforeseen challenges.</p>
<h4>How to fix it</h4>
<p>One way to avoid dependence on heroes is to better manage the work scope, your deadlines, and expectations. This can be a tall order, but it is a way to finish your goals and not burn out your team.</p>
<p>Another way to not need heroes is to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/application-security-risk-report-2019-6-takeaways-your-app-sec-team" rel="noopener noreferrer">do risk analysis on the project</a><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/application-security-risk-tb/app-security-risk-takeaways?lx=qatC0j&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer"> </a>to determine what could derail the work. This will allow the team to incorporate risk mitigation into the work schedule. It can also get the team to estimate the work beyond best case scenarios.</p>
<p>You can also estimate using a range so that you don&#8217;t set the expectation that your estimates are certain and exact. Many agile teams use <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Fibonacci numbers</a> for assessments for just this reason; they want to model the uncertainty in their estimates.</p>
<h3>The continuous build anti-pattern</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/epic-devsecops-fails-6-ways-fail-right-way" rel="noopener noreferrer">DevOps isn&#8217;t immune to anti-patterns</a>, and continuous build (CB) is one such example. It&#8217;s what you get when you set up a continuous integration (CI) server without actually having a unit test suite or running code quality analysis on the codebase. You are building the software with each check-in. </p>
<p>(To clarify: CB is a subset of CI where you are only doing the first part of CI, and that is building. CI incorporates build, unit tests, and code quality static analysis.)</p>
<p>The CB anti-pattern is often <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-migrate-legacy-code-bases-continuous-delivery" rel="noopener noreferrer">used with legacy applications</a> or with a team as they transition to agile and DevOps. It often starts out with good intentions—you decide to put a CI server in place and start building tests. You don&#8217;t want to scare people with the large number of what you think are harmless issues by publishing code-quality metrics, so you tell yourself that you will put quality metrics in place after you&#8217;ve cleaned the code up.</p>
<p>But then feature requirements take the team&#8217;s attention away, and it never gets back to a place where it has enough unit tests to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/need-testing-metric-put-points-your-test-cases" rel="noopener noreferrer">start using quality metrics</a>, and it never finds time to clean up the codebase. The team is caught in a place where all it is doing is building the software with each check-in.</p>
<p>One thing you often hear when you talk to a team about this situation is, &#8220;It is so much better now than it was.&#8221; And this is often true; it is better to have a continuous build where you know if your software compiles and packages correctly than it was to build once a week, month, or longer and have to worry about making the software compile after an unknown number of changes.</p>
<p>Projects used to fail because huge parts of it were written in isolation and the differences couldn&#8217;t be resolved in a reasonable timeframe. But just because things are better now doesn&#8217;t mean they can&#8217;t be even better.</p>
<h4>How to fix it</h4>
<p>The goal of CI is to have confidence that you can merge the code written by different team members, compile it, and have it still work as the code author intended. You can&#8217;t do that without tests, and often unit tests are the right level of tests for that specific job.</p>
<p>The way to move continuous build into CI is to put that confidence back into the process by turning on unit testing and code quality analysis. Get your team, product owner, and stakeholders to agree to a change in your practices so that you will increase your unit test code coverage over time.</p>
<p>Get them to also agree to pay down your code quality <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/drowning-technical-debt-worse-youre-trapped-ponzi-scheme" rel="noopener noreferrer">technical debt</a> over time. These are issues that were created over time, and it will take time to resolve them, but only if you can agree on resolving them.</p>
<h3>Creating a DevOps silo anti-pattern</h3>
<p>Many organizations start their DevOps journey by adding a new DevOps silo that becomes the middleman between dev and ops. This becomes an anti-pattern when an organization stops moving dev and ops closer together into one team and just keeps the DevOps silo.</p>
<p><span class="disclaimer">Creating a separate DevOps silo used long-term is an antipattern.</span> </p>
<h4>How to fix this</h4>
<p>When a DevOps silo is created, the goal should be to work the dev and ops teams out of a job by bringing them closer together so that they collaborate as a conscious part of the work. The DevOps silo should have a defined time to &#8220;live&#8221; as part of the transformation charter. It should be something reasonable, say one to three years, and after that time the silo should no longer be needed. </p>
<p><span class="disclaimer">Within three years, your DevOps group should be structured like this.</span></p>
<p>In fact, the whole organization should be incented to help make the changes required to no longer need that silo, and the organization should have overlapping dev and ops groups where the DevOps work is done in the intersection.</p>
<h3>Selective automation</h3>
<p>This is what happens when office politics interferes with DevOps. It occurs when specific functions are excluded from automation because the people in charge of that function don&#8217;t, for whatever reason, want to have automation in their area. Being a bottleneck isn&#8217;t their problem.</p>
<h4>How to fix this</h4>
<p>To get the most value out of automation you need to have specific criteria used to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-automate-your-continuous-integration-collaborations" rel="noopener noreferrer">select what you automate</a>. These criteria could be based around what is most repetitive, the riskiest part of your process, where automation will create the highest ROI, or what takes the most time.</p>
<p>Once you set that criteria you should stick with it and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-get-started-rpa-5-projects-consider" rel="noopener noreferrer">automate processes </a>based on the priority generated from your selection criteria. Automating tasks that aren’t the highest priority can make your process <em>less</em> effective because it will create more backup in your critical path tasks as the automated, noncritical path tasks are completed faster.</p>
<h3>Recognize the warning signs</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve discussed four particularly pernicious anti-patterns here, but there are more to be aware of. As DevOps continues into the mainstream of software development, you can learn how to recognize and avoid anti-patterns. They may seem reasonable at first, but they&#8217;re bound to be damaging to your team—and your company—in the long run.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What is Disk Cleanup and does it remove viruses? It happens. You’re in the middle of a computing task, and]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>

<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs"></div>
<h3>What is Disk Cleanup and does it remove viruses?</h3>
<p>It happens. You’re in the middle of a computing task, and your screen blinks. The blue screen (Stop Error) is shown with the message that your PC ran into an error and needs to restart. These hiccups occur when your computer’s software, firmware, or drivers crash due to faulty or incompatible hardware or software.</p>
<p>If you’re like most people, you want a computer that’s nimble enough to keep up with your life. When your computer is bogged down with outdated files, you aren’t able to work at an efficient pace.</p>
<p>While a new computer or external drive may give you more file storage space, there’s a faster way to gain usable storage space without straining your budget. This option is called disk cleanup, and all Windows computers come with a version of it that you can use to reclaim hard disk space gratis. Here are some things that you need to know about Microsoft’s disk cleanup tool.</p>
<h3>What is Disk Cleanup?</h3>
<p>Disk cleanup is a maintenance utility that was developed by Microsoft for its Windows operating system. The utility scans your computer’s hard drive for files that you no longer need such as temporary files, cached webpages, and rejected items that end up in your system’s Recycle Bin. Unless you remove those files, they add up over time and begin taking a lot of space on your computer.</p>
<p>The utility displays the identified files and the amount of storage space that each of them uses within your hard drive. You decide which items to delete by the importance that you place on the files and the amount of hard drive space that you’ll be able to recover. In Windows 10, you can reach this utility by going to your start menu and scrolling to Windows Administrative Tools to click the disk cleanup button.</p>
<p>Windows also has the feature Quick Clean which lets you clean up the junk temporary files from your Windows desktop safely and quickly. It also cleans additional junk files, which the Disk Cleanup Utility does not.</p>
<h3>What are System updates?</h3>
<p>System updates such as major OS releases, monthly patches and emergency updates have become standard for today’s computers. Most operating systems are set to download the latest updates automatically. However, on Windows devices, the previous version of an operating system isn’t always deleted when the latest version replaces it. After years of updates, you’ll often have several versions of the OS on your computer.</p>
<p>The disk cleanup utility allows you to remove backup shadow copies from your computer. Programs that you download to open or edit a document take up storage space on your computer’s hard drive long after you’ve completed your project. Disk cleanup allows you to locate those programs, see how much storage space they use, and remove them to free up hard disk space. You’ll find these features by selecting the “more options” tab within the disk cleanup menu.</p>
<h3>What is Storage Sense?</h3>
<p>Microsoft Windows 10 comes with an upgraded disk cleanup function that’s called Storage Sense. With Storage Sense, you can set your system to automatically clean up unwanted files by setting the tab to the “on” position. You choose to allow Storage Sense to remove temporary files that your programs no longer use, files in the Download folder that haven’t changed in 30 days, and files that have been sitting in your Recycle Bin for over 30 days. You can reach Storage Sense by going to the Settings menu, clicking on the Systems button, and selecting the Storage option.</p>
<h3>What Are the Benefits of Disk Cleanup?</h3>
<p>While you can search for temporary files yourself and delete them manually, you save time by using the Windows disk cleanup tool. You can search your entire hard disk for specific files within a matter of seconds with the disk cleanup utility. The tool also gives you greater control over which files to delete and those to keep. When outdated application files are removed from your system, it runs more smoothly and has fewer crashes.</p>
<h3>Does Disk Cleanup Remove Viruses?</h3>
<p>One of the most common ways that viruses enter computer systems is through downloads. A user lands on an untrusted website and clicks on a button to get a free download. The download contains a virus that goes undetected. If the application remains untouched for longer than 30 days, you can run the disk cleanup utility to find the offending download and remove it quickly. While you shouldn’t use disk cleanup as a replacement for a robust antivirus product, the tool can work in conjunction with a trusted antivirus solution to better safeguard your computer’s system, files, and data.</p>
<h3>The Wrap Up</h3>
<p>Whether you use your computer to work from home or to manage your household, you’ll want it to function as it should. This includes the flexibility to download a program for a short-term project or quickly process spreadsheets to share with coworkers on an online portal. These operations are greatly impaired when your hard disk is full of unnecessary files and bloatware. Using the Windows disk cleanup tool allows you to remove these files that could contain malware and increase the capacity and safety of your computing environment.</p>

<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs"></div>
<h2>Signs Your Email Was Hacked</h2>
<p>With the advent of #Staysafe and #Shelterinplace, the increase of personal email com-munication has skyrocketed. This increase has allowed clever hackers to worm their way into installing viruses via attachments as well as other common techniques.</p>
<h2>You Know You’ve Been Hacked When…</h2>
<h3>Your Contacts are Receiving Messages Not Sent By You</h3>
<p>Messages that seem to come from you to friends or business contacts must alert you to a severe problem on your computer. Friends may have the confidence to let you know about these emails, but business contacts or professional associates may not. Hackers can install malware on their computers through email attachments, and the intruder can find a password with an amazingly small amount of effort.</p>
<h3>Your Online Password Stops Working</h3>
<p>As a regular visitor to your favorite sites, you know the password that each one requires. While you may accidentally strike a wrong key and create a typo, the chances of doing it twice seem highly unlikely. Since you know that the password appears not to work, you may need to consider the possibility that someone has hacked your email.</p>
<p>Once inside your computer, hackers have almost a free reign to look for your pass-words. Many people create a list of passwords for convenience, but the benefit to a hacker who finds such a file can reach significant proportions.</p>
<h3>Slow and Erratic Computer Performance</h3>
<p>Unpredictable conduct by your computer can mean that a virus may have infected it. The sluggishness that replaces the usual prompt response that you expect tells you that you have a problem. Spyware, a malicious type of software, can track your online activity, tamper with your files, and even steal your private information.</p>
<p>When you consider the burden that spyware can place on your system, you can under-stand the reason for its lackluster speed. While you probably did not notice anything wrong when you downloaded a picture from a website or clicked on an attachment in an email, a virus could have accompanied it. Until you remove the virus, you may feel as though you have someone watching you, and you do.</p>
<h3>Watching for Ransomware</h3>
<p>A particularly insidious form of malicious software comes with an ability to make you pay for the privilege of controlling your computer. Ransomware can enter your system through emails, and you allow it to do so when you click on an attractive attachment from an unknown sender. Ransomware can lock your files and make them inaccessible. The troublemakers who put it there demand a fee to release its grip on your system.</p>
<p>Maybe more dangerous than other malicious invasions of your computer, ransomware carries a penalty that can completely deny you access to your files and cost you money to get it back. As a caution that reminds you of the hazard of opening attachments that can cause damage to your computer and your finances, an email that installs ransom-ware deserves attention immediately.</p>
<h2>What Should I Do if My Email is Hacked?</h2>
<h3>Change your password</h3>
<p>This is the first thing you must do to ensure that the hacker can’t get back into your ac-count. Your new password must be complex and unrelated to previous passwords. Al-ways use 8-10 characters with a mix of upper and lower case characters as well as numbers and symbols.</p>
<h3>Reach out to your email contacts immediately</h3>
<p>A big part of the hacker’s strategy is to ‘get their claws’ into your address book to hook others as well. Send a message to all of your email contacts as soon as possible. Let them know they should avoid opening any emails (most likely loaded with malware) that have come from you.</p>
<h3>Change your security question</h3>
<p>If you have security questions associated with your email account, be sure to change them too. Make them unpredictable and niche.</p>
<h3>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication</h3>
<p>Yes, multi-factor authentication adds another step to your login, but it also adds another layer of protection. Enabling this will mean that in addition to your password, you will need a unique one-time use code to log in. This is usually sent to your mobile phone.</p>
<h3>Scan your computer for malware and viruses</h3>
<p>This is an essential step. Comprehensive security software will provide you with a digital shield for your online life. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee Total Protection</a> lets you protect all your devices – including your smartphone – from viruses and malware. It also contains a password manager to help you remember and generate unique passwords for all your accounts.</p>
<h3>Change any other accounts with the same password</h3>
<p>This is time-consuming but a worthwhile effort. Ensure that you change any other ac-counts that use the same username and password as your compromised email. Hackers love when we use the same logins for multiple accounts.</p>
<h2>Stay protected</h2>
<p>While email can pose potential security risks, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">antivirus software</a> protects your computer system from potential damage. Programs that run efficiently in the background detect and eliminate threats. Awareness and preparedness can help you thwart attempts to hack private information and let you maintain a secure environment online.</p>
