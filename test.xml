            </div>
<h2><strong>Ransomware Evolution to Most Promising Victim (MPV) Attacks</strong></h2>
<p>Ransomware cost businesses over $11.5 B with a 500% increase in attacks in 2019 according to Forrester Research. It’s your persistent threat.   Ransomware is a type of malicious software that infects a computer and restricts users’ access to it and their data until a ransom is paid to unlock it. It significantly challenges CIA (confidentiality, integrity and availability) all in one swoop. To understand the current ransomware, it’s best to review its evolution of attack structures.</p>
<p>Ransomware has been around for over 30 years, or three generations, ironically starting at a 1989 global health conference where an infected diskette was distributed to over 20,000 attendees.  As the internet evolved with access to more compute devices and online payment capabilities so did the attackers playing field.</p>
<p>Early variants of ransomware merely locked individual computers, sometimes even without encryption, thus preventing single user access. However, this has now evolved to locking entire organizations down. Criminals got clever with social engineering by masquerading the ransomware as a law enforcement agency (perhaps the FBI) and making accusations that illegal files are on the system.</p>
<p>With CryptoLocker in 2013, ransomware moved beyond scare tactics and became more aggressive and straightforward with demands of damaging systems by a certain timeframe. It seems 2014 is when ransomware took great strides forward. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/advanced-threat-research/?hilite=%27ctb%27" rel="noopener noreferrer">CTB –Locker</a>, partly due to their business model, created hundreds of thousands of infections through phishing, making it the most dangerous ransomware family of 2016.</p>
<p>But the ransomware that got the world’s attention was WannaCry.  Why?  It practically held the world hostage. It took only days to infect over a quarter million computers.  The ransomware worm targeted older versions of Windows. Once in a network on a device, it searched for more devices to exploit. Given this vast global reach, WannaCry received a massive amount of media attention. .   One could argue it was pivotal to bringing cybersecurity to the boardroom as noted by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/wannacry-cyber-security-boardroom/" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> , making cybersecurity a mainstream business concern.</p>
<p>The most recent evolution— a business model called Ransomware-as-a-Service(RaaS)— worked for CTB locker and was taken to  another level  by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/rapidly-evolving-ransomware-gandcrab-version-5-partners-with-crypter-service-for-obfuscation/?hilite=%27gandcrab%27" rel="noopener noreferrer">GandCrab</a>,  becoming the most prolific ransomware of 2018 and  Q1 2019.  This model lowers the bar and gives cyber criminals a platform to deliver ransomware thus commoditizing the business.</p>
<p>Ransomware’s transformation over the years has been built on technology advances i.e.. Internet, mobile, crypto currency, etc. and a range and combination of malware tactics. Given the historical legacy of malware tactics, cybersecurity solutions should leverage this knowledge to hunt and investigate these artifacts and indicators of compromise.</p>
<h2><strong>Today’s Ransomware</strong></h2>
<p>So where are we today? Ransomware market has advanced with highly targeted tactics moving away from casting a wide net in the hopes some will engage. Threat actors now tailor the attack to target organizations with money, essential IP or sensitive critical data on their IT systems and organizations that are heavily depended on business continuity—as the most-promising victim (MPV).  Adversaries infiltrate first to scout the ransomware opportunity, and appear to be using the infected organizations to do reconnaissance and decide to as select the most-promising-victims for further exploitation and ransomware. In addition, they employ effective data deletion attack structures to prevent recovery.  A new threat of “pay or your data goes public” has emerged as well</p>
<p>Could your organization be a target or MPV for sophisticated tailored ransomware? Watch <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8K8RWYY4mg" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a> on a recent example of MPV attack.</p>
<h2><strong>Get Ahead of the Savvy Ransomware </strong></h2>
<p>Ideally one does not want to be an MPV.  The best position to avoid becoming an MPV is to become proactive.  What if your cybersecurity could automatically prioritize these attacks based on industry, region and your security posture? What if you could get detailed information on how the attack works before you get hit? What if you had the ability to predict the likelihood of being an MPV? More importantly what if you were prescribed specific actions to take to counter these attacks before they hit.  Enter <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products/mvision-insights.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">MVISION Insights</a> intelligently driving your endpoint security!</p>

<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Enterprise software development is a complex undertaking, and only companies that can respond to market changes by quickly delivering high-quality software will dominate in the digital age.</p>
<p>There is no silver bullet to achieve the level of business agility you&#8217;ll need. It <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/about-digital-transformation?lx=EGspVB&#038;utm_source=techbeacon&#038;utm_medium=referral&#038;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">requires a transformation</a> from a traditional waterfall mindset and old ways of thinking to a lean-agile mindset, with its associated principles and practices.</p>
<p>Scaling frameworks and DevOps approaches can provide the guidance you need to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/transform-it-run-business?lx=EGspVB&#038;utm_source=techbeacon&#038;utm_medium=referral&#038;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">transform your IT organization</a>—and the rest of the business. The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), the most popular scaling approach, spells out the seven core competencies you need to succeed in the digital age: organizational agility, lean portfolio management, enterprise solution delivery, agile product delivery, team and technical agility, continuous learning culture, and lean agile leadership. Still, success is not guaranteed, since it requires a careful implementation that’s best achieved with the help of a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scaledagile.com/blog/what-is-an-spct-and-how-can-you-become-one" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SAFe Program Consultant</a>.</p>
<p>Leadership engagement, alignment, and systems thinking are my favorite success factors for a transformation. See my global SAFe Summit talk: <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/372961836" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SAFe Transformations: We know how to do it but why do some fail? &#8230; and how can we correct the mistakes?</a></p>
<p>Besides the common success factors mentioned above, the frameworks are continuously evolving. Practitioners are constantly feeding learnings and experiences from the field back into the frameworks.</p>
<p>That’s what I did in my recent article, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/accelerating-flow-with-devsecops-and-the-software-factory/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Accelerating Flow with DevSecOps and the Software Factory</a>,&#8221; which highlights the importance of shift-left approaches and how you can apply those to accelerate time-to-market, improve quality, and reduce costs. Large enterprises especially can benefit from <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/optimize-devops-tb/software-factory-devops?lx=vm26kZ&#038;utm_source=techbeacon&#038;utm_medium=referral&#038;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">establishing a Software Factory</a>, an integrated set of tooling, services, data, and processes that helps teams to plan, develop, operate, and manage software and solutions. (SAFe defines &#8220;solutions&#8221; as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/solution/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">products, services, or systems you deliver to your customers</a>.)</p>
<p>Here are two helpful models, along with advice on how you can combine them with a Software Factory approach to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/optimize-devops-tb/devops-scale-software-factory?lx=vm26kZ&#038;utm_source=techbeacon&#038;utm_medium=referral&#038;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">advance your DevOps implementations</a> and strengthen business agility.</p>
<h3>The DevOps Evolution Model</h3>
<p>As Peter Senge describes in his book <em>The Fifth Discipline</em>, teams and organizations need a shared mental model to generate a common understanding of a problem and to collaborate on finding a good solution. To that end, I created what I call the DevOps Evolution Model. That model was developed during my training classes as a way to explain how people can best progress in their DevOps journeys.</p>
<p>This model can help you understand how to decrease lead time and reduce the length of the feedback cycle by shifting undone work to the left. (Undone work is additional work required to release a solution after the team is &#8220;done&#8221; with features and stories. Typical examples of undone work are any kind of testing, security checks and audits, documentation, open-source legal assessments, and compliance checks.)</p>
<p>Shifting undone work left enables your team to provide faster feedback, which leads to more usable products and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/reduce-defects-software-tb/slash-costs-software-defects?lx=HhQqWV&#038;utm_source=techbeacon&#038;utm_medium=techbeacon&#038;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">faster defect fixes</a>. This in turn accelerates flow and increases quality. Reducing or eliminating undone work <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb/high-perf-continuous-delivery?lx=-DC2cJ&#038;custom_url=continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&#038;utm_medium=referral&#038;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">leads to more frequent releases </a>and improved responsiveness to requirements changes.</p>
<p><em>Figure 1: The DevOps Evolution Model covers the four major stages in a DevOps journey and shows visually how your organization can progress from a less mature model to a more mature one (click to enlarge). Source: Peter Vollmer</em></p>
<h3>The CI/CD pipeline model</h3>
<p>The continuous integration/continuous delivery model evolved out of SAFe DevOps trainings and follow-up workshops I conducted. It has similarities to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/continuous-delivery-pipeline/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SAFe DevOps Pipeline mapping</a>, which models the end-to-end pipeline on a process level. The CI/CD pipeline modeling drills down on the detailed CI/CD pipeline and the associated build and integration process. In my experience, a lot of flow issues in complex enterprise setups are a direct result of having an immature CI/CD pipeline.</p>
<p>To create the model, you bring all stakeholders together to draw your entire pipeline process (build, integration, deployment, etc.) as nodes and edges. Nodes represent the components, and edges describe the relationships between the components. While you might think that your teams already know their end-to-end pipeline and would find this whole effort useless, this has never been the case in my experience.</p>
<p>The CI/CD pipeline model lets you see the big picture. In large solutions, no single person understands the end-to-end CI/CD process. By bringing the right people together, you can see the suboptimal results of local optimization and focus on highly effective end-to-end improvements.</p>
<p>For example, teams often claim that they build and deploy several times a day when in fact they are building and deploying the same code or components over and over again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key question for CI/CD improvements is not the number of pipeline runs but how long it takes from the time the team writes the code to when it arrives in staging or production. This is the most important question you should ask for each contributing component.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because it reduces lead time, CI/CD modeling boosts quality. Defective components can have a domino effect on the integrated final product, since the development of components that depend on defective ones get delayed. Worse yet, if your team discovers defects late in the development process, committed schedules can’t be met, or you may need to create shortcuts or workarounds to stay on schedule. That decreases quality and increases technical debt.</p>
<p><em>Figure 2: Here is an example of CI/CD pipeline modeling for a large enterprise product with more than 100 million lines of code (click to enlarge). Each orange sticky tag represents a large component (node), while the blue arrows are the edges that describe the build, integration, and deployment steps. Pink stickies show the cycle times, lead times, and percentage complete and accurate (%C&#038;A). The green sticky is the final, deployed product on staging. Note that &#8220;LST&#8221; stands for &#8220;large solution train&#8221; and &#8220;ART&#8221; stands for &#8220;agile release train.&#8221; Source: Peter Vollmer</em></p>
<h3>The enterprise advantage of a Software Factory approach</h3>
<p>Large enterprises are often seen as dinosaurs that <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/optimize-devops-tb/5-mistakes-doom-devops?lx=vm26kZ&#038;utm_source=techbeacon&#038;utm_medium=referral&#038;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">don&#8217;t get DevOps</a>. They lose market share to newly emerging, small companies that have agile and DevOps in their DNA from the very beginning. But while it’s true that moving a large enterprise forward is challenging, with the help of SAFe, you can successfully transform. You’ll be able to create or change your development value streams with minimal effort because people will already share the same language and mindset, and they will be able to quickly adjust strategy in response to opportunities or threats.</p>
<p>A Software Factory complements this ability by enabling teams to faster adjust the development setup to changing business needs and shorten ramp-up and onboarding times. In addition, it helps to reduce the cognitive load of your teams, and enables efficiency gains, fostering the shift left and shortening lead times.</p>
<p>The complex tool chains typically required for building enterprise software often <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/forget-monoliths-vs-microservices-cognitive-load-what-matters" rel="noopener noreferrer">result in cognitive overload</a> for the teams that use them. Think about required pipeline improvements and maintenance activities such as keeping up with latest tool and technology evolutions, as well as upgrades to build servers, operating systems, plugins, test automation tools, and so on. Add to that cognitive load release deadline pressure and the need to keep up with product and domain expertise as well as new features and bug fixes, and it’s no wonder that many CI/CD pipelines are unstable and unreliable.</p>
<p>A “pipeline as a service” can solve these issues and boost productivity. Dedicated experts maintain and continuously improve services that multiple product teams can use, relieving development teams of that burden so that they can focus on their core responsibility of developing high quality products in short time frames.</p>
<p>To attain a faster response to change in your development organization you need to standardize your development tools. This allows for better integrations between the tools and makes it easier for your development teams to work on other products, since they will be familiar with all of the tools and core processes other product groups are using. A standardized set of tools sets the stage for modern software development approaches such as shared code ownership and internal open source.</p>
<p>Standardizing tools using a Software Factory approach can tremendously reduce licensing and maintenance costs, while also reducing the number of required integrations and synchronizations between tools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have a menagerie of tools, you probably have a lot of unreliable, half-functioning integrations and costly maintenance efforts. That means unnecessarily high total cost of ownership, busy people, and an unreliable flow of development data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But standardization requires a careful balance. My advice is to standardize as much as necessary while providing as much freedom as possible. Not all tools and processes are candidates for standardization. A Software Factory usually starts small and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/optimize-devops-tb/devops-scale-software-factory?lx=vm26kZ&#038;utm_source=techbeacon&#038;utm_medium=referral&#038;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">incrementally evolves</a> based on adoption and user feedback. Figure 3 shows a proven Software Factory architecture with the core elements.</p>

<h3>How to get started</h3>
<p>Mastering enterprise software and cyber-physical systems is a complex endeavor with no easy solution or silver bullet. The Scaled Agile Framework and some others can provide guidance and a strong foundation for your digital transformation journey.</p>
<p>Advanced DevOps models, in combination with a Software Factory approach, enhance and complement these offerings so that your organization can thrive in the digital age. If you’re just starting your journey, get going in the right direction by talking to a SAFe Program Consultant Trainer (SPCT) or attend a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scaledagile.com/certification/courses/leading-safe/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Leading SAFe class</a>.</p>

<h3> What is GPS spoofing?</h3>
<p>Global positioning system (GPS) technology is now the standard way for travelers to efficiently get from point A to point B. While GPS delivers unparalleled opportunities to businesses and individuals, there are some drawbacks to using this technology. GPS devices can be vulnerable to cyber attacks through GPS spoofing.</p>
<h3>GPS Spoofing 101</h3>
<p>Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have been around for years in many industrialized countries, and GPS is just one of those systems.   GPS spoofing happens when someone uses a radio transmitter to send a counterfeit GPS signal to a receiver antenna to counter a legitimate GPS satellite signal. Most navigation systems are designed to use the strongest GPS signal, and the fake signal overrides the weaker but legitimate satellite signal.</p>
<h3>Commercial Hazards of GPS Spoofing</h3>
<p>GPS spoofing isn’t to be confused with GPS jamming. GPS jamming happens when a cyber criminal blocks GPS signals altogether. Selling or using GPS jamming equipment that can block communications is illegal in the United States. While GPS jamming appears to be the greater threat, GPS spoofing delivers a sucker punch to a variety of businesses.</p>
<p>GPS spoofing allows hackers to interfere with navigation systems without operators realizing it. The fake GPS feeds cause drivers, ship captains, and other operators to go off course without any coercion. Businesses that are particularly vulnerable to GPS spoofing are shipping companies, taxi services, and construction companies.</p>
<h3>Shipping Companies</h3>
<p>Shipping companies that haul freight via land, air, and sea all use GPS-based navigation systems to get cargo safely to destinations all over the world. GPS spoofing leaves these shipments vulnerable to hijacking and theft. A practical example of this is where hijackers use GPS spoofing to misdirect a vehicle to a location where its cargo can be robbed—and hid the truck’s location while it’s happening. Additionally, many shippers use GPS-enabled locks to secure their cargo, allowing them to open only when the truck arrives at its set destination. GPS spoofing undoes those locks as well. In all, this puts drivers in danger, and trucking companies lose millions of dollars of cargo each year due to hijacking incidents such as these.</p>
<h3>Taxi and Ride Sharing Services</h3>
<p>Gone are the days when taxi drivers relied solely on their knowledge of a city’s streets to transport passengers. Today’s taxi drivers can go into any city that their license allows and do their jobs efficiently with the use of GPS technology. This flexibility comes with some drawbacks, however. GPS spoofing allows drivers to fake their location and commit criminal acts while still on the clock. Drivers from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/uber-data-breach-consumers-need-know/?hilite=%27uber%27" rel="noopener noreferrer">ride services</a> can also use the technique to fraudulently place themselves in surge areas to get more money for their services. Projecting a false location is a financial risk to companies and is potentially dangerous for passengers.</p>
<h3>Construction Companies</h3>
<p>While skilled construction workers are certainly valued, specialized tools, equipment, and machinery are the assets that many construction companies seek to track. These expensive assets commonly go missing on worksites, which eats into company profits. In recent years, GPS asset tracking systems have been installed to make sure construction equipment, tools, and machinery remain at authorized worksites. By using GPS spoofing, a thief could move an asset to a new location without anyone knowing about it until it was too late.</p>
<h3>Dangers of GPS Spoofing for Everyone Else</h3>
<p>GPS spoofing isn’t just a threat to businesses and government agencies; it also can be the catalyst for significant harm to individuals who rely on GPS. Cruising waterways along the coasts is a favorite hobby for those who enjoy boating.. Modern boats are equipped with GPS-based navigation systems. A cyber criminal can use GPS spoofing to get a skipper to steer his boat off course and into the path of danger from modern-day pirates.</p>
<p>The makers of location-based dating apps tout them as a safe way to meet a potential mate. These apps use GPS technology to help users identify dates by their location. When a bad actor uses GPS spoofing, he can fake his location or guide his date to a dangerous location.</p>
<p>The future of driving is now. Some electric cars are already equipped with an autopilot feature that offers unparalleled convenience to travel-weary drivers. However, independent research findings have uncovered a critical vulnerability in the cars’ navigation systems.  What will happen when fully autonomous, self-driving cars are made without steering devices that would allow a person to take control of their car during a GPS spoofing incident?</p>
<h3>Tips to Combat GPS Spoofing Attacks</h3>
<p>If you own a business that relies on GPS-based navigation systems, you’ll want to know the best ways to sabotage GPS spoofing attacks. The Department of Homeland Security points out some physical and procedural techniques to fight the problem. It recommends that companies hide GPS antennas from public view. GPS spoofing works well when an attacker can get close to an antenna and override legitimate GPS signals that come from orbiting satellites.</p>
<p>The agency suggests installing a decoy antenna that’s in plain view of would-be cyber criminals. Adding redundant antennas in different locations at your site allows you to notice if one antenna is being targeted for GPS spoofing. Companies such as Regulus Cyber are also developing GPS spoofing detection software that alerts users of spoofing incidents and keeps their devices from acting on spoofed GPS data.</p>
<p>Additionally, organizations should consider taking GPS-enabled equipment offline whenever connectivity isn’t actively required—thus making them less susceptible to attack. Likewise, following the basics of security hygiene provide further protection, such as regular updates and changing of passwords, along with the use of two-factor authentication, network firewalls, and other cyber defenses.</p>
<h3>GPS Spoofing for Privacy</h3>
<p>While GPS spoofing can cause big problems for people, businesses, and governments, there is a legitimate use for the practice. GPS tracking and location sharing present everyone with real privacy issues. GPS spoofing allows users to hide their actual location from those who could cause harm. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Security</a> companies can use GPS spoofing to guard high-profile clients or expensive merchandise. Individuals can install GPS spoofing apps for free on their Android phones to mask their locations and protect their privacy.</p>
