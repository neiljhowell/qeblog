<h2><strong>Ransomware and DDoS is on the Rise: Tips for Distance Learning in 2021</strong></h2>
<p>The holidays have come and gone, and students returned to the virtual classroom. But according to the FBI, cyberattacks are likely to <a target="_blank" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-warns-cyberattacks-distance-learning/story?id=75038470" rel="noopener noreferrer">disrupt online learning</a> in the new year. As of December 2020, the FBI, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and MS-ISAC continue to receive reports from K-12 educational institutions about the disruptions caused by cyberthreats, primarily ransomware and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). To protect their education and digital lives, distance learners will need to stay vigilant when it comes to ransomware and DDoS attacks. Let’s dive into the impact these threats have on the K-12 education system now that more people are plugged in as a result of distance learning.</p>
<h3><strong>Hackers Hold Education for Ransom</strong></h3>
<p>Of all the attacks plaguing K-12 schools this year, ransomware has been a particularly aggressive threat. Ransomware attacks typically block access to a computer system or files until the victim pays a certain amount of money or “ransom.” The FBI and the CISA issued a warning that showed a nearly 30% increase in ransomware attacks against schools. In August and September, 57% of ransomware incidents involved K-12 schools, compared to 28% of all reported ransomware incidents from January through July. And it’s unlikely that hackers will let up anytime soon. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/education/bs-md-baltimore-county-schools-ransomware-20200106-20210107-7auuijearndh5oblbndcws74wa-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baltimore County’s school system</a> was recently shut down by a ransomware attack that hit all of its network systems and closed schools for several days for about 111,000 students. It wasn’t until last week that school officials could finally regain access to files they feared were lost forever, including student transcripts, first-quarter grades, and vital records for children in special education programs.</p>
<p>According to to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/cisa-and-fbi-warn-of-rise-in-ransomware-attacks-targeting-k-12-schools/" rel="noopener">ZDNet</a>, the five most active ransomware groups targeting K-12 schools are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ryuk-ransomware-attack-rush-to-attribution-misses-the-point/?hilite=%27ransomware%27" rel="noopener">Ryuk</a>, Maze, Nefilim, AKO, and Sodinokibi/REvil. Furthermore, all five of these ransomware families are known to run “leak sites,” where they dump data from victims who don’t pay the ransom. This creates a particularly dangerous problem of having student data published online. To prevent distance learning disruption, students and educators need to understand the effects of ransomware on school systems and take steps to prevent the damage caused by this threat.</p>
<h3><strong>DDoS Attacks Disrupt the Distance Learning</strong></h3>
<p>An increase in ransomware attacks isn’t the only problem that K-12 schools are facing. The CISA and the FBI warned those participating in distance learning to protect themselves against other forms of cyberattacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). DDoS is a method where hackers flood a network with so much traffic that it cannot operate or communicate as it normally would.</p>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/preventing-and-mitigating-ddos-attacks-its-elementary/a/d-id/1339385" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Reading</a>, Miami-Dade County Public Schools experienced significant disruptions during their first three days of distance learning for the 2020-2021 school year, thanks to a series of DDoS attacks. The school system stated it had already experienced more than a dozen DDoS attacks since the start of the school year. Sandwich Public Schools in Massachusetts were also knocked offline by a DDoS attack. When school systems fall victim to DDoS attacks, students can lose access to essential documents, files, or online platforms that they need to complete assignments. And with many students relying heavily on distance learning systems, losing access could put them behind.</p>
<h3><strong>Delete Disruptions: Follow These Security Tips</strong></h3>
<p>In an effort to create a standardized framework for dealing with ransomware attacks across verticals – including education – McAfee has teamed up with Microsoft to lead the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-and-mcafee-headline-newly-formed-ransomware-task-force/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ransomware Task Force</a>, along with 17 other security firms, tech companies, and non-profits. And while we’re taking critical actions to decrease the threat of ransomware attacks, there are other steps you can take to prevent ransomware and DDoS attacks from interrupting your distance learning experience. Follow these tips to take charge of your education and live your digital life free from worry:</p>
<h3><strong>Don’t pay the ransom </strong></h3>
<p>Many ransom notes seem convincing, and many only request small, seemingly doable amounts of money. Nevertheless, you should never pay the ransom. Paying does not promise you’ll get your information back, and many victims often don’t. So, no matter how desperate you are for your files, hold off on paying up.</p>
<h3><strong>Do a complete backup </strong></h3>
<p>With ransomware attacks locking away crucial data, it’s important to back up your files on all your machines. If a device becomes infected with ransomware, there’s no promise you’ll get that data back. Ensure you cover all your bases and have your data stored on an external hard drive or in the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Use decryption tools </strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nomoreransom.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>No More Ransom </strong></a>– an initiative that teams up security firms, including McAfee, and law enforcement – provides tools to free your data, each tailored for a specific type of ransomware. If your device gets held for ransom, start by researching what type of ransomware it is. Then, check out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nomoreransom.org/decryption-tools.html" rel="noopener">No More Ransom’s decryption tools</a> and see if one is available for your specific strain.</p>
<h3><strong>Secure your router </strong></h3>
<p>Your Wi-Fi router is the gateway to your network. Secure it by changing the default password. If you aren’t sure how to do this, consult the internet for instructions on how to do it for your specific make and model, or call the manufacturer. Solutions like <a target="_blank" href="https://securehomeplatform.mcafee.com/" rel="noopener">McAfee Secure Home Platform</a>, which is embedded within select routers, can help you easily manage and protect your network from DDoS attacks and more.</p>
<h3><strong>Change default passwords on IoT devices</strong></h3>
<p>A lot of internet of things (IoT) devices come with default usernames and passwords. After taking your IoT device out of the box, the first thing you should do is change those default credentials. If you’re unsure of how to change the default setting on your IoT device, refer to setup instructions or do a bit of research online.</p>

            </div>
<p> </p>
<p>Picture an infant with a credit card.<br />In her name. With a $10,000 limit.</p>
<p>Well, it happens. As recent as 2017, it was estimated that more than<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/24/child-identity-theft-is-a-growing-and-expensive-problem.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 1 million children in the U.S. were victims of identity theft.</a> Of them, two-thirds were under the age of seven, and the total losses connected to all this fraud weighed in $2.6 <em>billion</em> dollars.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/the-connected-lives-of-babies-protecting-first-footprints-in-the-digital-world-part-1/" rel="noopener">part one</a> of our article on the connected lives of babies, babies can make their first digital footprints before they’re even born. What’s more, the moment a child enters this world along with a unique ID like a Social Security Number, they become a tempting target for cybercriminals. The reason is this: babies and very young children are effectively a blank slate, upon which crooks can write their own illicit history of fraud. And it can be years before you or your child find out, long after the damage to their credit has been done.</p>
<p>So, let’s pick up where we left off in part one by taking a close look baby’s privacy and how you can protect it.</p>
<h3>Protect baby’s identity</h3>
<p>There’s rightfully a great deal of conversation out there about the things <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/identity-protection/id-theft-faq/?hilite=%27identity%27%2C%27theft%27" rel="noopener noreferrer">we can do to protect our identity from theft</a>. What’s talked about less often is protecting children from identity theft. In fact, little ones are high-value targets for cybercriminals is because we typically don’t run credit reports on children. In this way, a crook with the Social Security Number of a child in the U.S. can open all manner of credit and accounts and go undetected for years until that child attempts to rent an apartment or open his or her first credit card.</p>
<p>To protect your family from this kind of identity theft, the major credit reporting agencies suggest the following:</p>
<p><strong>I. Check your child’s credit regularly.</strong> If your child indeed has a credit report against their name, there’s a strong chance that their identity has been stolen. You can work directly with the credit reporting agency to begin resolving the issue. If there is theft, file a report with the appropriate law enforcement agency. You’ll want a record of this as you dispute any false records.<br /><strong>II. Freeze your child’s credit.</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.equifax.com/personal/education/identity-theft/freezing-your-childs-credit-report-faq/" rel="noopener noreferrer">A freeze will prevent access to your child’s report</a> and thus prevent any illicit activity. In the U.S., you’ll need to create a separate freeze with each of the three major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion). It’s free to do so, yet you’ll have to do a little legwork to prove that you’re indeed the child’s parent or guardian.<br /><strong>III. Secure your documents and keep personal info close to the vest</strong>. Along with things like a passport, insurance cards, and birth certificates, store these items in a safe location when you’re not actively using them. That goes extra for Social Security cards. Likewise, doctor’s offices often ask patients for their Social Security Number, which typically helps with their billing. See if they can accept an alternative form of ID, use just the last four digits, or simply forgo it altogether.</p>
<h3>Register a URL for your child</h3>
<p>Getting your kiddo a website is probably low on your list of priorities, yet it’s a sound move to consider. Here’s why: it carves out a piece of digital real estate that’s theirs and theirs alone.</p>
<p>Whether you opt for a dot-com or one of several hundred other extensions like .net, .us, and .me, a personal URL gives you and your child ownership of yet another piece of their digital identity. No one else can own it as long as you’re paying the fee to maintain it. Think of it as an investment. Down the road, it could be used for a personal email address, a professional portfolio site someday, or just a side project in web design. With internet URLs being a finite resource, it’s wise to see if spending a relatively small fee each a year is worth securing this piece of your child’s identity.</p>
<h3>Sharenting: Think of baby’s future</h3>
<p>We all have one—that picture from our childhood that we absolutely dread because it’s embarrassing as all get-out. Now contrast that with today’s digital age, where an estimated <a target="_blank" href="https://99firms.com/blog/instagram-marketing-statistics/#gref" rel="noopener noreferrer">95 million photos are posted each day on Instagram alone</a>. We’re chronicling our lives, our friends’ lives, and the lives of our families at an incredible rate—almost without thinking about it. And that opens a host of issues about privacy and just how much we share. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/oversharing-are-you-ignoring-your-childs-privacy-when-you-post-online/?hilite=%27sharenting%27" rel="noopener">Enter the notion of “sharenting,” a form of oversharing that can trample your child’s right to privacy.</a></p>
<p>For babies, we have to remember that they’re little people who, one day, before you know it, will grow up. How will some of those photos that seemed cute in the moment hold up when baby gets older? Will those photos that you posted prove embarrassing some day? Could they be used to harm their reputation or damage their sense of privacy and trust in you?</p>
<p>With that, let’s remember a couple things when it comes to sharing photos of our children:</p>
<p>• The internet is forever. Work on this basic assumption: once you post it, it’s online for good.<br />• Babies have a right to privacy too. It’s your job to protect it while they can’t.</p>
<p>So, before you post, run through that one-two mental checklist.</p>
<h3>Sharenting: Identity Theft</h3>
<p>Sharenting can also lead to identity theft. In 2018, Barclay’s financial services estimated that oversharing by parents on social media will amount to more than 7 million cases of identity theft a year by 2030—just shy of a billion dollars U.S. worth of damage. This includes all the tips and cues that crooks can glean from social media posts and geographic metadata that’s captured in photographic files. Things like birthdays, pet names, names of schools, favorite teams, maiden names, and so forth are all fodder for password hacks and targeted phishing attacks. The advice here is to keep your digital lives close to the vest:<br />I. Set all social media accounts to private. Nothing posted on the internet is 100% private. Even when you post to “friends only,” your content can still get copied and re-shared.<br />II. This way, the general public can’t see what you’re posting. However, keep in mind that nothing you ever post online is 100% private. Someone who has access to your page could just as easily grab a screenshot of your post and then continue to share it that way.<br />III. Go into your phone’s settings and disable location information for photos. Specifics will depend on the brand of your phone, but you should have an option via the phone’s “location services” settings or within the camera app itself. Doing so will prevent the geographic location, time, date, and even device type from appearing in the metadata of your photos.<br />IV. Above all, think twice about posting in the first place. “Do I really need to share this?” is the right question to ask, particularly if it can damage your child’s privacy or be used by a scammer in some form, whether today or down the road.</p>
<h3>The first steps for keeping your family safe online</h3>
<p>Like new parents don’t have enough to think about already! However, thinking about these things now at the earliest stages will get you and your growing family off on a strong and secure start, one that you can build on for years to come—right up to the day when they ask for their first smartphone. But you have a while before that conversation crops up, so enjoy!</p>

<div>
<p>This past year, we’ve seen a lot of trends emerging among our customers and the market. Organizations are doubling down on testing as they heavily rely on their online experiences to either survive or thrive, and they are also taking time to streamline their operations. DevOps transformation is accelerating, and to support that we’re seeing more and more organizations adopting native JavaScript testing frameworks as they <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/blog/shift-left-continuous-testing-eliminating-risk-through-agile-testing-practices" rel="noopener">shift testing left.</a> </p>
<p>Let’s take a look at why organizations are choosing JavaScript testing frameworks and how Sauce Labs can help you in your test automation and DevOps journey. </p>
<h3>Why are Cypress, TestCafe and Playwright gaining popularity? </h3>
<p>Cypress, TestCafe and Playwright are all native JavaScript test frameworks that have been in development for the past few years. They are each gaining popularity among developers as their capabilities become more robust. The advantages of native frameworks is that they are written in JavaScript, which many developers prefer, and they run within a browser, rather than remotely executing tests like Selenium. </p>
<p>This makes them developer-friendly and can reduce flakiness through the tight browser integration, network mocking/stubbing, emulating network capabilities and resolutions, as well as delightful features such as built-in waits and test reruns. All of these frameworks are open source and each have their own pros and cons depending on your testing priorities. Sauce Labs <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/platform/sauce-testrunner-toolkit" rel="noopener">supports all three</a>, and works with customers as they make decisions on the future of testing at their organizations. </p>
<h3>Is Selenium still relevant?</h3>
<p>Selenium is the most adopted and most robust test automation framework used today. It is also the preferred test automation framework for QA testers who run comprehensive test automation strategies, so we think it’s here to stay. </p>
<p>Selenium is comprehensive, complies with the W3C WebDriver standard, and is supported by the open source community. That means it offers the best test coverage and testing capabilities and remains the framework of choice for QA teams. With Selenium, you have remote testing targets, which allows you to specify exact browsers or browser versions and device combinations on a<a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/resources/articles/selenium-grid" rel="noopener"> Selenium grid</a> for complete and reliable testing. </p>
<h3>Are there other JavaScript testing frameworks?</h3>
<p>Yes, there are a lot of other JavaScript testing frameworks being developed such as WebdriverIO, Nightwatch and Puppeteer. </p>
<p>Of particular interest is WebdriverIO, which also complies with W3C standards and has broad support from the open source community. It leverages some of the native browser APIs to solve many of the same problems that Cypress, TestCafe and Playwright address. If you want Sauce Labs to support a framework that you use, <a target="_blank" href="https://info.saucelabs.com/javascript-at-scale-on-sauce.html" rel="noopener">let us know</a>! </p>
<h3>How does Sauce Labs integrate with Cypress, TestCafe or Playwright testing?</h3>
<p>Sauce Labs is a solution that scales test automation. So whether you use Selenium or Cypress along with Sauce Labs, you can both execute tests at scale, and deliver test insights for fast debugging. </p>
<p>As developers adopt DevOps, test automation needs to be robust to run each time code is committed and to provide tools for debugging. Sauce Labs has preconfigured Docker images and VMs for each framework that can be leveraged to run tests in the cloud at scale through the <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/platform/sauce-testrunner-toolkit" rel="noopener">Sauce Testrunner Toolkit</a>. This lets a team test locally, or on CI at scale. And no matter how you test, test assets are sent to the Sauce Cloud for easy debugging with screenshots, videos and logs and historical insights. </p>
<p>The Sauce Testrunner Toolkit can be used in conjunction with Sauce API testing, sisual testing, performance testing and live testing solutions to provide a full DevOps test toolchain solution. </p>
<h3>Should you switch from Selenium to Cypress, TestCafe or Playwright?</h3>
<p>Switching test automation frameworks is a big undertaking and you need to make sure you understand the tradeoffs. Start with your testing needs. Which browsers do you need to test on? Who will write automated tests in your organization? Are you integrating with CI/CD? No matter which test automation framework you decide to use, Sauce Labs solutions will let you scale and increase productivity as you shift testing left. </p>
<p>We’ve just opened a beta for native JavaScript testing on the Sauce Labs Cloud. If you use any native JavaScript framework, <a target="_blank" href="https://info.saucelabs.com/javascript-at-scale-on-sauce.html" rel="noopener">check out the beta here</a>. </p>
