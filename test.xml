										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>Enterprise IT organizations are under growing pressure to evolve. Fast-changing business requirements and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-pandemic?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener">accelerating digital transformation initiatives</a> have exposed limitations in traditional approaches to IT operations and IT services management. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other approaches that can help automate key IT operations functions are gaining traction in IT Ops, and some of the silos that existed between <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cyber-resilience-tb/cyber-resilience-trends-secops?lx=dSbBFJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">operations and security teams have begun to converge</a>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i>TechBeacon</i>&#8216;s<i> </i>top 12 enterprise IT stories for 2020 highlight the challenges that IT teams face as they try to balance the need to innovate against requirements to keep the business up and running. The articles offer expert guidance on <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/ai-ops-transform-it-tb/aiops-enterprise-6-t?lx=my3YKV&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">how to navigate change and achieve desired outcomes in 2021</a>, and highlight trends and best practices for IT practitioners to follow.</span></span></p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/its-time-it-ops-security-tools-finally-converge" rel="noopener">It&#8217;s time for IT Ops and security tools to finally converge</a></h4>
<p>Large-scale cyber-security events can often require a combined response from the security team, the IT operations group, product support, engineering, and other stakeholders in the enterprise. Unfortunately, these teams typically operate in separate silos, and the tools that each brings to the remediation effort can have overlapping functionality.</p>
<p>In this report, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeromelabat/" rel="nofollow noopener">Jerome Labat</a>, chief technology officer at healthcare systems provider Cerner, explains the evolution of the two-parallel-tool-sets phenomenon at many companies and why it&#8217;s time for IT operations and security tools to converge.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/state-it-operations-10-trends-watch" rel="noopener">The state of IT operations: 10 trends to watch</a></h4>
<p>IT operations teams do a lot more than just keeping the lights on at their organizations. Increasingly, they are the enablers of digital transformation, and the decisions they make can have long-lasting impact across the enterprise. That&#8217;s why IT pros need to keep on top of the latest trends now more than ever. Freelance writer <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jpmello" rel="nofollow noopener">John P. Mello, Jr.</a> talked with more than half a dozen IT pros to compile this list of the top 10 trends to watch in the IT Ops space over the coming year.</p>
<h3>Digital transformation</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/innovate-deliver-how-do-both-during-your-digital-transformation" rel="noopener">Innovate and deliver: How to do both during your digital transformation</a> </h4>
<p>The challenge with digital transformation initiatives is that IT organizations are expected to keep the business up and running even as they are called upon to innovate and transform. Doing both can be tricky, but as Cerner chief technology officer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeromelabat/" rel="nofollow noopener">Jerome Labat</a> explains, it can be accomplished by adopting the right strategy. Here, Labat explains the strategy that Micro Focus, <em>TechBeacon</em>&#8216;s corporate parent, adopted in its own IT digital transformation efforts when he was Micro Focus&#8217; CTO. And he highlights three key lessons that he says other organizations can apply to their own efforts.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-create-successful-digital-transformation-road-map" rel="noopener">How to create a successful digital transformation road map</a></h4>
<p>Digital transformation is more than just about technology, says <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bsairam/?originalSubdomain=in" rel="nofollow noopener">Sairam Bollapragada</a>, director of the global delivery center at Micro Focus professional services. Here he explains why the array of products, platforms, and devices that vendors sell are merely tools toward an end and not ends in themselves. Organizations that want to succeed at digital transformation need to have a clear road map and know how to leverage technology in an outcome-focused way to get there, he says.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-software-enabled-services-are-new-disruptor" rel="noopener">Why software-enabled services are the new disruptor</a></h4>
<p>Software-enabled services (SES) can help IT teams keep pace with digital transformation and are expected to be a major disruptor for both SaaS providers and on-premises software development models. SES take a factory approach to building software and delivers greater speed and agility benefits for the business world. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keithjahn/" rel="nofollow noopener">Keith Jahn</a>, vice president of digital factory at healthcare tech provider Cerner, says SES can help developers achieve desired outcomes quicker. He shows how organizations that have not yet begun their SES journey can get there.</p>
<h3>Robotic process automation</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-train-your-bots-5-rpa-fails-avoid" rel="noopener">How to train your bots: 5 RPA fails to avoid</a></h4>
<p>A broad perception exists that robotic process automation is hard to implement and prone to failures. Despite the enormous promise and inevitability of intelligent automation, a lot of organizations that have tried their hand at it have described it as not seeming to work. That perception is neither fair nor accurate, says Leading Edge Forum (and ex-Gartner) analyst <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/CSurdak" rel="nofollow noopener">Christopher Surdak</a>. Here he explains why most RPA failures are less serious than they appear and lists five of the most common mistakes to avoid if you want to succeed with RPA and AI.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/robotic-process-automation-5-key-trends-watch" rel="noopener">Robotic process automation: 5 key trends to watch</a></h4>
<p>There&#8217;s a high level of interest in robotic process automation (RPA) in enterprises. Industry analysts, in fact, expect that the market for RPA tools will outpace the rest of the technology industry over the next 12 months. However, some organizations that have already implemented RPA are running into problems, and many are reevaluating the tools and processes they are looking to automate. Freelance writer <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ErickaChick" rel="nofollow noopener">Ericka Chickowski</a> spoke to industry experts to compile this list of five trends to watch in the RPA space.</p>
<h3>AI Ops</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/4-reasons-why-aiops-future-it-operations" rel="noopener">4 reasons why AIOps is the future of IT operations</a></h4>
<p>Hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructure can be complex to manage, especially when digital transformation initiatives outpace the IT organization&#8217;s performance management capabilities. AIOps platforms, which Gartner describes as software systems that combine big data with AI and machine-learning functions, can help make IT operations more efficient. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/n-karthik-75138ab" rel="nofollow noopener">N. Karthik</a>, Micro Focus&#8217; country manager for enterprise sales, offers four reasons why AI and ML are the future of IT Ops.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/top-10-predictions-ai-it-operations" rel="noopener">Top 10 predictions for AI in IT operations</a></h4>
<p>The use of AI in IT operations has been gradually increasing in the years since analyst firm Gartner first coined the term AIOps. These days IT Ops tools that incorporate AI have become quite common, as has AI-enhanced automation. Even so, IT leaders remain wary about using AI functions for a variety of reasons. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiayigu/" rel="nofollow noopener">Jiayi Hoffman</a>, data science architect at OpsRamp, and expert at machine learning, lists 10 predictions for AIOps that she says IT operations specialists should track.</p>
<h3>Enterprise service management</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-esm-fails-7-sure-fire-ways-kill-your-project" rel="noopener">Why ESM fails: 7 sure-fire ways to kill your project</a></h4>
<p>Many organizations around the world have implemented enterprise service management (ESM) initiatives to streamline and optimize the customer services that multiple teams jointly provide within an organization. When done correctly, ESM projects can help improve customer satisfaction, improve productivity, and cut costs. But they work only when IT organizations can identify the true needs of their customers and are willing to work across siloed functions. <em>TechBeacon</em> contributing editor <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ssalgy" rel="nofollow noopener">Susan Salgy</a> identifies seven key issues that can threaten the success of ESM projects.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-esm-must-evolve-automate-end-end-value-streams" rel="noopener">Why ESM must evolve to automate end-to-end value streams</a></h4>
<p>Enterprise service management requires a lot more than just adapting and applying IT service management (ITSM) concepts to other areas of the business. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/dougtedder" rel="nofollow noopener">Doug Tedder</a>, principal at Tedder Consulting LLC and a veteran of numerous IT transformation projects, explains why organizations need to evolve their approaches to ESM projects if they want to achieve desired outcomes.</p>
<h3>Careers</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/best-places-work-tech-5-lessons-dev-ops-security" rel="noopener">Best places to work in tech: 5 lessons for dev, ops, and security</a></h4>
<p>Salaries for application developers, security analysts, network administrators, and other IT specialists tend to be considerably higher in major metropolitan areas such as San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles than in other parts of the country. However, when salaries are adjusted against cost-of-living expenses, the areas delivering the highest salaries for these professions are smaller and mid-sized cities such as Bloomington, Indiana; Bay City, Michigan; and Rome, Georgia. Freelance writer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roblemos/" rel="nofollow noopener">Rob Lemos</a> highlights the key takeaways of a <em>TechBeacon</em> analysis of salaries for four occupations and explains why smaller metropolitan areas are becoming the new tech hubs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<h3>All-remote workforce </h3>
<p>Like most other companies (essential workers notwithstanding), we were forced to shift to an all-remote workforce, meaning many Saucers found themselves working from home for the first time. This presented challenges, of course—some of us simultaneously became homeschool teachers, we lost the ability to have quick hallway conversations, and we just plain missed seeing our coworkers—but in the end, we rallied together and embraced the new normal (or should we say the Zoom normal?). </p>
<h3>Virtual user conference </h3>
<p>As the events of 2020 unfolded, we had to transform our popular SauceCon user conference into a virtual event: SauceCon Online. Although we missed seeing the testing community in person, we were able to host the event in two different time zones, which meant we could include people who might not otherwise be able to join us on-site. In fact, we were thrilled to have more than 5,000 registrants from 98 countries across two days! And thanks to a knowledgeable group of speakers and sponsors, the agenda was packed full of testing goodness, helping everyone in attendance to “Test Better, Together.” We also turned our Test Automation Days into virtual events, and were able to host different sessions by customer and by industry. Look for a virtual Test Automation Day near you soon! </p>
<p>We’re also reprising <a target="_blank" href="https://saucecon.com/" rel="noopener">SauceCon Online</a> April 20-22, so save the date and submit a <a target="_blank" href="https://saucecon.com/cfp-2021/" rel="noopener">speaking proposal</a> if you’d like to contribute.</p>
<h3>Open Source Program Office</h3>
<p>Open source is part of our DNA here at Sauce. In 2020, we created our <a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.saucelabs.com/" rel="noopener">Open Source Program Office</a> to deepen our investment in the broader open source community. This was a key part of our strategy to truly leverage sustainable and active support for open source software (OSS) within the company, and adding this was a huge highlight of 2020. </p>
<h3>Three billion tests … and counting </h3>
<p>In March 2020, we celebrated the three billionth test on the Sauce Labs platform. Yep, you read that right: three billion! We’ve learned a lot after that many tests, and we’ve gained expertise across many facets of testing. In 2020, we launched our second annual <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/resources/white-papers/sauce-labs-continuous-testing-benchmark-report-2020" rel="noopener">Continuous Testing Benchmark Report</a>, documenting observations based on those three billion tests. This report shows key performance benchmarks necessary to deliver automated testing at enterprise scale as well as how real-world organizations performed against those benchmarks. Now, our Data Science team is applying Machine Learning (ML) and pattern recognition against this rich store of data to provide our users with the guidance they need to improve their automated testing success. </p>
<h3>Elemental Selenium and Sauce School</h3>
<p>In 2020, we acquired Dave Haeffner&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://elementalselenium.com/" rel="noopener">Elemental Selenium</a> content library and site properties—and turned them into a great new training resource we’re calling <a target="_blank" href="https://training.saucelabs.com/" rel="noopener">Sauce School</a>. Testers have long used Elemental Selenium to learn how to automate their tests. This content is not only relevant to folks just getting started with Selenium, but also for experienced automation engineers who want to brush up on best practices and advanced concepts like parallel testing.  Dave’s Selenium guidance combined with the Sauce Labs platform offers a powerful combination of comprehensive testing coverage and proven real-world advice—an unbeatable formula that will help testing newbies and veterans alike. </p>
<p>Based on the Elemental Selenium guidance, our new Sauce School offering offers how-to tutorials and testing best practices for beginners and experienced automation engineers alike on topics such as Selenium, JavaScript and Java, with instructions for tools and test runners such as Mocha, JUnit, Jenkins, npm, Maven, Python, Pytest, and all things Sauce Labs.</p>
<h3>SOC2 compliance</h3>
<p>In December, we achieved <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/news/sauce-labs-completes-soc-2-type-2-certification-for-organization-wide-security-controls" rel="noopener">Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 Type 2 certification</a>, confirming that select company security processes, procedures, and controls have been formally evaluated and tested by an independent accounting and auditing firm and met the rigorous SOC 2 security standards. We’ve always been committed to security, and this is just further proof of that commitment. </p>
<h3>API testing </h3>
<p>We recently <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/news/sauce-labs-acquires-api-fortress-to-bolster-continuous-testing-platform-with-modern-api-testing-solution#:~:text=SAN%20FRANCISCO%20%E2%80%93%20December%2010%2C%202020,for%20agile%20and%20DevOps%20teams." rel="noopener">acquired API Fortress</a>, a leading provider of modern API testing solutions for agile and DevOps teams. This is a huge milestone for us and we were happy to welcome the API Fortress team to the Sauce Labs lineup. Adding API Fortress to our product offering means we will be able to offer customers a richer and more complete continuous testing experience that includes API testing, visual end-to-end testing, and front-end performance testing to go along with the functional UI testing that Sauce Labs is already known for.</p>
<p>We hope that 2021 is filled with even more firsts, and that we’ll be able to enjoy them in person.  In the meantime, we wish you good health and as always… happy testing! </p>

<div>
<p><span><span>Application development and testing practices are in a state of flux, as a growing number of organizations embrace agile, DevOps, and other modern methodologies.</span></span></p>
<p><em>TechBeacon</em>&#8216;s top app dev and testing stories for 2020 cover some of the most prevalent trends in the space. These 12 stories offer experts&#8217; guidance about some of the best automation and testing tools currently available, best practices to adopt, and what development teams can learn from companies that are killing it with agile.</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/11-top-open-source-api-testing-tools-what-your-team-needs-know" rel="noopener">11 top open-source API testing tools: What your team needs to know</a></h4>
<p>APIs have become the basis of modern application development, especially for organizations making the shift away from older, monolithic applications to microservices architectures. For such entities, API security has become a key consideration, says <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/joecolantonio" rel="nofollow noopener">Joe Colantonio</a>, founder of TestGuild. In this report, Colantonio describes why organizations need to pay attention to API security and lists 11 of the top open-source tools for testing application programming interfaces.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/web-performance-testing-18-free-open-source-tools-consider" rel="noopener">Web performance testing: 18 free open-source tools to consider</a></h4>
<p><span><span>Bad things can happen when organizations fail to conduct—or improperly conduct—performance tests on critical web applications. Stock-trading firm Robinhood learned that lesson the hard way when the company&#8217;s app crashed under heavy load during one of the stock market&#8217;s most significant swings. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/joecolantonio" rel="nofollow noopener">Joe Colantonio</a>, founder of TestGuild, provides an overview of key performance metrics for web applications and explains the importance of web performance testing. He lists 18 open-source tools that organizations can use in place of—or to complement—commercial testing tools.</span></span></p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/ai-testing-13-essential-resources-qa-pros" rel="noopener">AI in testing: 13 essential resources for QA pros</a></h4>
<p>AI promises to change software-testing processes drastically in the future. But the industry is not quite there yet, says <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpaulmerrill/" rel="nofollow noopener">Paul Merrill</a>, CEO and test automation consultant at software delivery consultancy Beaufort Fairmont. In this report, he explains why AI can still assist in testing efforts so long as the right tools are chosen. Merrill provides a quick overview of AI and its role in testing and lists 13 resources that he says every QA pro needs to share with the decision makers in their organizations.</p>
<h3>Automation</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/10-portfolio-projects-aspiring-automation-engineers" rel="noopener">10 portfolio projects for aspiring automation engineers</a></h4>
<p>Lack of demonstrable experience can be a big problem for people trying to get into the test automation field. Many hone their skills through self-study and practice but then have a hard time demonstrating their newly acquired skills to employers. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/techgirl1908" rel="nofollow noopener">Angie Jones</a>, senior developer advocate at testing-tool provider Applitools, explains why automation engineers should consider creating portfolios to highlight their skills just as developers do. In this report she lists 10 projects that will make an automation engineer&#8217;s portfolio stand out among the competition.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/test-automation-qa-career-guide-top-roles-skills" rel="noopener">Test automation and QA career guide: Top roles and skills</a></h4>
<p>Maturing DevOps practices are driving enormous change in the test automation and quality assurance (QA) field. QA engineers need to remain on top of these changes to stay on a solid career track, says freelance writer <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/erickachick" rel="nofollow noopener">Ericka Chickowski</a>. She spoke with hiring managers, recruiters, and practitioners in QA and test automation to compile this list of the three hottest skills and five most essential roles in the field.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/test-automation-tools-top-trends-challenges-2020" rel="noopener">Automation test automation tools: Top trends and challenges for 2020</a></h4>
<p>As with most things IT-related, the market for test automation tools has kept evolving and changing steadily over the years. A growing number of tools have begun incorporating AI and robotic process automation capabilities. The market has begun showing signs of fragmentation and big platform vendors are expanding their footprint in the space. Freelance writer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/linda-rosencrance-a8508876/" rel="nofollow noopener">Linda Rosencrance</a> sums up the state of the test automation tool market and lists the top trends to watch out for in the space.</p>
<h3>Agile</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/confused-about-safe-epics-follow-real-world-example" rel="noopener">Confused about SAFe epics? Follow this real-world example</a></h4>
<p>Epics—or containers for significant services, systems, or products—can be confusing for organizations moving to a Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) and the SAFe Portfolio Kanban. In this comprehensive report, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonyrc/" rel="nofollow noopener">Anthony Crain</a>, delivery manager for agile transformation at agile-services provider Cprime, uses a real-world example to explain SAFe epics in a way that brings greater clarity to the topic.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/8-ways-know-when-youve-done-agile-well" rel="noopener">8 ways to know when you&#8217;ve done agile well</a></h4>
<p>Numerous measures are available to help agile teams know if they are succeeding or not. Ironically, the most important among them are the ones that most teams don&#8217;t hear about much because they are indicators of success more than they are direct metrics. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/bobgalen" rel="nofollow noopener">Bob Galen</a>, agile practitioner, coach, trainer, and author at his consultancy in Cary, North Carolina, lists eight of the top measures that IT leaders should use to tell if their agile transformation efforts are really working or not.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/10-companies-killing-it-scaling-agile" rel="noopener">10 companies killing it at scaling agile</a></h4>
<p>The rigid structure within development organizations can often be at odds with agile and its requirements for experimentation, flexibility, and the ability to pivot quickly as things change. Scaling agile to meet the requirements of large organizations can be even trickier and challenging. However, this doesn&#8217;t mean companies aren&#8217;t succeeding at it. Freelance writer <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=christophernull" rel="nofollow noopener">Christopher Null</a> identifies 10 organizations that are setting an example for others through their work with agile.</p>
<h3>Dev</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/five-best-web-application-frameworks-how-choose" rel="noopener">The 5 best web application frameworks: How to choose</a></h4>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/matthewadavid" rel="nofollow noopener">Matthew David</a>, digital leader at Accenture, takes the guesswork out of selecting web application frameworks in this handy list of the top five. David, whose previous experience includes a stint as global leader at the Kimberly-Clark Mobile Center of Excellence, explains what exactly organizations should be looking for when evaluating a web application framework. David&#8217;s compilation of the five frameworks listed in this report is based on his own experience, and he lists the pros and the cons of each of them.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/better-behavior-driven-development-4-rules-writing-good-gherkin" rel="noopener">Better behavior-driven development: 4 rules for writing good Gherkin</a></h4>
<p>Behavior-driven development (BDD) practices can help create better software because they emphasize the use of plain-language examples to specify a product&#8217;s behaviors. Few languages exemplify the BDD movement better than Gherkin, says <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-leland-knight/" rel="nofollow noopener">Andy Knight</a>, lead software engineer in test at commercial-banking software provider PrecisionLender. He&#8217;s also the designer of multiple robust test automation systems for operating systems, services, APIs, and web apps. Here he explains why Gherkin is trickier to handle than most might initially assume and walks readers through four rules for writing good Gherkin.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/why-enterprises-are-adapting-their-cobol-apps-vs-ditching-them" rel="noopener">Why enterprises are adapting their COBOL apps vs. ditching them</a></h4>
<p>Enterprise use of COBOL apps received some scrutiny this year after some US states that are using the venerable programming language ran into problems distributing unemployment checks in the middle of the global pandemic. But as freelance writer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannaambrosio/" rel="nofollow noopener">Johanna Ambrosio</a> discovered in reporting this story, many organizations using COBOL apps have no plans to ditch them any time soon. Here she explains why enterprises are adapting COBOL apps to meet modern business requirements instead of replacing them altogether.</p>
<h4>Keep learning</h4>
