<div>
<p><em>TechBeacon</em>&#8216;s special report, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/next-generation-esm-?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next-generation ESM: The evolution of service management in the enterprise</a>,&#8221; offers the latest insights on how enterprise service management is transforming the enterprise.</p>
<p>This essential guide looks at <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/extend-it-service-management?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">how enterprise service management (ESM) has evolved </a>over the last 30 years, how IT service management (ITSM) led to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/esm-essentials?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">the emergence of ESM</a>, and where the discipline goes from here. It also provides best practices for creating your own converged service management (CSM) infrastructure. Here are five important takeaways.</p>
<h3>1. ESM evolved from ITSM</h3>
<p>The first help desks were purely reactive services. If something broke, the affected employee filed a support request ticket, and eventually a technician was dispatched to fix the problem based on its severity—or, more commonly, based on the overall workload of an often-overworked tech support staff.</p>
<p>With the formalization in the late 1980s of the <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-itil4-sre-align-devops" rel="noopener noreferrer">Information Technology Infrastructure Library</a> (ITIL)—a set of practices to align IT services with business needs—the concept of <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/it-service-management-tb/automation-ai-itil-itsm" rel="noopener noreferrer">IT service management</a> was born.</p>
<p>ITSM transformed the help desk into a service that provides real, forward-looking value to its customers—the organization&#8217;s internal users. Each of the practices in the ITIL framework can be <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/8-it-service-management-metrics-matter-most" rel="noopener noreferrer">quantified with appropriate metrics</a> to measure the performance of the IT organization in real time and over the long run. Today, ITSM is the de facto standard, streamlining support and service operations to make end users and IT itself more efficient and effective.</p>
<p>ESM essentially takes the concept of ITSM and applies it company-wide. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-hamilton-a5455a34/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Paul Hamilton</a>, managing director of HaloITSM, an ITSM software developer, summarized ESM in the report as &#8220;a complete, end-to-end process in one all-encompassing system with slick communications between departments, an easy procurement process, and the perfect end-result on time, every time.&#8221;</p>
<h3>2. ESM is about more than IT</h3>
<p>From the ESM point of view, a service is a service, and it doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be tied to IT. Whether the service needed is a fix for a broken keyboard, a request for a standing desk, or the onboarding of a new employee, the task can be managed through a centralized portal that offers triage, workflow management, and intelligent automation.</p>
<p>This broader view of services delivers several benefits across the enterprise, including improved cost controls, increased overall efficiency, better accuracy, a simplified data structure, and, crucially, happier employees.</p>
<h3>3. ESM is more about &#8216;single view&#8217; than &#8216;single tool&#8217;</h3>
<p>An effective ESM environment revolves around one core tenet, said <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marilynnelson/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Marilyn Nelson</a>, global head of delivery Success for DXC&#8217;s ServiceNow practice: &#8220;How do we look at multiple transactions through a single pane of glass?&#8221; </p>
<p>By building a consistent data model where all of a business&#8217;s relevant information can be shared, data becomes more holistic, aligning three parties: employees, customers, and management.</p>
<p>Facilitating this will likely require different platforms for each line of business. But Nelson said that&#8217;s okay, since the central point of ESM isn&#8217;t necessarily that a single tool must be used, but rather that all the organization&#8217;s data is migrated to a single data lake.</p>
<h3>4. ESM is an enterprise-wide digital transformation that IT can lead</h3>
<p>Given ESM&#8217;s roots in ITSM, it&#8217;s not unreasonable to believe that the IT organization is the most appropriate choice to lead an ESM implementation. And in modern, progressive organizations, IT has had success doing that.</p>
<p>But the move to ESM is a transformation that touches every corner of the enterprise, often necessitating that the organizational chart be revamped. That requires the highest levels of leadership to be involved. The big challenge is who really owns ESM, said Doug Tedder, principal of Tedder Consulting. Outside of the CEO, there is no one role in the organization that has accountability for end-to-end work flowing through the organization, so this really takes a commitment from senior leadership, he said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The technology part of ESM is easy. The processes are the hard part.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/dougtedder" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Doug Tedder</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s worth considering whether IT can lead your ESM implementation. If so, it will need the support of your CIO and rank-and-file workers to ensure its success.</p>
<h3>5. AI will drive the next evolution of service management</h3>
<p>Converged service management will be the next evolution of ESM. The idea is for CSM to further centralize business services and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/it-service-management-how-it-tools-practices-are-evolving" rel="noopener noreferrer">fulfill service requests more quickly and with less effort</a>.</p>
<p>The discipline is still in its formative phase, but key enablers have already been identified: virtual agents and robotic process automation (RPA) to handle service requests; machine learning to identify patterns in user requests; and the holy grail, a single, user-friendly portal experience for multiple services.</p>
<p>The transition to CSM will be even more daunting than was the ESM transformation. It will require new ways of undertaking fundamental business processes, complex new technologies, and the talent to develop, implement, and manage new tools.</p>
<p>But the challenge of unifying all business lines is an essential part of the process, said DXC&#8217;s Nelson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the journey that makes digital transformation come to life.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Visual regression testing is an effective way to make sure your app is behaving the way you want it no matter the technology stack. As someone who comes from the JavaScript and <a target="_blank" href="https://jamstack.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamstack</a> world, I want to be able to use modern tooling to make sure my dynamic web apps are reliable and maintaining a high level of quality.</p>
<p>I recently joined Applitools as a Developer Advocate. With my role, it will be crucial for me to have a good understanding of not just how to install Applitools and the suite of features we provide, but I’ll need to be able to thoroughly understand how it fits into a developer’s workflow from installation to implementation.</p>
<p>In this stream, I take my first dive into building a new React app from the ground up with <a target="_blank" href="https://nextjs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js</a>. I then walk through installing JavasScript testing framework <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cypress.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cypress</a>, giving me the ability to run end-to-end testing for my new app. Finally, I install and set up <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/products-eyes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitool Eyes</a> which provides me visual regression testing capabilities baked right into my testing suite.</p>

<p>From time to time, we revisit blog posts that show the benefit of Applitools across different use cases. This post by Bilal Haidar from 2019 was one of the first outlining the benefits of Applitools Ultrafast Grid. </p>
</blockquote>
</figure>
<p>Recently I’ve put together a bunch of tutorials: <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@thisdotmedia/applitools-the-automated-visual-regression-testing-framework-18ebada47977" rel="noreferrer noopener">an overview of Applitools</a>, how to <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.angularindepth.com/mixing-storybook-with-angular-with-a-sprinkle-of-applitools-8413bb950cf8" rel="noreferrer noopener">test Storybook with Angular</a>, how to <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/troubleshoot-fix-react-bugs?utm_term=td&amp;utm_source=organic-social&amp;utm_medium=bing&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=ELC-bilal-article&amp;utm_subgroup=bilal-new-article" rel="noopener noreferrer">quickly troubleshoot bugs in React apps</a>, and how to <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/test-vuejs-cypress-io-applitools?utm_term=&amp;utm_source=web-referral&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_campaign=blog-evergreen-campaign&amp;utm_subgroup=" rel="noopener noreferrer">test Vue apps with Cypress</a>.</p>
<p>If you’ve gone through these, you’ll notice that the visual tests complete in seconds — faster than Nic Cage can jack your ride.</p>
<p>How so fast?</p>
<p>The answer is simple: <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/visualgrid?utm_term=&amp;utm_source=web-referral&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_campaign=blog-evergreen-campaign&amp;utm_subgroup=" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools Ultrafast Grid</a>. Each time you run a visual test in Applitools, Ultrafast Grid renders that page across a broad range of browsers and configurations. In parallel. In seconds.</p>
<p>Applitools Visual AI then grabs a screenshot of each page, compares it to its baseline screenshot, and determines visual differences and the <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/root-cause-analysis?utm_term=&amp;utm_source=web-referral&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_campaign=blog-evergreen-campaign&amp;utm_subgroup=" rel="noopener noreferrer">root cause</a> unpinning them. In less than a minute, your cross-browser testing is done and your developers have what they need to fix any visual bugs.</p>
<p>It’s our very own <a target="_blank" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/02/07/tesla-model-s-ludicrous-acceleration-record/" rel="noreferrer noopener">ludicrous mode</a> (a.k.a. how a Tesla can go from zero to 60 mph in a little over two seconds).</p>
<p>But more than a cool technical trick, Ultrafast Grid can help you keep your app development projects on schedule.</p>
<p>In this article, I will demonstrate the Ultrafast Grid system with test runs and a variety of configuration settings, such as multiple browsers, viewports, and devices, to show Applitools’ efficiency in delivering results.</p>
<p>First off, make sure you have the following installed and configured on your machine:</p>
<p>Before we delve into writing code, let’s take a behind-the-scenes look at how Applitools Ultrafast Grid works.</p>
<h2 id="h.oa1yj6tgce4t">Life before Ultrafast Grid</h2>
<p>Before the arrival of the Ultrafast Grid, visual tests were run in this specific order:</p>
<ul>
<li>A test run checked the pages one by one.</li>
<li>A screenshot was taken for each page.</li>
<li>The screenshot was uploaded to the backend server, where it was analyzed (that is, compared to previous baselines).</li>
<li>Based on the results, the test would either fail or keep running, checking other pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far, so good!</p>
<p>But problems arise when hundreds of screenshots are uploaded to the backend server to be analyzed. Varying parameters ranging from different viewports, different browsers, and different device emulators can also slow things down.</p>
<p>To help solve this, Applitools designed the Ultrafast Grid system to run tests quickly.</p>
<h2 id="h.9lfxz8ckycnr">Life with Ultrafast Grid</h2>
<p>Applitools Ultrafast Grid is split into two components: server-side and client-side. Here’s a diagram of how it works:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>
<p>The Ultrafast Grid client is a Node JS library, used internally by both Applitools Storybook and Cypress SDKs. Here’s <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/applitools/visual-grid-client" rel="noreferrer noopener">more on the Ultrafast Grid client</a>.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/bhaidar/753b282427ab1a894d2d9f99f29a7adc.js</p>
</div>
<p>That code snippet instantiates a new Ultrafast Grid client and returns an object. In this case, we are only interested in the <strong>openEyes()</strong> method returned.</p>
<p>When called, the <strong>openEyes()</strong> method starts a new test run and sends the Ultrafast Grid backend server details about it– including, but not limited to the application name, batch or test name, the browsers used, and different variations of browser settings to be adapted while running the tests. This method returns a Promise to an object with the following functions: <strong>checkWindow()</strong> and <strong>close()</strong>.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/bhaidar/37e90b0c5e58acd709268128635d1167.js</p>
</div>
<p>This method call instructs the Ultrafast Grid backend server to prepare a testing environment for a new test run that requires running the test over two different browsers. The first browser emulates an iPhone X, while the second specifies the desktop viewport to run the test.</p>
<p>To start collecting snapshots, the test issues a call to <strong>checkWindow()</strong> function. The Ultrafast Grid client handles this call and collects all the needed resources to store the snapshot locally.</p>
<p>At the end of the test, you issue a call to <strong>close() </strong>method to close and finish the test run.</p>
<p>At this moment, all the DOM Snapshots collected locally during the test run are sent to the Ultrafast Grid backend server. Based on the test run requirements, sent previously with the <strong>openEyes()</strong> method, the Ultrafast Grid:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launches a number of browsers with different viewports and device emulators.</li>
<li>Runs all of the DOM snapshots in parallel.</li>
<li>Collects image screenshots.</li>
<li>Sends all the screenshots to the Applitools AI server to do all the testing analysis and returns the results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, it’s worth mentioning that Ultrafast Grid sits behind a family of Applitools SDKs including the following:</p>
<p>Now that you understand how the Ultrafast Grid system works so efficiently, let’s throw a spanner in the works by running tests with a variety of browser configuration settings. Then, we’ll review the results on the Applitools Test Manager.</p>
<h2 id="h.yf0udzbnle5">Source code</h2>
<p>For this article, I’ve chosen to write a few Storybook stories and use Applitools for the custom Angular ContentEditable component. I’ve described and used this in my previous article on <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.angularindepth.com/mixing-storybook-with-angular-with-a-sprinkle-of-applitools-8413bb950cf8" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mixing Storybook with Angular with a sprinkle of Applitools</a>.</p>
<p>There have been some changes to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@applitools/eyes-storybook" rel="noreferrer noopener">Applitools Eyes SDK for Storybook</a> npm package since my previous article was published. I’d recommend removing the old package and installing the new one by following these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Remove the old @applitools/eyes.storybook NPM package by issuing the following command:</p>
<pre id="code-snippet-0" class="wp-block-preformatted">npm remove @applitools/eyes.storybook</pre>
<p>copy code to clipboard</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Install the new @applitools/eyes-storybook NPM package by issuing the following command:</p>
<pre id="code-snippet-1" class="wp-block-preformatted">npm i @applitools/eyes-storybook</pre>
<p>copy code to clipboard</p>
<p>That’s it!</p>
<h2 id="h.j9tyt4f74r8e">Applitools Ultrafast Grid Demo</h2>
<p>Before writing our tests, let’s run the application and make sure it’s working fine.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Clone the application <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thisdot/storybook-angular-applitools" rel="noreferrer noopener">repo</a>.</p>
<pre id="code-snippet-2" class="wp-block-preformatted">git clone https://github.com/thisdot/storybook-angular-applitools.git</pre>
<p>copy code to clipboard</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Install all app dependencies by issuing the following command:</p>
<p>Go to the folder /storybook-angular-applitools then run this command:</p>
<pre id="code-snippet-3" class="wp-block-preformatted">npm install</pre>
<p>copy code to clipboard</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Run the app by issuing the following command:</p>
<pre id="code-snippet-4" class="wp-block-preformatted">ng serve</pre>
<p>copy code to clipboard</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1.png" alt="1" class="wp-image-4529"/></figure>
<p>Now that we are sure the application is up and running switch back to the Terminal and hit Ctrl+c twice. This terminates the running application.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Run the Storybook stories by issuing the following command:</p>
<pre id="code-snippet-5" class="wp-block-preformatted">npm run storybook</pre>
<p>copy code to clipboard</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2.png" alt="2" class="wp-image-4533"/></figure>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Run the Applitools Eyes SDK for Storybook by issuing the following command:</p>
<pre id="code-snippet-6" class="wp-block-preformatted">npx eyes-storybook</pre>
<p>copy code to clipboard</p>
<p>Make sure you get an <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/storybook-angular.html#how-it-works" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitool API Key</a> and store it on your machine.</p>
<p>To set the APPLITOOLS_API_KEY environment variable locally on your machine you can use the <strong>export</strong> command on Mac OS or <strong>set</strong> command on Windows as follows.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/bhaidar/0b56806977ea420f54be071c8057bec3.js</p>
</div>
<p>For a complete tutorial on how to install and run Applitools Storybook SDK for Angular, check out this article: <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/storybook-angular.html?utm_term=&amp;utm_source=web-referral&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_campaign=blog-evergreen-campaign&amp;utm_subgroup=#how-it-works" rel="noopener noreferrer">Storybook Angular Tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>Back to the command above, this command simply opens the Storybook stories, runs them one by one, and then sends all the DOM snapshots to Applitools Ultrafast Grid, which then renders them.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/3.png" alt="3" class="wp-image-4538"/></figure>
<p>If you expand the first test run, you get the following results:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/4.png" alt="4" class="wp-image-4537"/></figure>
<p>Now that the app, Storybook stories, and Applitools are running locally, let’s start playing with our visual tests.</p>
<h2 id="h.fw6ffceeh5us">Visual UI tests with custom viewports</h2>
<p>Keeping in mind that Applitools with Storybook doesn’t need any kind of configuration, the important test configurations are auto-inferred by Applitools. However, if you want to play around with the test configuration, you have two options to specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Environment variables</li>
<li>The <strong>applitools.config.js</strong> file</li>
</ul>
<p>For this demonstration, I will make use of the applitools.config.js file. For a full list of test configuration, check the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/applitools/eyes-storybook#advanced-configuration" rel="noreferrer noopener">Advanced Configuration</a> section on the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/applitools/eyes-storybook" rel="noreferrer noopener">@applitools/eyes-storybook</a> repo on Github.</p>
<p>When you’re using Applitools with Storybook, there’s no need to add any specific Applitools commands or set test configuration to enable visual testing.</p>
<p>Applitools Eyes SDK runs the Storybook stories, takes a snapshot of each, and sends the DOM snapshots to the Ultrafast Grid backend server. It saves the test run with the default test configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Add a new JavaScript file to the root of your application. Give it a name of applitools.config.js.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Add the <strong>appName</strong> and <strong>batchName</strong> configuration settings as follows:</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/bhaidar/0de19b72bcbe662ecab76f0ff564ad6e.js</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Run the test case on two different browsers with two different viewports by adding the following:</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/bhaidar/f14a44719643ec2fb56ea99420273b4d.js</p>
</div>
<p>Consequently, Ultrafast Grid launches a set of instances for each of the browsers and runs the tests simultaneously. The first time these tests are run, we create baseline images to compare against during subsequent test runs.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Save and run the tests again by issuing the following command:</p>
<pre id="code-snippet-7" class="wp-block-preformatted">npx eyes-storybook</pre>
<p>copy code to clipboard</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Check the test run in Applitools Test Manager.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-23.34.25.png" alt="Screenshot 2019 03 25 at 23.34.25" class="wp-image-4535"/></figure>
<p>I’ve switched the Test Manager view to the Batch Summary View.</p>
<p>Notice how Applitools Ultrafast Grid ran your tests twice, as per the test configuration file above. The test configuration above specified two different browsers with two different viewports. This means that the Ultrafast Grid runs every test twice– once per browser configuration set.</p>
<p>Running this test yields an <strong>execution time of just four seconds</strong>! To be clear, this is what we spent rendering baseline images, once the DOM snapshots were uploaded. Even so, that’s really fast.</p>
<p>It’s the duty of the Ultrafast Grid to analyze the test configuration file attached to the test and spawn, in parallel, a number of browser instances to handle the test run efficiently.</p>
<h2 id="h.cnwn9ukphuox">Visual UI tests with device emulation</h2>
<p>Let’s run another test. This time, instead of specifying the browser viewports, we will specify a device emulation for the browser. Device emulation uses a Chrome browser, with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp" rel="noreferrer noopener">viewport</a> dimensions, and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent" rel="noreferrer noopener">user agent string</a>, specific to that device.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Replace the content of the <strong>applitools.config.js file </strong>with the following configuration:</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/bhaidar/e0a875c7d0d808509c6a5795b20beb29.js</p>
</div>
<p>In this test configuration, we are specifying to the Ultrafast Grid to run this test over a <strong>Chrome</strong> browser with a device emulation of an <strong>iPhone X </strong>using a <strong>landscape</strong> screen orientation.</p>
<p>Ultrafast Grid supports only the Chrome browser for running tests over a device emulation, so you can skip the name of the browser. I’m explicitly specifying the browser name to make it very clear that this is a browser emulation and not a real device.</p>
<p>For a complete list of device emulators supported by the Chrome browser, take a look at this page: <a target="_blank" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chromium/chromium/0aee4434a4dba42a42abaea9bfbc0cd196a63bc1/third_party/blink/renderer/devtools/front_end/emulated_devices/module.json" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chromium Device Emulators</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Save and run the tests by issuing the following command:</p>
<pre id="code-snippet-8" class="wp-block-preformatted">npx eyes-storybook</pre>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Check the test run in Applitools Test Manager.</p>

<p>I’ve switched the Test Manager view to the Batch Summary View.</p>
<p>As per the new test configuration file, the Ultrafast Grid runs your tests on a <strong>Chrome</strong> browser with a <strong>device emulation</strong> for iPhone X. Hence, the browser name shown is Safari 11.0 and <strong>landscape</strong> with a viewport of 812×375.</p>
<p>Notice that running this test yields an <strong>execution time of just two</strong><strong> seconds</strong>! Again, this is once the DOM snapshot has been uploaded. But still…</p>
<p>Finally, in Applitools, baseline snapshots are stored as per test configuration settings. Different test configuration settings generate different baseline snapshots. You can’t compare apples to oranges, right?</p>
<p>That’s why, if you click on the snapshot above (after switching back to Batch steps view) and show both the baseline and the current test run, you won’t get any baseline snapshot–because it’s the first time we’re running the test with these configuration settings.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/7.png" alt="7" class="wp-image-4531"/></figure>
<h2 id="h.qmsf757a6cn1">100 Visual UI tests</h2>
<p>Let’s go crazy and run 100 Visual/UI tests with a combination of test configurations.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Replace the content of the <strong>applitools.config.js file </strong>with the following configuration:</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/bhaidar/5d31686b2e5c7087cb20e9b1188c1d6b.js</p>
</div>
<p>In this test configuration, we are running 100 tests with 50 unique view ports on two major browsers: Firefox and Google Chrome.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Save and run the tests by issuing the following command:</p>
<pre id="code-snippet-9" class="wp-block-preformatted">npx eyes-storybook</pre>
<p>copy code to clipboard</p>
<p>During this time, the Eyes Storybook SDK will read all Storybook stories in the application, run them one by one using the Storybook engine, generate a DOM snapshot for each test, and finally upload the results to the Eyes server. At this moment, the Eyes server will run each and every DOM snapshot, render an image snapshot, and store it as a baseline snapshot.</p>
<p>The Eyes SDK/Server <strong>took only 21 seconds</strong> to complete all the above tasks, create baselines, and report the results on Applitools Test Manager Dashboard, for the entire batch of 100 test runs for a single Storybook story.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-03-28-at-22.54.11.png" alt="Screenshot 2019 03 28 at 22.54.11" class="wp-image-4541"/></figure>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Check the test run in <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/getting-started-with-applitools-eyes-test-manager?utm_term=&amp;utm_source=web-referral&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_campaign=blog-evergreen-campaign&amp;utm_subgroup=" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools Test Manager</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-03-28-at-23.02.24.png" alt="Screenshot 2019 03 28 at 23.02.24" class="wp-image-4534"/></figure>
<p>I’ve switched the Test Manager view to the Batch Summary View.</p>
<p>Let’s see the power of the Eyes server when running a regression testing cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Let’s introduce a visual change on the Storybook story and run the Eyes SDK once again.</p>
<p>Replace the content of the /src/stories/index.stories.js file with the following:</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/bhaidar/e1805b5a9e6402aca9145ca4b2bf6aed.js</p>
</div>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/bhaidar/e1805b5a9e6402aca9145ca4b2bf6aed/raw/5c056b2c1bac4832afb3dad15f4c3ba56829c804/regression-testing-cycle" rel="noopener noreferrer">view raw</a><a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/bhaidar/e1805b5a9e6402aca9145ca4b2bf6aed#file-regression-testing-cycle" rel="noopener noreferrer">regression-testing-cycle</a> hosted with <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></p>
<p>Now the ContentEditableComponent should render with a Blue background.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Run the tests again by issuing the following command:</p>
<pre id="code-snippet-10" class="wp-block-preformatted">npx eyes-storybook</pre>
<p>copy code to clipboard</p>
<p>Once again, the Eyes SDK/Server <strong>took only 21 seconds</strong> to upload the DOM snapshot, run the entire batch of visual UI tests, and display the results on the Applitools Test Manager Dashboard.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-03-28-at-23.09.17.png" alt="Screenshot 2019 03 28 at 23.09.17" class="wp-image-4540"/></figure>
<p>Notice the error message generated saying that “A total of 100 differences were found”.</p>
<p>Because the change we introduced affected the entire batch of test runs, therefore, all the current tests failed in comparison with the baseline snapshots, due to the visual change introduced earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Check the test run in <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/getting-started-with-applitools-eyes-test-manager?utm_term=&amp;utm_source=web-referral&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_campaign=blog-evergreen-campaign&amp;utm_subgroup=" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools Test Manager</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-03-28-at-23.13.38.png" alt="Screenshot 2019 03 28 at 23.13.38" class="wp-image-4530"/></figure>
<p>The Test Manager highlights the differences between the baseline snapshot and the current test run and displays a mismatch icon near the snapshots.</p>
<p>At this moment, you can either accept the new changes and make them the new baseline or reject them and keep the old baseline.</p>
<p>Once again, it takes the power of the Ultrafast Grid to analyze the test configuration file and set up the testing environment as needed.</p>
<h2 id="h.u0m3jav03oip">See for yourself</h2>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step tutorial video of how I did all the steps above. You can see how it took <strong>just 20 seconds for</strong> the Applitools Storybook SDK to upload all the DOM snapshots, then use Applitools Visual AI to look for visual regressions:</p>

<div>
<p>In 2016, Microsoft released a prototype chatbot on Twitter. The automated program, dubbed Tay, responded to tweets and incorporated the content of those tweets into its knowledge base, riffing off the topics to carry on conversations.</p>
<p>In less than 24 hours, Microsoft had to yank the program and issue an apology after the software started <a target="_blank" href="https://gizmodo.com/here-are-the-microsoft-twitter-bot-s-craziest-racist-ra-1766820160" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">spewing vile comments</a>, including &#8220;I f**king hate feminists&#8221; and tweeting that it agreed with Hitler. Online attackers had used crafted comments to pollute the machine-learning algorithm, exploited a specific vulnerability in the program, and recognized that the bot frequently would just repeat comments, a major design flaw.</p>
<p>Microsoft apologized, and Tay has not returned. &#8220;Although we had prepared for many types of abuses of the system, we had made a critical oversight for this specific attack,&#8221; the company <a target="_blank" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2016/03/25/learning-tays-introduction/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">stated in its apology</a>. &#8220;As a result, Tay tweeted wildly inappropriate and reprehensible words and images.&#8221;</p>
<p>AI is increasingly finding its way into software—including <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/state-of-secops-tb/ai-soc-best-practices?lx=ipOpkU&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">software used in security operations centers</a>. Attacks on artificial-intelligence and ML systems are often thought to be theoretical, but significant attacks have already happened. Software developers who use ML models in their programs, and data scientists who develop the models, need to take such malicious behavior into account when creating ML-powered software.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no hard-and-fast defensive playbook yet, said Jonathan Spring, a senior member of the technical staff of the CERT Division at Carnegie Mellon University&#8217;s Software Engineering Institute.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure there is &#8216;type this on the keyboard&#8217; level advice yet. But there is operational-level advice that you can follow to make the systems more robust against failure.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-jono-spring-586a6318/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jonathan Spring</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are five recommendations experts who are focused on AI threats say should guide developers and application security professionals.</p>
<h3>1. Build awareness of the threat with your team</h3>
<p>While adversarial ML attacks are the focus of a great deal of academic study, they are not just theoretical or an exercise <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">using &#8220;spherical cows.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>In 2019, for example, researchers discovered a way to use targeted emails to discover the characteristics for the algorithm that messaging-security firm Proofpoint used to block malicious emails. The attack allowed two security researchers to design a system that replicated the AI model and then use that reconstituted model, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/moohax/Proof-Pudding" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">dubbed Proof Pudding</a>, to find ways to avoid spam detection.</p>
<p>As the attacks—and others cited in this article—show, meaningful adversarial ML attacks are already here. Developers need to build awareness on their teams and find ways to make deployed models more robust, said Mikel Rodriguez, director of the decision-science research programs at MITRE, a not-for-profit government research contractor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;People sometimes see cute articles about turning a stop sign into a yield sign, and they think these attacks are not relevant to them. We first need to convince the community that this is a credible threat.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikel-rodriguez/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mikel Rodriguez</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2. Use tools to eliminate the low-hanging fruit</h3>
<p>While practical attacks generally require a lot of research, a trio of open-source toolkits can get DevSecOps practitioners started testing their models. Three Python libraries—<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CleverHans</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bethgelab/foolbox" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FoolBox</a>, and the<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> Adversarial Robustness Toolbox</a>—allow developers to create examples.</p>
<p>Like static analysis and automated vulnerability scanning, these libraries should be considered the low-hanging fruit—tools that every developer should use against an AI model to make sure it is robust and not prone to attack or failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If you have an ML system, those tools have relatively simple—but still complicated—APIs that let you test your model against known common attack patterns. If you use those, and try to make the system more robust against what you find, you will be doing better than most.&#8221;<br />—Jonathan Spring</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>3. Model threats and attack your AI system</h3>
<p>Companies should attack their own systems to find weaknesses and potential information leakage. Microsoft, for example, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mitre/advmlthreatmatrix/blob/master/pages/case-studies-page.md#microsoft---edge-ai" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">used a red team</a> to analyze its service for running AI workloads at the edge, first gathering information on the product and then querying a public version to infer the responses of the ML model. The knowledge and responses were enough for the red team to build an automated system to modify images in a way that caused the system to misclassify the data without being noticeable to humans.</p>
<p>In other cases, researchers have shown that you can extract data from the model using targeted attacks and inference. An ML model that is made available through an API can be used to recreate the model—essentially allowing the intellectual property to be stolen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If you are a company with a production machine-learning system, you want to have a red team, even if it is small. So you need to look at the system level to see what you can do in order to raise the cost to the attacker.&#8221;<br />—Mikel Rodriguez</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MITRE has collaborated with Microsoft and other organizations to create the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mitre/advmlthreatmatrix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Adversarial ML Threat Matrix</a> as a way to create common language of potential threats.</p>
<h3>4. Use multiple models or algorithms as a check</h3>
<p>Production anti-spam engines use aggregate scores from several algorithms to create a more robust way of classifying messages. Similarly, combining different models—or even the same model trained on different datasets, a technique known as ensemble learning—can produce more robust results.</p>
<p>In addition, using ongoing checks of results—such as users identifying faces in a photo on Facebook—to improve classification or performance can also help.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If there is an immediate test of efficacy of the expert system—whether AI or human—that is very easily conducted and very correct, it does not matter what the system is doing. This is the case with anti-spam systems. The user gives feedback to the system by marking messages as spam or not spam.&#8221;<br />—Jonathan Spring</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>5. Beware of bias</h3>
<p>No matter how good the ML model may be, if the developer trains the system on a biased dataset, it will not be robust to attack or errors. Facial-recognition models that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/19/federal-study-confirms-racial-bias-many-facial-recognition-systems-casts-doubt-their-expanding-use/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">do not perform well in identifying the faces of Black or Brown subjects</a> or the <a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/misinformation-and-biases-infect-social-media-both-intentionally-and-accidentally-97148" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">inherent bias of social media</a> toward divisive speech or &#8220;clickbait&#8221; headlines are examples of bias, in the training datasets or in the algorithms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;There is a lot of research that needs to be done. People may want to focus on only using ML systems in applications where they can immediately check the result.&#8221;<br />—Jonathan Spring</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entire field of search-engine optimization is essentially about finding ways to attack algorithms for the benefit of the attacker.</p>
<h3>Follow the money</h3>
<p>The flourishing of that field underscores that when there is money involved, attacks will proliferate, said MITRE&#8217;s Rodriguez:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;What we are seeing is that you can game the system. And if machine-learning models are the weak point, attackers will focus on that.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Keep learning</h4>
