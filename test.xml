<p><strong>Apple and Google are under fire yet again</strong> for allowing scam apps into their curated app stores: Apple for permitting useless clone apps that sneakily charge recurring fees, and Google for not dealing with once-good apps that go rogue.</p>
<p><strong>There are no good app stores.</strong> There, I said it. Change my mind.</p>
<p><strong>It’s all about the mighty dollar.</strong> In this week’s <i><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/contributors/richi-jennings" rel="noopener">Security Blogwatch</a></i>, we follow the money.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://richi.uk/" rel="noopener nofollow" title="Richi Jennings">Your humble blogwatcher</a> curated these bloggy bits for your entertainment. Not to mention: <em>BOOM.</em></p>
<h3>A plague on both your houses</h3>
<p><strong>What’s the craic?</strong> Dan Goodin reports—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/android-barcode-scanner-with-10-million-downloads-infects-users/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Android barcode scanner with 10 million+ downloads infects users</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Barcode Scanner, one of dozens of such apps available in the official Google app repository, began its life as a legitimate offering. Then in late December … ads were opening out of nowhere. … An update delivered in December included code that was responsible for the bombardment.<br />…<br />Google [has] removed the app. … So far, however, Google has yet to use its Google Play Protect tool to remove the app from devices that had it installed. … Anyone who has a barcode scanner installed on an Android device should inspect it.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>How can we tell?</strong> Thomas Claburn explainifies—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/08/barcode_scan_app_malwarebytes_update/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Barcode scan app amassed millions of downloads before weird update</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Barcode Scanner, distributed by a London-based company called LavaBird, received an update on December 4, 2020, that appears to have introduced the code in question. … LavaBird&#8217;s now-banished Android app shouldn&#8217;t be confused with ZXing Team&#8217;s Barcode Scanner that remains in the Play Store.<br />…<br />LavaBird … is run by Dmytro Kizema, a resident of Ukraine. [It] was incorporated in March, 2020 [but] those involved appear to have been using variations on that name for several years and have other apps that they use to sell traffic to advertisers.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Who discovered it?</strong> Nathan Collier slightly over-hypes the scale of the problem—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/android/2021/02/barcode-scanner-app-on-google-play-infects-10-million-users-with-one-update/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Barcode Scanner app on Google Play infects 10 million users with one update</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Late last December we started getting a distress call. … One patron, who goes by username Anon00, discovered that it was coming from a long-time installed app, Barcode Scanner. An app that has 10,000,000+ installs from Google Play.<br />…<br />We predict … the update occurred on December 4th. … Malicious code had been added that was not in previous versions of the app. Furthermore, the added code used heavy obfuscation to avoid detection. … We confirmed it had been signed by the same digital certificate as previous clean versions.<br />…<br />It is frightening that with one update an app can turn malicious while going under the radar of Google Play Protect. … Because there are so many other legitimate barcode and QR scanners on Google Play, [here’s the] app information:<br />Publisher: LavaBird LTD<br />App Name: Barcode Scanner<br />MD5: A922F91BAF324FA07B3C40846EBBFE30<br />Package Name: com.qrcodescanner.barcodescanner.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>As opposed to other apps with the same name?</strong> Thus spake <i><a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/android-barcode-scanner-with-10-million-downloads-infects-users/?comments=1&amp;post=39646011#comment-39646011" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">marsilies</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>I use an app called &#8220;Barcode Scanner&#8221; that&#8217;s not the malware app. However, the recent reviews blast it for adware, which I haven&#8217;t noticed. I think having the exact same name has caused some people to post negative reviews on the wrong app.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>As wooped</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26063924" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">wooptoo</a></i>, too: <em>[You’re fired—Ed.]</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>This is possibly tied to the recent assault on the ZXing Barcode scanner app. This is a legit open source app that&#8217;s been recently flooded by 1-star reviews claiming that the app contains malware, probably in order to get users to switch to the other apps.</p>
<p>The funny thing is this app has not been updated since 2019 on the Play Store, so those reviews are clearly bogus. It takes a special kind of scum to slander an open source project in order to push malware.</p>
<p></em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>And this problem isn’t unique to Android.</strong> Tim Hardwick explains—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/scam-apps-ios-making-millions-revenue/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Scam iOS Apps Still Raking in Millions in Revenue on App Store</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>The problem of scam iOS apps has dogged Apple&#8217;s App Store for some years now. … Scammers prey on and exploit the work of genuine app developers. … The developer Kosta Eleftheriou has taken to Twitter to highlight that the problem remains as big as ever in at least some app categories – and also offered iOS users a way to spot them.<br />…<br />According to Eleftheriou, there are several clones of his … app, but one of the most clear non-functional rip-offs … launched with a blank interface and an &#8220;Unlock now&#8221; button. Tapping the button prompted users to confirm an $8/week subscription—for an app that doesn&#8217;t do anything.<br />…<br />[He said] the scam achieved prominence in the App Store by gaming Apple&#8217;s algorithmic ranking system through the purchase of fake ratings and glowing five-star reviews, which bumped it up to the top of its app category. It even advertised its software using his own promotional video.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Old news, I hear you cry?</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26069947" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">alex331</a></i> counts the days:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It&#8217;s been a week since this issue [was] highlighted. And a week since Apple still hasn&#8217;t said a single thing. This is sad.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>IANAL, and neither is</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=18218238&amp;cid=61041426" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Anubis IV</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Not a lawyer here, but it even seems as if there may be a case for fraud. … If they&#8217;re stealing someone else&#8217;s videos, posting them as their own, delivering a non-functioning app, and charging users $8/week for the privilege of using said app, the App Store might be well-served by Apple going after them in court.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Cui bono?</strong> With an eye on Apple’s 30%, <i><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26054879" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">ekurutepe</a></i> blames Tim Apple:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I&#8217;m sure Apple wants to do the right thing but they&#8217;ve set themselves up badly from the top down in this case: Tim Cook has been promising (and delivering) services revenue and subscriber count growth since 2016. If your employer says services revenue growth is the most important thing, people do respond to incentives even if they&#8217;re aware of it or not.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Meanwhile,</strong> what’s the best way to curate an app store? <i><a target="_blank" href="https://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=18208056&amp;cid=61036706" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">arglebargle_xiv</a></i> comment YOU:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Google method is much more economical. Google asks Google Play authors, &#8220;Are you Russian hacker?&#8221; and if reply is &#8220;Nyet!&#8221; then app gets approved.</em></p></blockquote>
<h3>The moral of the story?</h3>
<p>Watch out for scam clones of your app, and for bad reviews targeting similarly named apps.</p>
<h3>And finally</h3>

<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>In November last year, we lost our much-loved family dog. We were all so devasted. Harley was a very handsome black and white Cavoodle who died from a paralysis tick bite after giving us 12 years of love. After lots of tears and weeks of sadness, we have decided it’s time to start our search for another fur baby.</p>
<p>But it seems we are not the only ones in the market for a new puppy. Thanks to COVID and our new very home focussed lives, puppies have been in hot demand since early 2020 and they still are. What better way to deal with lockdown loneliness and a home-based existence than a brand-new ball of fluff!</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks, I’ve spoken to multiple breeders from all around Australia who have over 50 families waiting for a puppy! A Portuguese Water Dog breeder told me yesterday that it would be 2023 before she could offer me a puppy!! So,</p>
<p>And this trend hasn’t gone unnoticed by cybercriminals with <a target="_blank" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/life/2020/11/24/puppy-prices-peak-as-scams-increase-fourfold-on-last-year/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) reporting a four-fold increase in puppy scams in 2020!! In fact, a whopping $1.6 million was scammed from unsuspecting Aussies simply looking for a ball of fur to love between January and October 2020.</a></p>
<p>So, how do you avoid being caught up in a puppy scam and losing money? Here’s what I’m doing to ensure we don’t get swindled while we search for our new puppy:</p>
<h2><strong>1. Take Your Time</strong></h2>
<p>Cybercriminals rely on us being in a rush and not doing our homework. A quick google search for popular dog breeds such as Cavoodles, Labradors or Dachshunds will yield pages of results, not all of them legit!</p>
<p>Scammers are very talented at making their sites look genuine. They will copy photos of puppies and breeders from legitimate sites and will even use certificates and identification numbers from these legitimate breeders too. Quite often the only detail that differs is the contact telephone number and email address.</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram ads are also created using these details too making it very hard to identify what is legitimate and what isn’t.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Do Your Homework</strong></h2>
<p>Doing your due diligence is the best way to prevent becoming a victim of a puppy scam. Even if the person on the end of the phone sounds delightful and the pictures are gorgeous, you owe it to yourself – and your bank account – to ensure you are dealing with a legitimate breeder. Here’s what I recommend you do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google the name of the breeder to ascertain whether they have NOT been caught up in a scam.</li>
<li>Always ring the association that the breeder says they are registered with and crosscheck all the information you have been given.</li>
<li>As most puppies come vaccinated and microchipped, ask the breeder to share contact details of the veterinary clinic the puppy has been to.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>3. Photos and Video Chat</strong></h2>
<p>If you are not able to pick up your pet in person, requesting photos and even a video call with the breeder and your potential puppy is essential.</p>
<p>Ask the breeder for multiple photos of the pet with specific items – this help you ascertain that the pet is real and not photoshopped. A recent newspaper is a great item to suggest.</p>
<p>However, a video call is probably the best way of giving you total piece of mind. Yes, it maybe crazy and noisy but there’s nothing like seeing something with your own eyes to satisfy yourself that it is real and not photoshopped!</p>
<h2><strong>4. Trust Your Gut</strong></h2>
<p>We all have a 6<sup>th</sup> sense and now is the time to use it:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the breeder is trying to push for the sale as they are moving to a new house or are unwell, be suspicious.</li>
<li>If the breeder is putting pressure on you to deposit funds to secure your puppy ASAP, be suspicious.</li>
<li>If the breeder is asking an inflated price for the pet, be suspicious. Do your research so you know what an average asking price would be.</li>
<li>If email communication with breeder has signs of broken English or poor grammar, be very suspicious.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can’t imagine our family without pets. They play such an important, cohesive role and we take such joy in sharing photos of our crazy cats and their weird antics on our family group chat.</p>
<p>Next week, we are going to pickup our new puppy. After much debate about breeds, we have chosen a tri coloured beaglier – male of course! The breeder sounds delightful over the phone and the pictures are gorgeous. But just to ensure total piece of mind, I am driving nearly 7 hours to pick up our new fur baby in person. I’ll be sure to share some photos!</p>
<p>Happy pet shopping!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>As a test automation architect, I am always on the lookout for the best solutions that can help reduce the feedback loop between development and QA. As development cycles speed up, having the ability to release features at breakneck speed has become crucial to the success of many organizations. With software infrastructure becoming ever more complicated, and multiple teams contributing to a single application to accommodate these release cycles, the need for effective solutions to catch bugs as fast as possible has never been greater. Enter Applitools.</p>
<p>Applitools has been making waves across the test community for years now by disrupting the traditional means by which test engineers automate their solutions with more coverage, fewer lines of code, and less time spent toward test maintenance. In a stroke of genius, they have invited engineers worldwide to participate in hackathons leveraging the Applitools Ultrafast Grid to show them firsthand how powerful the tool can be. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote">
<blockquote>

<p><cite>Kerry McKeever</cite></p></blockquote>
</figure>
<p>During my first Applitools hackathon, I set up my framework how I traditionally would for any company requiring strong cross-browser compatibility. To do this, I leveraged Selenium and C#, since that is what stack I had been working on for multiple employers up to that point. My challenge to myself for that hackathon was to see how I could build comparable tests in Applitools with as few lines as possible compared to my core Selenium tests.</p>
<p>Once I completed the solution, I ran an analysis on both projects to see where I stood. These comparisons do not account for the shared framework code for the Driver classes, enums to handle driver types and viewport sizes, page object models, and helper classes used between both solutions – just the test code itself. In the end, <strong>my core Selenium test project contained 845 lines of </strong><strong><em>just</em></strong><strong> test code</strong>.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"></figure>
</div>
<p>Conversely, to execute the same tests with the same, or greater, level of confidence in the solution, <strong>the number of lines written for the Applitools test code was only 174</strong>! </p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/oZdFcDvtmSPFb08SkSOLV-C9vYhnXsmIwTevNWUxmOAElRqxrzkZJbxFMbAcU_rG6bhUl-xNrL2I46SlGJnvn0yv1b6z03I741HQ1jv0TyQTxAIuvmGXH_Xxw2pKHi3JkfRrO6Y" alt="" width="953" height="155"/></figure>
</div>
<p>Though we SDETS do all we can to ensure that we have a robust test framework that is as resilient to change as possible, UI test code, by nature, is flaky. Having to maintain and refactor test code isn’t a possibility, it’s a <strong>promise</strong>. Keeping your test code lean = less time writing and maintaining test code = more time focusing on new application features and implementing other test solutions! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2 id="h-my-challenge-maximize-coverage-minimize-code">My Challenge – Maximize Coverage, Minimize Code</h2>
<p>When I saw the opportunity to join Applitools’ Holiday Shopping Hackathon, I jumped on it. This time, I wanted to challenge myself to create both my solution and test framework in not only as few lines as possible, but also as fast as I possibly could. </p>
<p>Traditionally, building out a test framework takes considerable time and effort. If you are working in Selenium, you can spend hours just building out a proper driver manager and populating your page object models. </p>
<p>Instead, I opted to go another route and use Cypress with my reasoning being two-pronged: 1) Cypress allows for fast ramp up of testing, where you can easily have your tests solution up and running against your application in as little as 5 minutes. <em>Seriously</em>. 2) Cypress is used as the test framework at my current place of employment, and it allowed me to build a functioning POC to showcase the power of Applitools to my colleagues. Win-win!</p>
<p>But there is a caveat…While Cypress allows for cross-browser automation against modern browsers, it does not support Safari or IE11. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f61e.png" alt="😞" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> For many companies with a large client base using one or both of these browsers, this can be a non-starter. But that’s where Applitools comes in.</p>
<p>While Cypress has a browser limitation, Applitools allowed me to leverage the easy, quick setup of test automation in Cypress without sacrificing the ability to run these tests on Safari and IE11. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Essentially, my test runs once with Cypress in a single browser, then Applitools re-renders the DOM from my test execution and runs the test against all browser combinations I specify. No browser limitations, no duplication of tests, in as few lines as possible.</p>
<p>How few? Let me share with you my simple solution that covered all necessary scenarios:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wO_UTUlZNuUGTlChaydxiLja8ejFwQzOYa7CZdLoqS5UrCgyRdh7NJl84mKAtTRRRoE4gRsUnN3BpRmj_0axT5l-bYFHgz7raI9lepn-HLcCMlmfyqwQEM7Fw6Tu3cHnWPcnnGs" alt="" width="984" height="467"/></figure>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TFIXZIDoIvj4ik3hyTbzsGEMj7uVmH97HhGhDSwpia4EeirkdyA914mxkNCkNdScu32yffUk2MeEHr71auJLaMMbcMWRWwdNMS6DPHUe18VxaDTMdjTd_0gOjGApYBSMNSlTAUE" alt=""/></figure>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fZIbCkKaEYkZCpuWF94yIyXj-Fnl8BRtPAkZb6aw2RQucUhYSdr2daa6FlfaoClTvHvbnmSxdmmFcAnwmuRvZ9tODxmvcSRCJb6ipoKwF5cfESWte2eFqvfWU28LFA7oiMj3q8" alt=""/></figure>
<p>That’s it! A whopping 84 lines of very lean code that executes all test scenarios across all supported browsers and viewports. </p>
<h2 id="h-fast-from-concept-to-completion">Fast From Concept To Completion</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously, standing up an automated test solution can easily take hours to lay the groundwork before you write a single test. The best part of leveraging Cypress and Applitools is that it took roughly 1 hour from start to finish including the development of my tests, which is almost unheard of. </p>
<p>Beyond just the speed and ease of using Applitools, having such a powerful and succinct dashboard where you can collaboratively work with the entire development team on bugs is where they really shine. Using AI to intelligently identify discrepancies between a base image and the test run, capturing the DOM for easy debugging, controlling A/B testing for variants of your application, and integrating with CI/CD pipelines <em>and</em> Jira…I could go on. </p>
<p>All these capabilities provide great visibility into the health of a product, and allow product owners, managers, developers and QA engineers to work harmoniously together in management of test flows, bugs, and regressions from a single dashboard. In any organization adopting a shift-left mentality, you really can’t ask for much more. </p>

<div>
<p>I remember the feeling when I submitted my entry for Holiday Shopping Hackathon. Sure, there is always a bit of relief once you wrap something up. But mostly I was just proud that I managed to handle each task from Hackathon instructions. </p>
<p>I wasn’t eyeing any of the prices nor expected to ever hear back from judges. I simply saw Applitools Holiday Shopping Hackathon as a learning opportunity and went for it. This sense of pride was coming from having my learning mission accomplished. </p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote">
<blockquote>
<p>I see a lot of potential of this kind of testing. I recognize the benefit for the current project my team is working on.</p>
<p><cite>–Ivana dilparic</cite></p></blockquote>
</figure>
<p>But Hackathon ended up being much more for me, besides getting fine JavaScript and Cypress practice and getting introduced to this amazing visual testing tool, now I also have lifetime bragging rights and a bit of self esteem boost to keep up with my new tech goals.</p>
<h3 id="h-why-did-i-need-new-tech-goals-in-the-first-place">Why did I need new tech goals in the first place?</h3>
<p>I have been in managerial and leadership roles in IT industry for over 12 years. Even though I hold Master’s degree in Computer Science and my first role after graduation was as Software Engineer, 12 years is a lot of time to not be actively developing software.   </p>
<p>All this time I have been making constant efforts to build and enhance an array of soft skills, to accumulate industry specific knowledge (for at least 5 industries) and to be able to actively participate in tech discussions. It turned out that this was not enough, at least not for the tech part, as I started getting feedback that I am “behind with the tech side”. </p>
<p>One thing was clear, I needed to craft a plan which will turn the things around.</p>
<h3 id="h-the-things-i-tried">The things I tried</h3>
<p>I know by now that the best way to learn something is to start practicing it actively and to combine theory with practice. My work is not leaving me with much room for something like getting hands on experience with new cool frameworks. So all the learning and practicing had to happen in the evenings and over the weekend.</p>
<p>I subscribed to several podcasts and blogs and I handpicked some development courses which seemed related to technologies currently used with my team. I was investing a lot of time and was absolutely sure that there is no significant improvement. Courses I choose were either focused on very basic examples or were too demanding in terms of mandatory coursework. Even if I managed to stretch my time and cover self-assignments, whatever I learned there would fade away shortly because I was not actively using it. </p>
<h3 id="h-then-came-hackathon">Then came Hackathon</h3>
<p>The hackathon just sounded like a good idea. The instructions were very specific; it was very clear what was expected from participants. Timeframe for submission was very generous – since learning about Hackathon, I had several weeks to complete my submission, so I didn’t need to pause on rest of my life and get behind with the sleep (something I have been associating with Hackathons until now).</p>
<p>For <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cypress.io/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cypress</a> part I relied on Introduction to <a target="_blank" href="https://testautomationu.applitools.com/cypress-tutorial/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cypress course</a> from <a target="_blank" href="https://testautomationu.applitools.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Test Automation University</a>. Mr. Gil Tayar did a great job!</p>
<h3 id="h-visual-testing-in-applitools">Visual testing in Applitools</h3>
<p>I admit that I ignored the manual and relied on exploring Applitools myself. Overall, I find the app to be intuitive and easy to use. All information about test runs is very well structured and easy to navigate through. </p>
<p>Multi-browser testing worked like a charm. It took me no time to set this up, and speed of multi-browser testing was more than I hoped for.</p>
<p>For one of Hackathon tasks, I figured out how bugs work. That was straight forward. Potential issues were very obviously highlighted. They scream action.</p>
<p>Another task was related to root causes. I didn’t figure this one in first attempt, but I have obviously excelled on that second try.</p>
<h3 id="h-visual-testing-before-i-knew-applitools">Visual testing before I knew Applitools</h3>
<p>I recall scenarios where QA team on my projects was using Selenium to automate tests. Idea was to automate UI tests as well. </p>
<p>There were too many visual issues which tests were not detecting. Even the issues important for the end user were being undetected by these tests. QA Engineers were explaining the causes for this, coming up with workarounds how to increase the test coverage with limited time investments. This didn’t sit that well with the client.</p>
<h3 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>What can I say, this experience has turned me into advocate for Applitools. I see a lot of potential of this kind of testing. I recognize the benefit for the current project my team is working on. And looking back I see there were many cases over the years where it would have helped QA Engineers I have worked with. It shortens the time to set up UI tests and it probably shortens running time. Plus, it provides better coverage. </p>
<p>Also, I find Test Automation University to be one of the best things that happened in testing community lately. Thank you for doing this, Applitools!</p>
<p>As for my personal development, Hackathon was a great boost for me. It helped me carry on with my learning trajectory. And I expect more Hackathons in my future.</p>
