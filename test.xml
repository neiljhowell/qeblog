<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<h2><strong>Announcing McAfee’s Enhanced Consumer Security for New Consumer Realities</strong></h2>
<p>With millions of people continuing to work and study remotely, scammers have followed them home—generating <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-quarterly-threats-july-2020.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">an average of 375 new threats per minute</a> so far this year. In response, our enhanced consumer portfolio directly addresses the new needs and new threats people face.</p>
<p>McAfee Labs found that these new threats via malicious apps, phishing campaigns malware, and more, according to its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-quarterly-threats-july-2020.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee COVID-19 Threat Report: July 2020</a>, which amounted to an estimated <a target="_blank" href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/federal.trade.commission#!/vizhome/COVID-19andStimulusReports/FraudLosses" rel="noopener noreferrer">$130 million in total losses in the U.S. alone</a>.</p>
<p>To help people stay safer and combat these threats, today we announced our latest consumer security portfolio. Our enriched products come with better user experiences such as a native Virtual Private Network (VPN), along with new features, including integrated Social Media and Tech Scam Protection—all of which are pressing security essentials today.</p>
<p>Specifically, our product lineup has been updated to include:</p>
<h3><strong>Boosts to security and privacy</strong></h3>
<p>Scams involving tech support and product activation have continued to sneak into people’s inboxes and search results, which require a critical eye to spot. Here are some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/top-tips-to-spot-tech-support-scams/?hilite=%27tech%27%2C%27support%27%2C%27scams%27" rel="noopener noreferrer">tips on how to identify these scams</a>. We’re making it easier for people to stay safer with new features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tech Scam Protection:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/safe-browser/mcafee-webadvisor.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee® WebAdvisor</a> now provides a warning when visiting websites that can be used by cybercriminals to gain remote access to your PC, helping combat the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/data-spotlight/2019/03/older-adults-hardest-hit-tech-support-scams" rel="noopener noreferrer"> $55 million total fraud loss in the U.S. due to tech scams</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Malware Detection:</strong> McAfee enhanced its machine learning capabilities to improve overall time to detect emerging threats across devices as well as added protection against file-less threats.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Improvements make it easier for you to stay safer</strong></h3>

					<description><![CDATA[While AIOps is increasingly taking center stage in industry discussions, and for good reason, there is also a great deal]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">While AIOps is increasingly taking center stage in industry discussions, and for good reason, there is also a great deal of confusion about it. Part of this is because the phrase &#8220;artificial intelligence for IT operations&#8221; often leads to debates that confuse use case and value with underlying technology capabilities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The other reason behind the confusion is the diversity of the AIOps market in terms of capabilities, focus, deployment requirements, direction, and overarching design.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As noted in EMA&#8217;s newly released Radar Report: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.enterprisemanagement.com/research/asset.php/3970/EMA-Radar-Report:-AIOps---A-Guide-for-Investing-in-Innovation" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AIOps—A Guide for Investing in Innovation</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Rather than [being] a market in the strictest sense, AIOps might be more accurately described as a &#8216;landscape&#8217; containing within it some rather startling surprises.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">The report examines 17 vendors in depth, based on extensive questionnaires and 31 deployment interviews, and provides the groundwork for the top 10 criteria. Here they are.</p>
<h3>1. Your key requirements</h3>
<p dir="ltr">EMA examined all 17 vendors across three use cases: incident, performance, and availability management; change impact and capacity optimization; and business impact and IT-to-business alignment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We saw striking differences in both focus and design relevant to these and related value propositions, such as integrated support for DevOps or SecOps. So the first thing to do is to understand and document your own unique top priorities before you go looking.</p>
<h3>2. Heuristic range</h3>
<p dir="ltr">While this could be a data scientist&#8217;s extravaganza, EMA evaluated this in large part based on four outcome-driven capabilities: anomaly detection, predictive insights, prescriptive insights (in which recommended actions are defined), and if/then analytics (if you make this change, then what will happen?).</p>
<p dir="ltr">By focusing on vendor strengths in each area, as they match your needs and readiness to go forward, you&#8217;ll have an excellent technical road map for AIOps selection.</p>
<h3>3. Integrated automation</h3>
<p dir="ltr">EMA has seen the handshake between analytics and automation as perhaps the single most transformative technology investment an IT organization can make. AIOps-related automation can be provided by the vendor, or via fully supported third-party sources, or through a mixture of both.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This automation can range from workflow to IT process automation to configuration automation to workload automation—as just four key examples.</p>
<h3>4. Required data and how it&#8217;s managed</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Not surprisingly, data is key for AIOps platforms to do their job well. This can typically include event, time-series data, log files, and other data such as configuration, topology, business-impact data, and even asset- and cost-related data.</p>
<h3>5. What&#8217;s already deployed</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Part of understanding your requirements involves getting a firm handle on what you already have deployed—what&#8217;s working well and the biggest gaps. Most AIOps platforms are designed to assimilate third-party tool sets and bring that data together, while supplementing with data collection capabilities of their own.</p>
<h3>6. Breadth of third-party integrations</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Across all 17 vendors, we saw a wide range in the number of supported integrations for third-party tool sets, from fewer than 10 to more than 100. These integrations typically include monitoring tools for infrastructure and application performance, automation options, IT service management (ITSM), and configuration management (including CMDBs), among other sources. </p>
<h3>7. Discovery and dependency mapping</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Another capability—either directly through the AIOps platform or through integrations—is support for discovery and dependency mapping for critical contextual insights. For instance, many of the platforms also support APM (application performance management) integrations for transaction-aware insights into application-to-infrastructure interdependencies.</p>
<h3>8. Deployment options</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Deployment options can significantly affect pricing, time-to-deploy, and administrative overhead. EMA looked for flexibility in spanning both SaaS and on-premises choices.</p>
<h3>9. Administrative overhead</h3>
<p dir="ltr">EMA’s research indicated a large delta in administrative overhead for ongoing support—not including initial deployment or significant upgrades. Basic ongoing support for an enterprise-size environment (10,000 employees of 5,000 managed entities) ranged from less than 0.5 of a full-time employee to three or more.</p>
<h3>10. Price</h3>
<p dir="ltr">While software costs are critical, they were rarely the most dominant factor in selecting an AIOps platform, based on our interviews. But when costs do inevitably come into play, it&#8217;s important to look at the larger context of administrative costs, deployment costs, and expected time-to-value, as well as the complexity affiliated with software licensing.</p>
<h3>Make <em>your</em> AIOps investment a success</h3>
<p>This list above provides a useful departure point for examining different AIOps platforms, but it&#8217;s also important to take the time to assess your own unique world.</p>
<p>What are your needs? Who are the most critical stakeholders? Where and how do they agree and disagree on their priorities? What process changes are likely to be needed? Do you have top-down executive support to help your IT organization evolve to work in new and more effective ways?</p>
<p>All these things may be relevant to making your AIOps investment a success.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>For deeper insights into what the data shows on how the AIOps market is evolving, with a fresh, in-depth look at all 17 vendors, read the EMA Radar Report: </em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.enterprisemanagement.com/research/asset.php/3970/EMA-Radar-Report:-AIOps---A-Guide-for-Investing-in-Innovation" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AIOps—A Guide for Investing in Innovation</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A guide to notable changes and deprecations for engineers looking to migrate from Selenium 3 to Selenium 4. There is]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<h2 id="h.trd73uc0493p">A guide to notable changes and deprecations for engineers looking to migrate from Selenium 3 to Selenium 4.</h2>
<p>There is huge excitement within the testing community since Simon Stewart, the lead of the Selenium project, announced the release of Selenium 4 with major changes and W3C standardization to the Selenium suite (Selenium IDE, Selenium WebDriver and Selenium Grid) during the official <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypmrrJmgM9U" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium Conference</a> 2018 at Bangalore, India.</p>
<p>As of early September 2020, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/" rel="noopener noreferrer">alpha version of Selenium 4</a> is available and can be downloaded to explore.</p>
<p>Manoj Kumar has already explained at a high level <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/selenium-4/" rel="noopener noreferrer">what’s new in Selenium 4</a>, and in this weekly blog series, we will discuss these features in detail with code snippets, benefits and possible use cases for the end users and well as the dev community who have built tools/products on top of Selenium.</p>
<p id="h.zac1ehcvyxfv">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the deprecated components and their replacements</li>
<li>Plan the migration from Selenium 3 to 4</li>
</ul>
<p>Selenium is a toolset for web browser automation that allows us to remotely control browser instances and emulate a user’s interaction with the browser. There are many changes in Selenium 4, the major being the W3C standardization, which implies that Selenium can be integrated with any software without any compatibility issues. Along with W3C standardization, there are few new methods added and deprecated/replaced.</p>
<p>Let’s discuss these in detail.</p>
<p>There are a couple of deprecations in Selenium 4. Let’s explore them.</p>
<h2 id="h.q3klgov012qo">FindsBy</h2>
<p>FindsBy interfaces are part of org.openqa.selenium.internal package having findElement(By) and findElements(By) methods, implemented by the RemoteWebDriver class. These are now deprecated as part of Selenium 4.</p>
<p>This is an internal change and does not impact end users, however if you have a product or tool built on top of Selenium APIs, have a look into these changes.</p>
<p>The By class can be used with findElement(By) and findElements(By) just like before.</p>

<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/ShamaUgale/0c2e9174680b510315f3feb24c9d4366.js</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h.jg0o7c8ahn0b">Actions</h2>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/interactions/Actions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Actions</a> class is a user-facing API for emulating complex user gestures like hovering, mouse movements, etc.</p>
<p>A few new methods have been added to the Actions class as a replacement of the classes under package org.openqa.selenium.interactions:</p>
<h3 id="h.mj2yxzjlz2t2">click</h3>
<p>A new method click(WebElement) is added to Actions class and is a replacement of moveToElement(onElement).click() and is used to click on an element.</p>
<h3 id="h.2mygl0gk2upp">clickAndHold</h3>
<p>Similarly, clickAndHold(WebElement) is used to click on an element without releasing and should be used as an replacement of moveToElement(onElement).clickAndHold()</p>
<h3 id="h.2qa0whoeiwd">contextClick</h3>
<p>contextClick(WebElement) is a replacement of moveToElement(onElement).contextClick() which was used to right click on an element.</p>
<h3 id="h.wmeymwc5pkoq">doubleClick</h3>
<p>doubleClick(WebElement) is used to double click on an element and is a replacement of moveToElement(element).doubleClick().</p>
<h3 id="h.tusoyvtzya5w">release</h3>
<p>release() is used to release the depressed left mouse button at the current mouse location. This was earlier part of org.openqa.selenium.interactions.ButtonReleaseAction class, and is now moved to Actions class.</p>
<h3 id="h.4s0zg88lo54k">Examples</h3>
<p>The below example demonstrates the usage of Actions methods discussed in Selenium 3 from line 17 to 33.</p>
<p>These methods can be replaced as shown in the below code snippet as part of Selenium 4 implementation from line 37 to 53.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/ShamaUgale/8e5a355017397ad12fd45d0819304ea5.js</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h.fcin1oerapqt">FluentWait</h2>
<p>The methods withTimeout() and pollingEvery() from FluentWait class have been changed. Now both methods accept a single parameter java.time.Duration in replacement of two parameters int and TimeUnit. Lets see the usages.</p>
<p>In the Selenium 3 example below, we see on line 6, the pollingEvery() method takes two parameters int and TimeUnit and can be imported from the package java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit. On line 7, withTimeout() also accepts int and TimeUnit as parameters.</p>
<p>Selenium 4 has replaced the TimeUnit with Duration and here is the sample code snippet demonstrating it. On line 12, pollingEvery() method now accepts only one parameter, Duration.</p>
<p>The Duration class can be imported from the java.time package and has methods to represent time duration in nano, millis, seconds, minutes, hours, days and so on.</p>
<p>In our example we have used ofMillis(int) and ofSeconds(int) methods.</p>
<p>Similarly, on line 14 withTimeout() method accepts Duration as a parameter.</p>

<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/ShamaUgale/cce2da71e0eca5e4240dc88009a2018a.js</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h.ldz60qiklzam">Driver Constructors</h2>
<p>A couple of driver constructors have been deprecated. Namely, the ones that accepted Capabilities objects have been replaced with ones that accept Options.</p>
<p>This means you will need to create a specific Options object for whichever Driver class you’re using, set your requirements and pass this object to the Driver constructor.</p>
<p>Examples for each of the drivers can are below</p>
<h3 id="h.9xw0f7uoe1lc">ChromeDriver</h3>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"></figure>
</div>
<p>ChromeDriver(Capabilities) is replaced by ChromeDriver(ChromeOptions).</p>

<h2 id="h.3bst29ontuje">Summary</h2>
<p>We went through the major deprecations in Selenium 4 and have outlined the ones that are important for end users in their migration from Selenium 3 to 4.</p>
<p>The list of all deprecations can be explored in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/deprecated-list.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium WebDriver API docs</a>. There are considerable internal interfaces, classes and ENUMs deprecated which have no impact on end users but may be of importance to vendors of tools and products built on top of Selenium.</p>
<p>In the next post of this series, we will explore the newly added features offered in Selenium 4 and the benefits they provide.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>When your team moves to a cloud testing solution like Sauce Labs, creating a solid, secure connection is likely to be a top priority.  One of the solutions to this challenge is Sauce Connect proxy. This is a command line tool that your team can use to create a TLS tunnel from your environment out to Sauce. This can be used to test applications that are not publicly facing; for example, if your team needs access to a local host system or a dev or staging environment. So rather than completely change your setup, you can easily download the proxy from Sauce Labs and run your tests from those internal environments. </p>
<p>Having this kind of structure in place gives your team confidence that the applications you&#8217;re testing are secured and easily accessible through Sauce Labs. As a best practice, you should use an identifier for the tunnel. This will assign the tunnel a name which you can use while executing tests so you’re able to tell the tunnels apart. This means you won’t have to constantly update tunnels IDs to replace the random identifier that Sauce Labs assigns. Instead, your  tunnel IDs can be passed as a capability to any test.</p>
<p>If you’re new to setting up proxy tunnels via the cloud, please take a look at one of our Tech Tip videos below. Senior Solutions Engineer Stan Williams walks you through the process of setting up Sauce Connect, how to point it at Sauce Labs, and best practices to follow.</p>
<div class="video">
<p><iframe title="Setting Up Sauce Connect - Sauce Tech Tip" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m2u1Gy14r9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
</div>
<p><b>Best Practice Alert: Keep Sauce Connect Up To Date! </b></p>
<p>Once you’re well established in using Sauce Connect, it’s a good idea to keep your version up to date in order to ensure a more secure and efficient testing practice. To help provide our customers with the most secure testing experience, we will be eliminating our support for Self Signed Certificates, and instead allowing for only Public Certificate Authority Signed Certificates. To achieve this, we are in the process of deprecating all versions of Sauce Connect prior to 4.6.x. If you are using an older version of Sauce Connect, we highly recommend you take a few minutes to download and <a target="_blank" href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwiki.saucelabs.com%2Fdisplay%2FDOCS%2FDownloading%2BSauce%2BConnect%2BProxy" rel="noopener noreferrer">install this update</a>. We also have helpful documentation on <a target="_blank" href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwiki.saucelabs.com%2Fdisplay%2FDOCS%2FBasic%2BSauce%2BConnect%2BProxy%2BSetup" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to set up Sauce Connect</a> that should make this process as smooth as possible. If applicable, please also ensure you are using the latest version of the Sauce Labs Jenkins plugin.</p>
<p>For further information on how to easily set up Sauce Connect, check out our <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.saucelabs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> and our <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Sauce+Connect+Proxy+FAQs" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ page</a>. Happy testing!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">Six months ago, no one anticipated that the way we work and do business would change so drastically. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted every industry, resetting major trends in consumer behavior and forcing businesses to quickly strengthen their technical capabilities to facilitate digitization and a remote workforce.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With these changes, technical leaders are <a target="_blank" href="http://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/digital-transformation-fast-forward-time-adjust-accelerate" rel="noopener noreferrer">facing greater challenges in delivering digital products and services to the market</a>. One challenge that has become even more nuanced is simply finding the right talent. For CTOs and technical leaders, finding the right people to fill gaps in their teams is one of the biggest pain points in building and delivering great products.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are CTOs&#8217; and other technical managers&#8217; recommendations for how to resolve your resourcing issues, now and in a post-pandemic work environment.</p>
<h3>Finding specialized talent is still a major challenge</h3>
<p>Tech changes fast, which means that skill demands also change quickly. Finding talent with specialized skill sets to match product and market demands remains a nagging challenge for hiring managers and CTOs.</p>
<p>Technical talent is still hard to find, particularly for architecture, data science, DevOps, development, and technical management, said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/tonykarrer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tony Karrer</a>, head of the Los Angeles CTO Forum and CTO of Aggregage, which creates online communities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This challenge is often compounded by the need to meet tight deadlines, said Mark Long, principal of independent firm Interna Consulting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;In many instances, you need to find people who have a very specific skill set to meet project needs, and with looming deadlines you need to find those resources now.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markklong/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mark Long</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You simply can&#8217;t hire fast enough through your traditional HR process, Long said. Since speed is a deciding factor, you also don&#8217;t have the time to train members of your team to fill the role, making it difficult to quickly ramp up your team to respond to changes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, disciplines have grown quickly, and as they get deeper and deeper it becomes much harder to find the right candidate and to adequately assess candidates&#8217; knowledge and skill level.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ejgruber/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Eric Gruber</a>, IT manager at Amazon, said cybersecurity is a prime example. The cybersecurity skills shortage is expected to result in 3.5 million unfilled positions by 2021, <a target="_blank" href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/jobs/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">according to Cybersecurity Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>As cybersecurity becomes even more critical due to the threat landscape, &#8220;managers are put in a precarious position of competing for the limited talent to meet the demands &#8230; or finding other creative ways to temporarily fill gaps until more talent becomes available,&#8221; Gruber said.</p>
<h3>Moving beyond technical skills when vetting candidates</h3>
<p>While recruiting specialized talent for product teams is a struggle, that is not the main concern shared by tech leaders. More and more, the emphasis is shifting from hiring for technical skills to finding talented people who have a deeper understanding of what it takes to build the high-quality apps users want, said Amit Nayar, VP of engineering at FloQast.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">While technical skill is definitely important for engineers, being able to think about what users want and use that data to drive development is an extremely valuable skill set.<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nayar_amit" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amit Nayar</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a need for developers and testers who focus on quality, can think like a customer, and can <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/customer-driven-development-3-ways-make-customers-part-rd" rel="noopener noreferrer">make user-driven technical decisions</a>. Managers want team members who go beyond the code and the tools to think about overall product value to customers and to the business.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting the right people on the bus can be a challenge. For an engineering team, you get no points for just shipping a feature; you get points for creating customer value.<br />—Mark Long</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">It is not enough to have testers who just tick off boxes, said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/stevemotola" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Steve Motola</a>, CTO of EntWise, a video ad-tech startup. &#8220;We need people who can understand the product and think about product quality as a whole. Skills in QA design and planning and in creating an end-to-end QA strategy are lacking.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/phalder/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Priyanka Halder</a>, senior manager of QA at GoodRx, agreed. &#8220;More and more, companies are looking for quality advocates rather than just quality engineers,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The ideal candidate&#8217;s profile couples technical aptitude with soft skills such as critical thinking and communication. While these additional criteria make it even more difficult for leaders to recruit the right talent, the consensus is that team members with these attributes add significantly more value to a team.</p>
<p>Creating a better filtering and screening process for these additional qualities is still an area that most hiring managers are trying to figure out. There is a need to go <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahink/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">beyond the traditional coding interviews</a> to be able to discern great talent with the right mix of technical skills and soft skills, said Shahin Mohammadkhani, executive director of enterprise technology at Sony Pictures Entertainment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really looking for two skills: resourcefulness and emotional intelligence. Knowing when to use the right tools and the right tech and understanding the thought process behind it is actually more critical than being an expert in a particular skill set.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahink/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shahin Mohammadkhani</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Now more than ever, it&#8217;s critical to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/3-ways-qa-pros-can-lead-quality-driven-development-devsecops-world" rel="noopener noreferrer">build quality-driven teams</a> where each member is considered a champion of both quality and of the end user. </p>
<h3>Distributed teams and remote work change the game</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, there is no quick fix or one-size-fits-all solution, and the recent acceleration of the remote work culture due to COVID-19 has pushed companies to rethink how they hire and retain team members.</p>
<p dir="ltr">More companies are considering <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/3-things-every-it-org-should-be-doing-get-ahead-pandemic" rel="noopener noreferrer">a move toward distributed teams</a> as a viable way to fill resource gaps. The effects of this change are twofold: For some, it has opened a can of worms, but for others it holds new and exciting opportunities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The concept of remote work isn&#8217;t new in the tech space, but it has been accelerated. Some 48% of employees will likely work remotely at least part of the time after the worst of the virus has passed, versus 30% before the pandemic, according to a recent Gartner poll on<a target="_blank" href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/9-future-of-work-trends-post-covid-19/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> the future of work trends</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sony Pictures Entertainment&#8217;s Mohammadkhani sees the change to remote work as the new normal. &#8220;We&#8217;ve established the technology platforms now for everyone to be remote. By opening up their models to facilitate remote team members, many businesses have expanded opportunities and their reach to the source pool and different markets. Unlike the past, remote is now a preference and no longer an impediment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Halder of GoodRx agreed, adding that finding top testing talent for her company has &#8220;become easier since COVID-19 because of hiring freezes and layoffs from bigger companies. We now have more resources to choose from that weren&#8217;t accessible previously.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other hand, this openness to remote work has unlocked a new level of competition for small and medium-sized companies trying to find great resources for their teams. Large corporations that previously would not have considered hiring remote candidates outside of their city or country for critical roles are now more open to the idea.</p>
<p>This may place startups and small businesses in the precarious position of figuring out how to compete successfully for staff against the perks and lure of working for large Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<h3>COVID-19 is redefining tech team structure and culture</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Going beyond heightened concerns about finding remote tech talent to fill gaps, the COVID-19 pandemic has reset major work trends. Companies now have to rethink not only their workforce planning and employee brand but also their work culture.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to a survey of employees on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ultimatesoftware.com/Contact/the-state-of-remote-work" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">state of remote work by Ultimate Software</a>, 54% of respondents prefer to be remote, 90% <a target="_blank" href="http://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/5-engineering-productivity-lessons-we-learned-during-pandemic" rel="noopener noreferrer">feel more productive</a>, and 50% are less stressed than when they are in office. </p>
<p dir="ltr">But remote work also brings challenges for managers, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Monitoring remote workers&#8217; productivity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Building team morale and balancing the mental pressure of COVID-19 with the pressures of meeting team deliverables</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Finding the right mix of tools and technologies to foster effective communication and seamless collaboration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/pandemic-your-remote-workforce-9-ways-stay-secure" rel="noopener noreferrer">Managing security</a> and access to sensitive data</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Creating a productive and encouraging remote-work culture will be essential for the success of tech teams even in a post-COVID-19 environment.</p>
<h3>Adopting new models for finding top tech talent</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The pandemic has validated that a remote workforce can be just as productive as in-house teams, if managed well. As a result, remote insourcing and outsourcing are gaining traction, especially in markets that have been oversaturated with tech job openings. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Essentially, remote insourcing means that roles that traditionally would have been contracted out are instead being filled internally, but with resources that work remotely.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Access to a wider sourcing pool may help to resolve issues around finding candidates with the right balance of technical expertise and soft skills.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to feedback from the <a target="_blank" href="https://lactoforum.org" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles CTO forum</a>, the major transition since the pandemic is toward hiring more remote talent to build in-house teams. The CTO Forum&#8217;s Karrer said that &#8220;many CTOs have found that they can work effectively with a fully remote team. Further, other executives in the organization have seen a fully remote model working well.&#8221; </p>
<p dir="ltr">The philosophy of requiring everyone to work in the same office has changed dramatically, Karrer said. This means that CTOs are now looking at sourcing talent that would be in the workplace only a few times per year.</p>
<h4>Outsourcing can fill in the gaps</h4>
<p dir="ltr">This can work with outsourcing to fill more difficult roles such as cybersecurity or product quality specialists. This combined hiring approach allows managers to quickly meet skill demands while also managing costs. Managers can hire an outsourced consultant on an as-needed basis instead of taking on a full-time employee and the associated overhead costs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/9-future-of-work-trends-post-covid-19/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">research by Gartner, </a>&#8220;organizations will continue to expand their use of contingent workers to maintain more flexibility in workforce management post-COVID-19.&#8221; Some 32% of organizations are replacing full-time employees with contingent workers as a cost-saving measure, the Gartner study said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/how-cios-can-work-with-outsourcing-providers-to-navigate-the-coronavirus" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> McKinsey report</a> found that the outsourcing industry has been an integral partner in companies&#8217; crisis response across sectors, particularly for the delivery of technology services. Pre-pandemic, the IT outsourcing market was already forecast to reach approximately $413.7 billion by 2021, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1074741/global-market-spend-outsourcing-shared-services-segment/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">according to Statista</a>.</p>
<h3>Key outsourcing challenges</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Finding reputable, trustworthy outsourced experts will be critical. Leaders must commit to doing due diligence in creating an effective screening process that goes beyond just budget and timeline.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other factors such as level of maturity of outsourced resources, thought leadership, contribution to the community, and track record of working with distributed teams are important to consider.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But despite the new challenges that may surface, outsourcing can help resolve some of the major tech talent gaps. This may very well become the new normal for building strong product teams. Companies that are quick to adapt will lead the pack.</p>
<h3>Facing the new normal</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Finding great tech talent is one of the biggest challenges tech leaders face today. The acceleration of remote work culture and related workforce trends has created new opportunities for hiring and finding specialized talent, and the pandemic has proved that remote workforces can be effective.</p>
<p>Companies are moving toward more distributed teams, and access to a greater talent pool through outsourced, distributed resources can also help fill talent gaps. However, you need to be strategic in your approach to building a remote product team.</p>
<p>With the promising opportunities for finding talent that come with this trend, managers must focus on what matters most: Finding talent that will allow them to build a quality-driven team and culture, where delivering customer value matters above all else.</p>

<div>
<p>In this post, we will discuss working with all new <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/14/announcing-testproject-new-opensdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject OpenSDK</a> to write native Selenium code of an existing code which is powered by the following:</p>
<table style="height: 146px; width: 44.791%; border-collapse: collapse; border-style: dotted;">
<tbody>
<tr style="height: 146px;">
<td style="width: 100%; height: 146px;">
<h4><strong>Note</strong></h4>
<p>The <em><strong>native Selenium</strong></em> code which we will be using in this post is available in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/executeautomation/SeleniumWithCucucumber" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2><strong>Native Selenium Code</strong></h2>
<p>The native <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium</a> code that we have as mentioned before is written in BDD format using Cucumber and running the test via the test runner of TestNG. The structure of the code looks pretty much like a regular test code, as below:</p>
<p></p>
<p><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13692 size-full" title="Native Selenium Code Structure" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/codestructure.jpg" alt="Native Selenium Code Structure" width="352" height="732" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/codestructure.jpg 352w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/codestructure-246x512.jpg 246w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px"/></noscript></p>
<p>The code also uses Selenium Page Object Model, TestNG Listeners, and generates reports via Extent reporting. Well, this whole code uses Native Selenium Webdriver to perform UI testing and in fact, with this “usual” approach, we have the following things to be taken care of as a tester <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f92f.png" alt="🤯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain ChromeDriver/Gheckodriver/EdgeDriver, etc with latest versions.</li>
<li>Write your own code for reporting (like extent reporting in this case).</li>
<li>Maintain browser drivers in CI/CD deployment machines.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Using TestProject’s OpenSDK</strong></h2>
<p>Using <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a>‘s OpenSDK, now things are much simpler and it addresses the above pain points along with a lot of fascinating features! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic test reports in HTML/PDF format (including screenshots).</li>
<li>Collaborative reporting dashboards with execution history and RESTful API support.</li>
<li>Always up-to-date with the latest and stable Selenium driver version.</li>
<li>A simplified, familiar syntax for both web and mobile applications.</li>
<li>Complete test runner capabilities for both local and remote executions, anywhere.</li>
<li>Cross-platform support for Mac, Windows, Linux and Docker.</li>
<li>Ability to store and execute tests locally on any source control tool, such as Git.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Migrating Native code to TestProject OpenSDK</strong></h2>
<p>The first and foremost operation before beginning with our code migration is to get the OpenSDK itself. Since this is a Java Maven project, the reference we are going to set in the POM.xml file is going to look something like this:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null"><dependency>
    <groupId>io.testproject</groupId>
    <artifactId>java-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>0.63.2-RELEASE</version>
</dependency></pre>
<p>Next, the only code change we need to make in our native selenium code to use TestProject’s OpenSDK is this:</p>
<p><strong>Native code</strong></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">//Chrome driver - Using Native Selenium WebDriver
System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "/Users/ChromeDriver/chromedriver");
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
</pre>
<p><strong>TestProject OpenSDK</strong></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">WebDriver driver = new DriverBuilder<ChromeDriver>(new ChromeOptions())
        // Get Project Name from environment variable - CI/CD
        .withProjectName(System.getenv("BuildNumber"))
        // Get Job Name as Release Name from environment variable - CI/CD
        .withJobName(System.getenv("ReleaseName"))
        // Get TestProject Auth Token from environment variable - CI/CD
        .withToken(System.getenv("token"))
        .build(ChromeDriver.class);</pre>
<p>As you can see from the above code, the DriverBuilder sets the following parameters to invoke TestProject agent running in the target machine:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project Name</strong> – Which can be any name, but since TestProject’s OpenSDK is going to automatically create the reports, it’s better to set a unique name as the project name. In this case, we are using CI/CD environment variables to set the project name.</li>
<li><strong>Job Name</strong> – Which can be any name as well, but we are setting the <em>release number</em> as job name from CI/CD environment variable.</li>
<li><strong>Token</strong> – This is a super-secret <em>token</em> to authenticate our TestProject agent with the TestProject platform and MUST need to come from CI/CD environment variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this, we can now run our test and get the automatic test report generated in the TestProject Platform as shown below</p>
