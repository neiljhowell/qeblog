					<description><![CDATA[  Overview   Enterprise Service Management (ESM) is a relatively new product category that applies IT Service Management (ITSM) principles,]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p> </p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Enterprise Service Management (ESM) is a relatively new product category that applies IT Service Management (ITSM) principles, practices, and tools to non-IT parts of the business, such as human resources, finance, travel, and facilities. These technologies and practices were originally developed to automate the provisioning of IT services and handle large volumes of IT requests quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-extend-it-service-management-whole-business" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESM takes ITSM a few steps further</a> and is proving to be transformational for organizations of every size. Its implementations are producing extraordinary gains in business efficiency, productivity, and customer satisfaction, and supporting the drive for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/assets/it-operations-management/digital-transformation-and-esm" rel="noopener noreferrer">back-office digital transformation</a>.</p>
<p>For most organizations, the <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/extend-it-service-management?lx=XrrwBl" rel="noopener noreferrer">benefits of ESM</a> make perfect sense. But when teams begin thinking about adoption, two issues often arise that stall their progress:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do you choose suitable projects that will deliver meaningful value quickly and succeed within your organizational culture?</li>
<li>How do you find the ESM products that will work best for your projects, in your environment?</li>
</ol>
<p>This guide addresses those two issues. It provides an overview of ESM’s value proposition and explains the important market trends to consider as you weigh your ESM options. It steps you through seven key considerations, including executive sponsorship, organizational culture, and process readiness, that will help you find the kinds of projects and products that are most likely to help you deliver a win, given your organization’s current state of ESM maturity. Finally, it offers specific recommendations about what you should ask in your request for proposal (RFP) to ensure that the ESM tool vendors you evaluate will supply the information you need to make a smart decision.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What it is and why it matters</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>ESM has its origins in ITSM, but there are important differences. </p>
<p>Most ITSM tools automate important IT service workflows, processes, and tasks—from putting new servers into operation and managing network users to patching, upgrading, and retiring hardware and software. Employees may <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-ku-transformed-its-health-system-lean-it-service-management" rel="noopener noreferrer">experience traditional ITSM</a> when they go to their company intranet portal to request password resets, access to secure applications, or a new laptop.</p>
<p>Before service automation with ITSM was available, IT teams used shared email boxes and spreadsheets to receive and track such requests. The ESM approach is the same—but for different outcomes. </p>
<h4>The ESM approach</h4>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/8-steps-get-started-enterprise-service-management" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESM applies this same approach</a> to non-IT services. An ESM tool <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-extend-it-service-management-whole-business" rel="noopener noreferrer">goes beyond the IT help desk</a>, allowing any department to provide its own services with similar efficiency. Employees may experience ESM when they use portals and apps to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book business travel</li>
<li>Report faulty window shades</li>
<li>Apply for open jobs</li>
<li>Find their pay stubs</li>
<li>Request time off</li>
</ul>
<p>In organizations without ESM, employees rely on email or the phone to request such things from different departments.</p>
<h4>ESM adoption: Here and growing fast</h4>
<p>Some degree of ESM is already showing up in most enterprises. According to a 2019 Enterprise Management Associates (EMA) study, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/buyers-guide-esm-tools-special-report-tb/automation-ai-and-analytics-reinventing-itsm?utm_source=techbeacon&#038;utm_medium=referral&#038;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automation, AI, and Analytics: Reinventing ITSM,</a>&#8221; 87% of enterprises had some level of ESM deployed to enhance customer and employee satisfaction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another recent EMA study, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/buyers-guide-esm-tools-special-report-tb/enterprise-service-management?utm_source=techbeacon&#038;utm_medium=referral&#038;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enterprise Service Management, It&#8217;s Closer Than You Think</a>,&#8221; found that &#8220;ESM is the natural next step for organizations looking to cut costs while improving end-user service and operational efficiencies.&#8221; The C-suite is <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/5-ways-overcome-practical-political-challenges-esm" rel="noopener noreferrer">leading the charge to adopt ESM</a>, in pursuit of the enormous business benefits it can deliver.</p>
<h4>Which problems does ESM solve?</h4>
<p>By automating different aspects of service delivery and support, your organization can support the needs of customers and employees more consistently, more quickly, and more adaptively. According to the 2019 HDI Trends report, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/assets/it-operations-management/how-ai-is-enabling-enterprise-service-management" rel="noopener noreferrer">How AI Is Enabling Enterprise Service Management</a>,&#8221; the primary driver for ESM adoption is to improve the customer experience. </p>
<p>&#8220;Employee satisfaction increased in 52% of organizations that both measure employee satisfaction and have expanded service management beyond IT,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>ESM addresses many of the problems that come with organizational growth and expansion:</p>
<ul>
<li>It allows employees to handle increasing volumes of work comfortably.</li>
<li>It keeps customer and employee requests from falling through the cracks.</li>
<li>It provides high-quality support at lower costs by using new AI-enabled capabilities like chatbots.</li>
<li>It consolidates multiple manual tools into a single service management platform.</li>
<li>It overcomes the limitations of manual operations, enhancing quality, speed, and scalability.</li>
<li>It breaks down the barriers between siloed services, giving all employees access to the tools and information they need to be productive—particularly important after an acquisition or merger.</li>
<li>It gives customers and employees self-service access to the support, tools, and resources they need, without requiring any human interaction.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Key takeaways</h4>
<ul>
<li>ESM is related to ITSM, but ESM automates tasks for departments outside of IT, including HR, finance, travel, and utilities.</li>
<li>ESM helps cut costs while improving end-user service and operational efficiencies, which is why the C-suite is so interested in adopting it.</li>
<li>After implementation, employee satisfaction and productivity usually improve by allowing employees to handle more work and by giving them self-service access to the information and tools they need to do their jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Types of tools and capabilities</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Enterprises typically start providing services with desktop productivity tools such as shared email boxes, spreadsheets, and shared folders. But the limitations of these tools soon become apparent, especially when they must support time-sensitive manual processes that require consistent, error-free execution 24/7, or when they can&#8217;t generate useful metrics for troubleshooting, monitoring, or optimizing.</p>
<p>The resulting chaos is the root cause of many complaints about slow service, unresponsive service teams, lost requests, and delivery errors. When the business decides that&#8217;s no longer acceptable, it often looks for an ESM tool.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Replacing the email box" data-delta="2" data-fid="12515" data-media-element="1" height="450" src="https://techbeacon.scdn7.secure.raxcdn.com/sites/default/files/esm_buyers_guide_-_mod_2.png" title="Replacing the email box" typeof="Image" width="800"/></p>
<p>&#8220;What the ESM tool is doing is replacing the shared email box. Nothing more complicated than that,&#8221; said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/CharlesTBetz" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Charles Betz</a>, principal analyst at the research firm Forrester. Even a basic ESM tool can overcome problems like emails getting lost, overlooked, or misrouted. &#8220;All ITSM tools could potentially be used for ESM, but only a few can go beyond a standard help desk,&#8221; said <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelpott/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Michael Pott</a>, senior product marketing manager at Micro Focus.</p>
<h4>Key tool capabilities</h4>
<p>Tools are already available that can provide ESM augmented with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrated machine learning</li>
<li>Advanced analytics</li>
<li>Enhanced platform intelligence, which refers to the boost in data-informed decision making provided by the more advanced ESM platforms </li>
<li>AI-enabled capabilities</li>
<li>Predictive technology</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these enhancements can help in different ways to deliver higher levels of service to employees and customers.</p>
<p>Vendors are also beginning to provide more non-IT modules that are designed for the services provided by departments outside of IT. You&#8217;ll find new workflows and portals for HR, finance, legal, facilities, and many other functions.</p>
<h4>What ESM platforms offer</h4>
<p>A few ESM platforms have emerged to support this growing diversity, and, not surprisingly, they are tightly integrated with all of the individual ESM products offered by each platform vendor. But these platforms also allow you to plug in the ESM tools you may already own, and they interoperate nicely with the ESM products offered by most other vendors.</p>
<p>(To get acquainted with the top ESM vendors, review<a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/buyers-guide-esm-tools-special-report-tb/forrester-wave-esm-q419?utm_source=techbeacon&#038;utm_medium=referral&#038;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Forrester Wave: Enterprise Service Management, Q4 2019</a>. Forrester analysts used 23 criteria to assess the top 15 ESM providers, and this will help you understand the kinds of offerings available to you.)</p>
<h4>Buying strategies</h4>
<p>When evaluating products, you need to think about how a given product fits in with the direction of the overall market, as well as how it aligns with your plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at where you are today, think about where you want to be a year from now, and start to buy forward, but not too far forward,&#8221; said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/JayneGroll" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jayne Groll</a>, CEO of the DevOps Institute. The ESM marketplace is &#8220;moving very quickly, and it&#8217;s hard to predict who will be buying who, and what that might imply for your investment,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Two-year planning makes the best sense from both a cost and support perspective.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also smart to buy tools that will work in your current environment, not things that only support your long-range plans. &#8220;If you&#8217;re not in the cloud now and don&#8217;t have plans to move there any time soon, don&#8217;t buy something designed for the cloud just because you hope to get there in five years,&#8221; advised Groll.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s far better to buy something that will deliver a win for you today and help you get into the cloud tomorrow.</p>
<h4>Key takeaways</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tools are already available that can provide ESM augmented with integrated machine learning, advanced analytics, enhanced platform intelligence, AI-enabled capabilities, and predictive technology.</li>
<li>Vendors are increasingly providing department-specific ESM tools, for human resources or finance, for example.</li>
<li>Make sure any platforms you&#8217;re considering platforms allow you to plug in the ESM tools you may already own and interoperate with as many other tools as possible.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t get too far ahead of yourself; think in terms of a two-year planning cycle and ensure tools can handle what you already are doing, not what may happen five years from now.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Top 5 ESM technology and market trends</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>When evaluating ESM platforms, think about how a given product fits in with the direction of the overall market, as well as how it aligns with your plans. The vendor landscape has solidified, and the market is competing vigorously for your business.</p>
<p>Here are the top five technology and market trends in Enterprise Service Management (ESM), and recommendations from experts on how to make smart buying decisions and equip your teams with the skills they&#8217;ll need in the future. </p>
<p><strong>1. AI, automation, and machine learning technologies are advancing rapidly</strong></p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for 50 years, but actual business adoption is fairly new. <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/buyers-guide-esm-tools-special-report-tb/automation-ai-and-analytics-reinventing-itsm?utm_source=techbeacon&#038;utm_medium=referral&#038;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESM vendors have been adding elements of AI,</a> automation, and machine learning to their offerings. &#8220;AI plus automation is a logical equation,&#8221; said <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennisdrogseth/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dennis Drogseth</a>, vice president of Enterprise Management Associates (EMA). &#8220;AI gives you insight, and automation gives you action. Action without insight equals train wrecks. Insight without action doesn’t help you very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>As much as people would like to embrace the benefits of AI and automation, the fierce competition and pace of development in this area can be paralyzing. While there are many different kinds of AI and automation, it will eventually come together as &#8220;a new landscape, not a single direction,&#8221; Drogseth said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Insight plus action" data-delta="1" data-fid="12516" data-media-element="1" height="450" src="https://techbeacon.scdn7.secure.raxcdn.com/sites/default/files/esm_buyers_guide_-_mod_3_.png" title="Insight plus action" typeof="Image" width="800"/></p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to get started now, even though the landscape is still developing. &#8220;I tell my clients, the sooner you jump in the pool and start swimming, the sooner you&#8217;ll be able to take advantage of it,&#8221; said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/dougtedder" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Doug Tedder</a>, principal of Tedder Consulting. Your team will gain experience, your organization will start to reap benefits, and you will be ready to use the innovations when they hit the street.</p>
<p><strong>2. AIOps is bringing service management under a single pane of glass</strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/top-10-predictions-ai-it-operations" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artificial intelligence for IT operations</a> (AIOps) technology is changing the service management game by allowing you to control all your service management capabilities under a single pane of glass. &#8220;We&#8217;ve talked about it for years, but it&#8217;s finally here,&#8221; said Tedder. &#8220;AIOps platforms let you bring together all of your network monitoring, operations monitoring, and application portfolio monitoring, do some correlation, and visualize it together,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In service management, the big advantage this gives you is faster insight, which leads to improved quality. You can focus your efforts on the most important things that are happening, &#8220;and when something goes wrong you can hit pause much quicker,&#8221; said Tedder.</p>
<p><strong>3. ESM is integrating with DevOps</strong></p>
<p>The top ESM platforms are designed for maximum interoperability, including most enterprise DevOps tools. This is crucial for long-term success. &#8220;You must be able to integrate ESM with the application development lifecycle,&#8221; said Pott. This will let you use the principles from ITSM to manage a variety of services, confident that all of the technology underpinnings—your ESM and DevOps tools— will work harmoniously together.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you’re doing in DevOps needs to fit in with service management, at the end of the day,&#8221; said Tedder. &#8220;Service management ensures you&#8217;re delivering value. And<a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/devops-how-deliver-services-not-just-products" rel="noopener noreferrer"> DevOps is actually about delivering a complete value stream.</a>&#8221; </p>
<p>Tedder finds that many people still think that DevOps is somehow separate from ESM or ITSM. “I can’t say this strongly enough: DevOps is ITSM. It’s just a different approach—but there’s no philosophical, technical, or conceptual reason why DevOps and ITSM can’t get along,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>4. ESM will manage services pre-cloud and in the cloud</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The cloud will be a huge influence on the future direction of ESM development,&#8221; said Groll. &#8220;After all, you already need to manage and deliver services pre-cloud as well as in private, public, and hybrid clouds. ESM vendors are working to make that easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many ESM apps are cloud-native—built specifically for the cloud—but your organization will probably use them along with other kinds of apps already in place in your environment, including on the mainframe.</p>
<p>All of that affects how you&#8217;ll manage services now and in the future. &#8220;You&#8217;ll need specific skills to get the proper relationship with the cloud, and you&#8217;ll need an ESM platform that enables your team to be successful,&#8221; Groll said.</p>
<p><strong>5. Expect to see more vertical-specific integrations</strong></p>
<p>EMA&#8217;s Drogseth expects platform evolution to include vertical-specific integrations that move beyond reporting. Vendors are moving toward intelligent ESM platforms with good analytics, service modeling, and a core platform specialized for use in specific verticals. &#8220;This movement is already underway, and is not very far off,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h4>Key takeaways</h4>
<p>These are the five most important trends to consider for your ESM tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI, automation, and machine learning technologies are advancing rapidly</li>
<li>AIOps is pulling service management for all your systems into one platform</li>

<h3>7 key questions to ask</h3>
<p>When ESM consultants first get started with a new enterprise client, they walk through several foundational considerations before they discuss products or issue a request for proposal (RFP). This helps the consultants determine the scope of the project, the readiness of the organization, and the strategy that will deliver a win.</p>
<p>The process is also highly instructive for the client, or should be, as it often reveals serious issues they will need to address before any implementation begins.</p>
<p>Here are seven questions you should consider before beginning your search for an ESM vendor.</p>
<p><strong>1. What is your current state?</strong></p>
<p>What do you already have that you will need to integrate with your new ESM system? Interoperability is the key to a successful implementation, so take an inventory of all of apps and tools that will be involved. This will become part of your RFP.</p>
<p><strong>2. Where are you in the service management maturity curve?</strong></p>
<p>Organizations fall into three general levels of service management maturity, according to    Drogseth. Projects that match your maturity level have the best chance for success.</p>
<p><strong><em>Level 1: You&#8217;re just getting started</em></strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re new to ESM, start with a basic non-IT workflow that will support multiple stakeholders. This will give you a measurable improvement over the manual processes currently in place, and your team gains valuable experience that will prepare them for more advanced projects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Level 2: You have basic service management in a few areas of the organization</em></strong></p>
<p>If you already have a few successful ESM implementations under your belt, you are ready to get more involved with process automation. Get into a &#8220;service-centric mindset, think services, and define services. Then look for a tool to support this, with service modeling integrations,&#8221; said Pott. </p>
<p>You might be thinking about <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/key-chatbot-success-high-quality-conversations" rel="noopener noreferrer">adding chatbots</a>—a popular first AI project. But be aware that chatbot implementations require a surprising amount of upfront preparation. &#8220;Chatbots can&#8217;t work without databases full of current knowledge and well-documented business processes,&#8221; said Pott.</p>
<p>&#8220;This can be very discouraging to the new user, who thinks that the automation tool will do most of the work and all they have to do is install it,&#8221; said Tedder. &#8220;Many organizations simply can&#8217;t adopt AI technology because they are not already managing knowledge.&#8221; </p>
<p>You must first define a function or process in a way that is repeatable, to make it something that AI can execute. &#8220;If you haven&#8217;t already defined services in terms of business outcomes, then how can you program predictive tech to make the right choice when faced with a set of circumstances?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>If your organization isn&#8217;t quite ready for chatbots, Tedder suggests starting with a smaller AI project that takes weeks, rather than months, to implement. Show a small incremental value, and continue to build on that in successive projects. In a couple of years, you will have everything in place that you wanted.</p>
<p><strong><em>Level 3: You already have highly advanced ESM in place</em></strong></p>
<p>If you are well underway with ESM, consider adding new capabilities and advanced technologies such as:</p>
<p>Companies with a well-established ESM culture are prepared to use AI capabilities for quite a few things, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/msitsm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Phyllis Drucker</a>, senior consultant at Linium. &#8220;If you have lots of current data at hand already,&#8221; she said, &#8220;upgrading to a tool with AI, machine learning, or predictive analytics is a great next step&#8221; for projects such as:</p>
<p><strong>3. What are your priorities and project goals?</strong></p>
<p>What is your scope? Your intent? How do you envision service management in your organization? These are the big questions you need to answer before looking for a tool, according to Forrester&#8217;s Betz. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Why ESM fails" data-delta="1" data-fid="12517" data-media-element="1" height="450" src="https://techbeacon.scdn7.secure.raxcdn.com/sites/default/files/_esm_buyers_guide_-_mod_4.png" title="Why ESM fails" typeof="Image" width="800"/></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this may be one of the hardest areas to reach agreement on. According to Linium&#8217;s Drucker, one of the most common reasons <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-esm-fails-7-sure-fire-ways-kill-your-project" rel="noopener noreferrer">why ESM initiatives fail </a>is an inability to come to agreement on the objectives. Here are the warning signs that your ESM initiative is headed for disaster:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inability to <strong>agree on the basics</strong>: how the technology is to be used and the desired outcome for the effort.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis paralysis</strong>: people getting too deep in the weeds to see the big picture.</li>
<li>Inability to make a <strong>final decision on requirements</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These problems aren&#8217;t unique to ESM initiatives—they can crop up in different kinds of projects across the entire organization. But they are greatly intensified in automation projects, when people can&#8217;t even agree on what they want the automation to do or which processes should be automated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine trying to use automation to add a record to the configuration management database automatically when there&#8217;s no governance documenting how an item can and should be added,&#8221; said Drucker.</p>
<p>The best way to solve this problem is to have the right sponsor and core team for the project. They can use their organizational authority and domain expertise to drive decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>4. What do you really need?</strong></p>
<p>Before you start shopping, see what tools you might already have in the organization. Teams are not always aware of the products others are using.</p>
<p>EMA&#8217;s Drogseth advised against automatically reaching for the tools that come out on top in analyst reports. &#8220;Those reports can help you understand the different options, but you need to consider your priorities and requirements, and choose a tool that has what you actually need,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Think about things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific functionality</li>
<li>Ease of deployment</li>
<li>Integration readiness</li>
<li>Integration with service-modeling capabilities</li>
<li>Stakeholders you will need to support</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Do you have organizational or cultural factors that could inhibit success?</strong></p>
<p>Departments outside of IT may be resistant to ESM because they do not understand what the technology can do and how they might benefit. Betz has identified two common misperceptions about ESM in non-IT departments:</p>
<p><strong>ESM is really just another name for ITSM.</strong> It is owned and governed by IT, so our department&#8217;s requirements will not be properly understood.</p>
<p>To address this misperception, help stakeholders understand that ESM does not belong to IT. Instead, it is the extension of ITSM principles into more general workloads—solving business problems—rather than managing networks, servers, and password changes.</p>
<p><strong>ESM automations and robotics will ultimately replace the teams that provide services today.</strong></p>
<p>This fear is rooted in a generalized dread of automation, machine learning, and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/will-ai-take-your-it-operations-job" rel="noopener noreferrer">robotics as eventual replacements for human beings</a> in the workforce.</p>
<p>To address this fear, help stakeholders understand that an ESM tool does not provide service. It is simply a unified capture point for people&#8217;s requests, which can route those requests to the people who can take action on them. ESM won&#8217;t replace a business user&#8217;s core systems; it simply replaces the shared mailbox where those requests are sent.</p>
<p>&#8220;The proper organizational culture is a vital component of success,&#8221; EMA&#8217;s Drogseth said. Where the people providing services are not focused solely on service desk activities, but are aligned with business outcomes and business performance, they tend to be much more progressive about ESM. They are more willing to leverage analytics, and unafraid to &#8220;let automation drive an entire process, rather than requiring six levels of approval,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This kind of culture &#8220;ultimately starts in the executive suite—usually with the CIO—who defines how people will share data and work together, and determines how flexible people can be, rather than how siloed,&#8221; said Drogseth.</p>
<p>If you have this kind of culture already, you are well-positioned for success. <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/5-ways-overcome-practical-political-challenges-esm" rel="noopener noreferrer">If you have a less progressive culture</a>, you will need the help of the right sponsor or your project will fail.</p>
<p><strong>6. Who is your sponsor, and how actively will they support ESM?</strong></p>
<p>The number one cause of poor experiences with ESM is a poor adoption strategy, followed by a lack of communication before and throughout the effort, and a lack of backing for the project, according to Linium&#8217;s Drucker. The project&#8217;s core team is responsible for developing a solid adoption strategy and proper communication plan. But from the outset, that core team must have the right kind of sponsor who can supply active, visionary, executive-level support for the long haul.</p>
<p>Without the right level of sponsorship, you won’t have cooperation across the different areas of the business. Consultant Tedder said that in small- to mid-size companies, CEOs are the best ESM project sponsors. For global enterprises, the CIO and CMO often jointly sponsor such projects. &#8220;This seems to be a naturally evolving partnership that works well,&#8221; said Tedder.</p>
<p>You need the C-Suite backing you up because they&#8217;re the ones responsible for overall business performance. The right sponsor has the power to act decisively as well as to resolve any conflicts and cultural issues. They&#8217;ll make sure that ESM becomes a long-term effort that continues to add value to the business.</p>
<p><strong>7. Can you build the right kind of team?</strong></p>
<p>To succeed, you need a mix of executive leadership, process and political alignment, and strong mid-level management teams—architects, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/sre-practice-5-insights-googles-experience" rel="noopener noreferrer">site reliability engineers</a> (SREs), and DevOps and analytics specialists. &#8220;You need a truly strategic initiative, with a team defined to own that strategy,&#8221; said EMA&#8217;s Drogseth. &#8220;They will get direction, leadership, and air cover from the executive sponsor, but the day-to-day work will fall to them.&#8221; In some places, they call this the automation center of excellence.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/VesnaSoraic" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Vesna Soraic</a>, senior product marketing manager at Micro Focus, said that ESM presents an organizational change and management opportunity that is vital to long-term success. In her opinion, ESM must be supported by a cross-functional team that is engaged for the long haul.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be sure IT has a seat at the table. Since IT has the most experience with automated service processes, they should participate as a trusted advisor on the team. All other departments in the enterprise need IT&#8217;s help to get more advanced in this area,&#8221; said Soraic.</p>
<p>The team must be willing to take a staged approach to implementation that can evolve based on priorities, according to EMA&#8217;s Drogseth. And they must be prepared for a long, sustained effort that does not result in a project launch with a single before-and-after state, but rather multiple projects that create a stepladder to where you&#8217;re trying to go.</p>
<h4>Build a list of viable options</h4>
<p>Once you have worked through these questions, you should have a good idea what kind of project your organization is ready to tackle, and, within a few months, have found one that can deliver measurable business value.</p>
<p>Now you are ready to look for tools that will support that project. Use these five key selection criteria to find products and vendors that fit your requirements, and build a list of products to evaluate.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>5 key selection criteria</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Here are five selection criteria consultants and other experts consider to be most important when evaluating ESM products.</p>
<p><strong>1. Does it have the most important core features?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;To be in <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/buyers-guide-esm-tools-special-report-tb/forrester-wave-esm-q419?lx=HU1h77&#038;?utm_source=techbeacon&#038;utm_medium=referral&#038;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Forrester Wave</a> they have to have all these things,&#8221; said Forrester&#8217;s Betz. In his opinion, you should not seriously consider options that don&#8217;t have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic workflow engine</li>
<li>Configuration management database asset registry</li>
<li>Incident and change management</li>
<li>General request management</li>
<li>Service portal</li>
<li>Modules that fit your requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>For detailed recommendations about how to map ESM vendors to your priorities and requirements, check out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forrester.com/report/Forresters+Enterprise+Service+Management+ESM+Buying+Guide+2020/-/E-RES159097" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Forrester&#8217;s Enterprise Service Management (ESM) Buying Guide, 2020.</a></p>
<p><strong>2. Was it designed to do what I need it to do?</strong></p>
<p>The tool you purchase should be built for the types of use cases you have. A tool that wasn&#8217;t designed for your use cases isn’t a good match, no matter how well it&#8217;s rated in other areas.</p>
<p>Forrester&#8217;s Betz said that sometimes people are disappointed with an industry-leading tool that was recommended in the <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/buyers-guide-esm-tools-special-report-tb/forrester-wave-esm-q419?lx=HU1h77&#038;?utm_source=techbeacon&#038;utm_medium=referral&#038;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forrester Wave</a>, and they complain to the research firm. &#8220;After a short discussion, 90% of the time the customer will admit that they tried to get the tool to do something that it wasn’t designed to do,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They say, &#8216;Well, our consultant told us not to do it, a field engineer told us not to do it, but we had to customize the tool in a certain way to fit our business process. And it just didn’t work!'&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the biggest mistake you can make with ESM technology, according to Betz, because non-standard processes fly in the face of the industry best practices that are built into the tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of the products in the Wave are battle-hardened and have had to deliver very high-visibility workloads in production, sometimes for decades,&#8221; he said. The designers of these tools study hundreds of successful processes and design everything around processes that have business consensus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless you have tons of value riding on that nonstandard process, and it&#8217;s a competitive differentiator, you should fix your business process to work the way the tool is designed,&#8221; said Betz.</p>
<p><strong>3. Will it interoperate easily with my existing environment?</strong></p>
<p>Interoperability is the most important selection criteria when choosing among vendor offerings that have all the basic features you need. In general, look for vendors that use web services and open APIs that make it easy for different tools to share data.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll want to integrate ESM with your DevOps toolchain and all your existing ITSM and ESM tools. Some vendors offer a pre-published set of APIs for the most popular platforms. At a minimum, you want an integration guide. (For specific guidance on how to ask about interoperability, see How to create your RFP.)</p>
<p><strong>4. Which vendors fit the scope of my operations?</strong></p>
<p>Scope of operations is one of the biggest differentiators among products, according to Forrester&#8217;s Betz. Look for tools that fit the size of your organization and that can support the scale of workloads for which you expect to use them. For guidance about how to consider requirements based on organization size, take a look at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forrester.com/report/Forresters+Enterprise+Service+Management+ESM+Buying+Guide+2020/-/E-RES159097" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Forrester&#8217;s Enterprise Service Management (ESM) Buying Guide, 2020</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5. What else can the vendor do?</strong></p>
<p>Think about the vendor&#8217;s offerings holistically. &#8220;This is a significant and very valid point of comparison when deciding on a vendor,&#8221; said Betz. For example, you might find a tool that is in the middle of the pack in the Forrester Wave for ESM, but it has a strong endpoint management capability. &#8220;If you need device management as well as service management, they&#8221;d be a better choice for you than others who may have scored better on pure ESM capabilities,” said Betz.</p>
<h4>Key takeaways</h4>
<ul>
<li>Take the time, before you start to seriously consider specific products, to step through the seven questions above to help determine the scope of the project, the readiness of your organization, and the strategy that will deliver a win.</li>
<li>Another important benefit of this approach: It often reveals serious issues that you will need to address before implementation begins.</li>
<li>Make sure you have the correct sponsor and right team, and honestly assess your ESM maturity level. Cultural issues are key to success.</li>
<li>Remember that the tools you already have will need to integrate with whatever new ones you consider. Also consider ease of deployment. </li>
<li>Keep in mind our five important selection criteria: Core features, and make sure you understand the use cases a tool was designed to help. Force-fitting that tool into a situation it wasn&#8217;t designed for can just about guarantee a failure.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>How to create your RFP</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>After determining your project scope and requirements, use this guide to create a request for proposal (RFP) to send to the vendors on your list.</p>
<p>Here we&#8217;ve compiled a list of questions that you might want to include in your RFP. Use this list as a guide and trim away the pieces you don&#8217;t need. Try to limit your product-related questions to those that are critical to your organization and keep it short, but complete. </p>
<p>The reason: When you send lengthy lists of product requirements to vendors, you&#8217;ll get back lengthy responses that are virtually impossible to compare. Focus on your top 10 requirements, and you will find it much easier to contrast vendors and make an informed decision.</p>
<p>When evaluating the vendor responses, consider assigning weightings to the requirements to ensure that your most important requirements are ranked highest as you score the candidates.</p>
<h4>Introduce yourself—provide a statement of your current status</h4>
<p><strong>Statement of goals, concerns, and objectives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Describe your service management automation goals, the problems you are trying to solve, and any relevant metrics you are hoping to improve.</li>
<li>State the greatest concerns for company management relative to service management, customer satisfaction, digital transformation, and business efficiency, and explain how you expect this tool to contribute.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Describe your interoperability requirements in detail</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>List the tools you have, and note your preference for a tool with the specific APIs you need for things like configuration, infrastructure, and monitoring. Ask vendors to comment about interoperability in those three areas.</li>
<li>Ask how much effort it will take to integrate their product with your toolset using their APIs/openAPI.</li>
<li>Provide an inventory of the kind of data (often bi-directional) you need to support, and ask them to explain in detail what their product can do in those areas.</li>
<li>Ask how their tools interoperate with cloud-native apps.</li>
<li>Ask how their tools capture information from the cloud.</li>
<li>Ask how easy it is to switch between cloud-based and on-premises services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Request specific details about ease of use</strong></p>
<p>Today&#8217;s ESM buyers are looking for products that are less complicated to implement, upgrade, license, and maintain, particularly in light of the many integrations needed to make enterprise services flow properly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask how much effort is required to implement and maintain their product.</li>
<li>Ask how much effort is needed to upgrade to a new version, including all of the integrations that have been implemented.</li>
<li>Ask them to describe their approach to licensing and license management.</li>
<li>If you are having problems with the products you already own, describe how they are falling short—how they create too much work for your team or what capabilities they lack—and explain what you expect a new solution to provide.</li>
<li>Be transparent about what you don&#8217;t have and why you think it will help you to have it. Vendors and service providers can be valuable partners, so be frank about the issues you face with your current tools. They may surprise you with fresh ideas and strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement of resources</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Explain the job titles and skillsets of the people who will use the tool.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Infrastructure requirements</strong></p>
<p>List the main elements of your environment that are relevant to the tool usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating systems</li>
<li>Hardware</li>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>DevOps frameworks/pipeline</li>
<li>Cloud strategy</li>
</ul>
<h4>Vendor information</h4>
<p>Here are sample questions to ask the vendors. Our list covers a lot of ground, but you probably won&#8217;t need to ask all of them in your RFP. If you don’t have a mainframe, for example, there’s no need to ask about that. Trim this list as required to meet your needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your company, history, and ITSM/ESM focus?</li>
<li>Who is the primary contact for sales? Who is the primary contact for technical questions?</li>
<li>Do you have reference customers that can be contacted?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Products and capabilities</strong></p>
<p>This section helps you understand the product, the vendor&#8217;s approach to service management, and any innovations the vendor offers.</p>
<ul>
<li>List your product or products and the primary category of each.</li>
<li>List the scope of operations the tool was designed for.</li>
<li>What kinds of skills are required to use this tool?</li>
<li>What browsers do you support?</li>
<li>What devices do you support?</li>
<li>What platforms do you support?</li>
<li>Can your product handle services that are provided by mainframe apps?</li>
<li>Which continuous integration/continuous delivery tools do you support?</li>
<li>How easy is it to integrate your product with the other tools I currently use?</li>
<li>How easy is it to extend your product?</li>
<li>What types of reporting and analytics capabilities does the product provide? Is integration with a third-party reporting tool required for minimum reporting?</li>
<li>What are the features or innovations that differentiate you from your competitors?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deployment, updates, and support</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is your product or service offered on-premises, as a cloud service, or as a hybrid solution?</li>
<li>Does deployment require a consulting engagement?</li>
<li>Do you offer guided consulting to assist during implementation?</li>
<li>How often do you release new versions or update the software?</li>
<li>Do you offer support? What are the terms of your support contracts?</li>
<li>What training options do you offer?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h4>Next steps</h4>
<p>There has never been a better time to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/8-steps-get-started-enterprise-service-management" rel="noopener noreferrer">get started with ESM</a>, or to expand your ESM footprint. The vendor market has solidified, the benefits are increasingly obvious, and the tools are getting easier to use. Most importantly, some of your competitors are probably already using ESM in some areas and will continue to exploit that competitive edge over you until you enter the game.</p>
<p>Done right, ESM can become the platform for your organization’s back-office digital transformation. Back-office operations are often overlooked in the drive to achieve digital transformation. But when companies fail to address the operational side, they haven’t really transformed the business.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="The importance of operations" data-delta="1" data-fid="12518" data-media-element="1" height="450" src="https://techbeacon.scdn7.secure.raxcdn.com/sites/default/files/_esm_buyers_guide_-_mod_5.png" title="The importance of operations" typeof="Image" width="800"/></p>
<p>As a 2019 World Economic Forum paper said: &#8220;Customer engagement is essential, great product and services are mandatory, and an innovative economic model may be table stakes, but without operations all of that fails.&#8221; In some cases, &#8220;Back-office actually becomes front-office, as non-IT departments expose their services to their employees and customers, which in turn, requires them to become service-centric organizations,&#8221; said Pott.</p>
<p>Get started today. Using the information and guidance in this document, assemble a team with the right players, step with them through the fundamental considerations, and get a viable ESM project underway. With the right sponsor, team, and ESM technologies in place, you&#8217;ll embark on a journey of continuous improvement that will keep your organization competitive and add value to the entire business for many years to come.</p>
<h4>Key takeaways</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to limit your product-related questions to those that are critical to your organization and keep it short. When you send lengthy lists of product requirements to vendors, you&#8217;ll get back lengthy responses that are virtually impossible to compare.</li>
<li>In the RFP, include your goals, concerns, and objectives.</li>
<li>Spell out your interoperability requirements in detail; include your current tools and an inventory of the data you need to support.</li>
<li>Get information about maintenance and support, as well as license requirements.</li>
<li>Find out about the vendor; ask about company history, primary sales/support contacts, and customer references.</li>
<li>Get details about the product&#8217;s features, functions, scope, platforms supported, and how easy or difficult it would be to extend or customize.</li>
<li>Get going! Done correctly, ESM can become the platform for your organization&#8217;s back-office digital transformation.</li>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The cybersecurity battle is being lost on almost every front. In addition to the usual battery of threats aimed at organizations, automated, multi-phased attacks are becoming more common, and organizations are on their heels.</p>
<p>The good news is that hope is not lost. Many consider one of science fiction&#8217;s oldest tropes—artificial intelligence—to be their greatest hope for shifting the balance of power.</p>
<p>A recent study by Capgemini Research Institute, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.capgemini.com/research/reinventing-cybersecurity-with-artificial-intelligence/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Reinventing Cybersecurity with Artificial Intelligence: The New Frontier in Digital Security</a>,&#8221; said that before 2019, only about 20% of cybersecurity organizations used AI in their technology stacks. But the report concluded that &#8220;adoption is poised to skyrocket,&#8221; with 63% of organizations planning AI deployments by the end of 2020.</p>
<p>That shouldn&#8217;t be surprising. Companies are seeing an unprecedented explosion in the volume and sophistication of cyber attacks, and there are no signs of the situation abating any time soon.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/5-key-elements-next-gen-security-operations-center" rel="noopener noreferrer">Security operation centers</a> (SOCs) are overwhelmed by a fusillade of alerts. Threat actors are increasingly using automation to attack more quickly and effectively. At the same time, security teams are finding themselves with not enough personnel and with some staffers who are under-skilled.</p>
<p>The tedium of investigating and responding to this parade of known and unknown threats, along with the daunting odds of effectively containing them, is putting analysts at risk of burnout.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that SOCs are turning to AI for relief.</p>
<p>Empowering the SOC with AI-enabled tools is proving essential to turning the tide on cyber crime. It reduces the amount of time <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/ai-changing-secops-what-security-analysts-need-know" rel="noopener noreferrer">analysts have to spend on repetitive, time-consuming tasks</a>, so they can dive deeper into threat analysis and response. AI allows attacks to be identified and resolved more quickly, minimizing their impact and cost for the organization. And it positions analysts to work smarter rather than harder, providing a much-needed boost to productivity and morale.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s important to understand that AI is not one technology but many. The transformation of the SOC is being driven mainly by one AI subset: <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/state-machine-learning-soc-how-leverage-data-deluge" rel="noopener noreferrer">machine learning</a>. This form of AI automatically learns from data to make predictions, draw inferences, and discover patterns. This makes it uniquely suited to leverage the colossal amounts of security data that enterprises produce.</p>
<p>But <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/ai-cybersecurity-3-things-your-team-needs-know" rel="noopener noreferrer">bringing AI into the SOC</a> is not as straightforward as procuring a tool set and waiting for the magic to happen. It requires careful consideration of your organization&#8217;s business needs, your SOC&#8217;s skill set, and the outcomes you hope to achieve.</p>
<p>Failure to adequately prepare will likely have dire consequences. Gartner predicts that through 2022, some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2018-02-13-gartner-says-nearly-half-of-cios-are-planning-to-deploy-artificial-intelligence" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">85% of AI projects will fail</a> due to incorrect or mismanaged implementations.</p>
<p>In the following sections, you&#8217;ll learn how AI is transforming the SOC. First up: Why AI and advanced analytics-specific tools are critical given the changing tech landscape. Next, you&#8217;ll read about the key trends in AI and how AI is being applied to security and SOC teams. Lastly, you&#8217;ll learn about the criteria for considering AI-powered tools for your SOC.</p>
<h3><a target="_blank" name="matters" rel="noopener noreferrer"></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>AI in the SOC: What it is and why it matters</h3>
<p>When we consider everything the SOC is tasked with doing, the critical role AI can play within it becomes clearer. Broadly speaking, the SOC is responsible for centralizing security information for the entire organization, monitoring events in real time, and responding to security incidents. Any of these responsibilities can benefit from using AI.</p>
<p>But despite the hype surrounding AI in the enterprise, there is still a considerable amount of confusion about exactly what AI is and what its capabilities are. A bedrock understanding of AI is essential for determining how it can fit into your security operations and what results you can expect if you implement it.</p>
<p>AI can be best understood as an umbrella term that describes machines that are engineered to replicate a human&#8217;s natural intelligence. Humans can speak and hear, read and write, move through our physical environment, perceive input from the world around us, convert that input into knowledge, and problem-solve.</p>
<p>AI analogs exist for each of these human behaviors. Natural-language processing, for example, helps computers understand and interpret human languages. Computer vision helps them see and process visual information. Pattern recognition allows them to identify groups of similar objects.</p>
<h4>Machine learning is key</h4>
<p>Machine learning (ML) is perhaps the most popular and widely implemented field of AI. At its most basic, ML uses algorithms to autonomously process massive amounts of data, learn from it, make predictions or determinations based on what it has learned, and improve its performance over time.</p>
<p>When used for security purposes, ML is generally classified as one of two types—supervised and unsupervised—each uniquely suited to particular use cases.</p>
<p>In <strong>the supervised model</strong>, an algorithm is guided using a dataset that includes examples with specific outcomes for each one. The algorithm is told what variables to analyze and is given feedback on the accuracy of its predictions. In this way, the algorithm is &#8220;trained&#8221; using existing data to predict the outcome of new data.</p>
<p>Conversely, <strong>unsupervised ML</strong> explores data without reference to known outcomes. It&#8217;s best used to identify previously unknown patterns in unstructured data and group them according to their similarities.</p>
<h4>The tooling landscape</h4>
<p>Security tools have become increasingly sophisticated to keep up with the rising tide of advanced cyber attacks. <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/units/how-choose-siem-suite" rel="noopener noreferrer">Security information and event management (SIEM) tools</a> remain foundational for SOCs, providing a centralized way to identify, monitor, analyze, and record security incidents in real time. These tools aggregate, normalize, and apply analytics to security data from across the organization to discover security incidents and alert the SOC team to them.</p>
<p>However, SIEMs’ inability to detect manually instigated attacks and their reactive, alert-based approach makes them inadequate on their own. To shore up their defenses, SOCs often integrate their SIEMs with other, more specialized tools.</p>
<p>Security orchestration automation response (SOAR) is often a first step. Tools in this category can automate critical security processes such as investigating phishing messages, managing cloud security, and detecting compromised user accounts. Other tools address endpoint detection and response, network detection and response, vulnerability management, and threat intelligence.</p>
<p>These tools vary from centralized investigation platforms that are used by the whole team to specific tools that an analyst may use just within his or her investigation workflow. Tools may also include tasks such as threat intelligence that can be consumed as external services, said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/fsmontenegro" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Fernando Montenegro</a>, principal analyst for information security at 451 Research, now part of S&#038;P Global Market Intelligence.</p>
<p>Successfully integrated, these tools limit blind spots and improve coverage of the organization’s attack surface.</p>
<p>Of course, the best tools are useless if not applied correctly. Businesses must make sure they have the knowledge, resources, and strategy to combine these tools into a sophisticated SOC.</p>
<p>The modern SOC has three phases—visibility, management, and response—said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/codycornell" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cody Cornell</a>, co-founder and CEO of SOAR provider Swimlane. To have visibility, you need to have telemetry from the on-premises and cloud system, network, and users to see what is happening in the environment. &#8220;This is generally a combination of monitoring data that is aggregated into some log management system that has a strong search capability,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Once you have strong visibility into your systems, you need to be able to manage both the information from your monitoring system and external information such as intelligence and notifications from various sources—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.it-isac.org" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the Information Sharing and Analysis Center</a>, government sources, partners, and vendors.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is no consistent and iterative management system for information you are always going to be searching for the things you need, and it causes considerable context switching, which is inefficient,&#8221; Cornell said.</p>
<p>Finally, once you have visibility and you&#8217;re managing internal and external information well, &#8220;you need to be able to take action on it,&#8221; he said. Your response can take many paths—including remediation, recovery, mitigation, and investigation. The tools to help you take action can be the same tools that you use for visibility, &#8220;if you selected tools that have the right features and you make those features available via APIs to be better centrally instrumented,&#8221; Cornell said.</p>
<h4>Other ways AI can help the SOC</h4>
<p>SOC face multiple challenges. Some <a target="_blank" href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2567647/2019%20ESG%20eBook%20-%20Industry%20Trends%20in%20the%20Era%20of%20Cloud%20Computing%20-%20Chronicle%20-%20October%202019.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">63% of organizations</a> say that conducting cybersecurity analytics and operations in general is more difficult today than it was two years ago, according to a recent Enterprise Strategy Group survey. Organizations cite as contributing factors the rapidly evolving threat landscape, the increasing volume of cybersecurity telemetry data, and the increasing volume of alerts.</p>
<p>Most security operations try to address these problems manually, by throwing people at the tidal wave of alerts and hoping they are skilled enough to do a good job, said <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-triolo-546438/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Chris Triolo</a>, vice president of customer success at security vendor Respond Software.</p>
<p>But there are several factors that make this a less-than-ideal strategy. These include:</p>
<p><strong>Staff shortages</strong></p>
<p>The dearth of human capital in the SOC is a crisis. Each year, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.govtech.com/data/Boosting-the-Cyberworkforce.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">40,000 US cybersecurity jobs</a> go unfilled because the demand exceeds the pool of qualified talent, according to government data. That leaves too few people to keep up with the battery of alerts and attacks that the average SOC faces daily.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an attacker, all I need to do is find one way in, and I&#8217;m in,&#8221; said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/mariodaigle" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mario Daigle</a>, vice president of products at Interset, a provider of security-analytics solutions now owned by Micro Focus (<em>TechBeacon</em>&#8216;s corporate parent). &#8220;As a defender, I have to block every possible point of entry—which I would argue is impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a result, the deck is &#8220;completely stacked against the good guys,&#8221; Daigle said. Without the ability to use AI, you don&#8217;t have enough humans to find these threats and exploits. &#8220;It&#8217;s guaranteed someone is going to find a way in. When they do, your only hope is having machines help your humans be more efficient; otherwise you&#8217;re not going to find them.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Repetitive tasks</strong></p>
<p>People are good at cognitive tasks, but not at repetitive, high-volume activities—&#8221;and there are a lot of the latter in the SOC,&#8221; Respond Software&#8217;s Triolo said. Machines, on the other hand, excel at these activities.</p>
<p>Using AI and ML to analyze and triage security data provides more depth and consistency than even the best human analysis can match. Relieving SOC team members of this mundane activity, Triolo said, frees them to focus on hunting for real attacks and chasing down the attackers. It&#8217;s more engaging work that can go a long way toward preventing the burnout issues most SOC teams grapple with.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of technological expertise</strong></p>
<p>Like many other organizations nowadays, &#8220;there is a severe resource constraint at the same time that there is an almost <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Cambrian-explosion" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cambrian explosion</a> in the technologies that are being used&#8221; in the SOC, said 451 Research&#8217;s Montenegro.</p>
<p>Indeed, more than half of respondents in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3210486/cybersecurity-skills-shortage-profound-impact-on-security-analytics-and-operations.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">another ESG study</a> said their organizations don&#8217;t have the right skills or staff size to keep up with SecOps and analytics. AI-based security solutions can operate 24/7 and automate much of the work of lower-level analysts, allowing for fewer and lower-cost SOC personnel while significantly reducing the time to detect and remediate threats.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Top trends in AI, and what AI means for your SecOps team</h3>
<p>Currently, there are three main trends for AI usage in the SOC.</p>
<h4>1. Malware detection</h4>
<p>Malware detection is perhaps the most popular application of AI in the SOC. Historically, detection has focused on malware signatures, but this activity has become increasingly difficult as those signatures have grown more dynamic over time. Signature-based detection is also unsuited to first-of-a-kind malware such as advanced persistent threats. With no previous example to reference, a human would essentially have to notice some anomalous behavior to discover this type of malware.</p>
<p>In many SOCs, AI has stepped in. Armed with a decade&#8217;s worth of malware examples, teams can use supervised ML to train detection algorithms to recognize malware based on behaviors rather than signatures.</p>
<p>For example, some activity may look like malware because it has moved from this directory to that directory and then reached out to the network. Once deployed into the environment, SOCs find they can detect more malware than they could before, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephan-jou-7b952" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stephan Jou</a>, CTO of Interset.</p>
<p>Malware detection is the most mature and successful application of AI in the SOC, Jou said, largely because the security teams as a whole has had much experience with malware to learn from. AI does not replace signature-based malware detection, but complements it and makes detection much more effective overall.</p>
<h4>2. User and entity behavior analytics (UEBA)</h4>
<p>With their system-centric focus, SIEMs have a harder time detecting manually executed attacks than those implemented by malware. The anomalies that signal these insider threats—an employee logging into a server he&#8217;s never accessed before, for example—typically have to be spotted by a human analyst. That kind of serendipity is in short supply in resource-strapped SOCs.</p>
<p>AI is filling in the gaps here, too, employing UEBA. UEBA uses a technique known as anomaly detection, which is driven by unsupervised ML.</p>
<p>UEBA monitors the behavior for every user within the organization and learns what is &#8220;normal&#8221; so it can recognize activity that is &#8220;abnormal.&#8221; A typical example would be recognizing that John, who never logs in after work hours and always accesses machines A, B, and C, has suddenly logged in at 2 a.m. and accessed machines E and F. It can then process this information and determine whether the behavior is prelude to an attack.</p>
<p>The benefits of behavioral analytics are clear; with them the SOC can better detect hacked insider threats, privileged accounts, and brute-force attacks. However, UEBA adoption slowed early when tooling vendors overpromised on results. As companies have realized that UEBA, and AI in general, complement existing technologies rather than replaces them, it has been more widely embraced in the SOC.</p>
<p>&#8220;The use cases are starting to come out, and the customer stories are real now,&#8221; Interset&#8217;s Jou said. &#8220;I hear more and more companies saying they’re finding things they couldn&#8217;t have found before with traditional tools.&#8221;</p>
<h4>3. Threat hunting</h4>
<p>AI is also having an impact on threat hunting. That may at first seem counterintuitive when you consider how much this proactive technique relies on the human brain. Highly skilled security professionals hypothesize potential attacks in their heads, based on a vast knowledge of the threat landscape. Then, working under the assumption that attackers have already penetrated the system, they attempt to detect, isolate, and contain or eliminate sophisticated threats that slip past automated defenses.</p>
<p>But threat hunting relies on analyzing huge volumes of security data, and virtually all of it can be automated using a combination of traditional and cutting-edge technologies, according to Interset&#8217;s Jou. Threat hunting is probably the most immature of the AI applications in the SOC, he said, but it&#8217;s the skill that&#8217;s most in demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most SOCs don&#8217;t have threat hunters; they need to contract that out&#8221; or use a managed service, he said. &#8220;If you have one or two on your team, you&#8217;re very, very lucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are still tools that &#8220;we need to build to completely automate the things a threat hunter would do to make them more effective,&#8221; he said. But this AI application &#8220;is the one that has the most promise.&#8221;</p>
<h4>Future applications</h4>
<p>ML is what &#8220;a lot of people in security think about when they think of AI,&#8221; Jou said. &#8220;But AI is actually a lot more. There are things you can do in AI that go way beyond just learning things and finding patterns that are weird.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sees the SOC employing AI for optimization and recommendation. For example, many cellphone providers currently use AI-enabled customer service systems that look at the caller&#8217;s case history, including how many complaints they&#8217;ve made in the past and their severity. Then they recommend a course of action to the customer service rep that&#8217;s been optimized for customer retention.</p>
<p>He sees a similar approach being applied to threat hunting, where an AI-based system could look at the worldwide history of attacks, make a determination on a threat in that context, and recommend how best to contain that threat.</p>
<p>Jou also foresees natural-language processing playing a bigger role in threat hunting. &#8220;Remember,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the threat hunter has made a hypothesis in his head, then he&#8217;s having a dialogue with the data he has around him to try and figure out what might be happening in the organization. I would love for that dialogue to be a much more natural interface, almost like a conversation with the data as opposed to a building a query syntax.&#8221; </p>
<p>Technically, &#8220;we can already create that conversational interface; we just haven&#8217;t done it yet,&#8221; Jou said.</p>
<h4>AI&#8217;s eventual influence on the SOC</h4>
<p>Given how dramatically AI is redefining cybersecurity, it&#8217;s a given that it will impact the makeup of the SOC and how it conducts its daily business. The debate is over how deep and broad that effect will eventually be. </p>
<p>The industry agrees on one thing: AI is not meant to replace workers en masse. All the AI applications discussed here augment the efforts of the SOC team and help them to be more efficient. AI is also not meant to replace the SIEM or any other tool that&#8217;s already proving effective.</p>
<p>But while AI won&#8217;t replace jobs or commodity tools, it can, and probably should, replace tasks. In fact, when it&#8217;s implemented wisely, AI can help the SOC reclaim and reallocate resources. For example, monitoring, prioritizing, and triaging security alerts, the basic duties of a Tier 1 analyst, can be performed just as well by automation and orchestration technologies, which also scale more easily.</p>
<p>That allows organizations to move their Tier-1 analysts up into Tier-2 roles, such as incident analysis and response. Respond Software&#8217;s Triolo said this increases the security team&#8217;s capabilities without increasing its budget.</p>
<p>Similarly, tools such as anomaly detection don&#8217;t replace the need for human vetting but ideally allow security engineers to focus on fewer and more targeted incidents and to waste less time digging through logs and alerts, said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/platypii" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kenny Daniel</a>, founder of ML vendor Algorithmia.</p>
<h4>A need for more SOC data science</h4>
<p>AI tools will shift the balance of the SOC in another way, Daniel said. Teams will need <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/how-machine-learning-improves-your-security-predictions" rel="noopener noreferrer">stronger data science representation</a> to manage their new ML tools and to understand the data and signals available, as well as to help engineer defenses for their particular systems.</p>
<p>Generally, this will mean hiring people with higher levels of training or require additional training for existing team members. But &#8220;while that may come with a higher cost in the beginning,&#8221; using these tools to help streamline your response might mean you need fewer people to do the work, said <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-schonfeld/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ryan Schonfeld</a>, founder and CEO of RAS Watch, a security incident-management tool.</p>
<p>Another option for this is outsourcing your SOC functions—either some of them or all—to a company that already has these tools in place to reduce cost and increase value for the company.</p>
<p>Ultimately, AI doesn’t radically change the skill requirements for the SOC but instead maximizes the ones it already has on hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;If AI is effective, it also frees up analysts to do higher-order thinking, applying judgment, organizational knowledge, and relationships,&#8221; said <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaackohn/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Isaac Kohn</a>, a risk advisory principal at Deloitte. &#8220;So those skills are more important than ever.&#8221;</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How to select the right tool</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s tempting for SOCs to start their AI transformation by acquiring the trendiest tools. But you should employ a more strategic approach to ensure a successful result. Here are the essential factors for tool selection.</p>
<h4>Start with the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve</h4>
<p>It can&#8217;t be said enough that choosing the right AI solution should start with clarifying the issues your SOC struggles with most. Are you missing breaches? Do you have a malware problem? Did a rogue employee delete some important data? Are your analysts wasting time on repetitive tasks at the expense of more business-critical activities?</p>
<p>AI can help with all of these issues, but they require different types of tools, and throwing the wrong one at a problem will inevitably lead to wasted time and resources. So, for example, if you&#8217;re looking for a malware-detection tool, don&#8217;t confuse that with network threat analysis or risk mitigation. </p>
<p>Take the time to reflect on which security issues you&#8217;re most concerned about—and, specifically, what you&#8217;re being asked to report to leadership about—as a way to gain clarity around how AI can help you, Interset&#8217;s Jou recommended.</p>
<h4>Make sure you have the data</h4>
<p>Data is the fuel of AI. The larger the quantity and the better the quality of the data you put in, the faster and more accurate solutions AI will produce. As such, security leaders must ask the following questions about their data to maximize their AI efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Do you have the data? </strong>The goal is to have enough to represent every context that a system may encounter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is it &#8220;good&#8221; data? </strong>AI is only as good as the data you feed it. That means it should be accurate over a long period of time, with few inconsistencies, errors, or corruptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is the data labeled? </strong>Supervised ML requires data to be labeled in order to identify the properties or characteristics that can be used to train the algorithm. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is the data up to date? </strong>The threat landscape evolves at lightning speed, so current data is essential. A system trained using old data will struggle to detect the latest threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the source of the data? </strong>Make sure the data you intend to use is from a trusted source. Data from a suspect source may be inaccurate, corrupt, or even perverted by data sample poisoning, when a malicious user injects false training data to thwart the learning model.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&#8217;s common for organizations to find it has unclean or unlabeled data, those hurdles can be overcome with the help of third-party services. If, however you find your organization doesn&#8217;t have the required data or the skill to understand it, Interset&#8217;s Daigle said, you&#8217;re at an earlier stage of maturity and you may have to take a step back before you start buying tools.</p>
<h4>Decide whether to build or buy your AI</h4>
<p>Here again, 451 Research&#8217;s Montenegro said, you need a clear understanding of just what your business requirements are. Do you have specific needs related to your organization, such as compliance, complexity, risk tolerance, different threat models, specific resource constraints, or other considerations?</p>
<p>These answers are essential for your organization to determine whether you&#8217;re going to undertake AI tool development yourself or if you&#8217;re going to work with an AI-powered tool from an external provider—or something in between, he said.</p>
<p>Once you have your business criteria nailed down, weigh them against the relative pros and cons of building versus buying an AI solution. </p>
<p><strong>Building AI in-house</strong></p>
<p>A do-it-yourself approach allows you to build an AI solution tailored to your organization&#8217;s needs instead of paying for a package that likely includes features you&#8217;ll never use. It offers greater flexibility, allowing you to modify it on the fly and optimize it for future needs.</p>
<p>The downside is the time commitment and skills required. Deploying the system, training the data, reducing false positives, and the other considerable hurdles may require years of effort and come at a great cost. And that&#8217;s assuming you have the expertise in-house, which most organizations don&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>Buying packaged software</strong></p>
<p>Many of the advantages of buying an AI solution are the same that come with working with any third-party service. The vendor shoulders the infrastructure and maintenance expenses, as well as many of the security responsibilities, and sometimes ensures compatibility with other software.</p>
<p>This approach also provides the AI expertise most organizations lack and can leverage best practices from other clients to improve the implementation and performance of the product.</p>
<p>However, as is the case with any emerging technology, many vendors merely bolt AI onto their existing products, and almost all use their customers for research and development.</p>
<p>This can create a learning curve that can lead to lost time and money, especially in the short term. Feature bloat is also a potential problem for those organizations that need more customized solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Other factors to keep in mind</strong></p>
<p>Whichever route you decide is best for your company, it&#8217;s fundamental to have serious, realistic expectations about AI tools&#8217; capabilities and applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any tool that deals in absolutes or near absolutes warrants a lot of suspicion,&#8221; 451 Research&#8217;s Montenegro said. The tooling should match the expected usage.</p>
<p>If yours is a SOC team that prefers to experiment with building your own tools and models, for example, choosing a tool that only uses AI internally and delivers the results to you may not be what you&#8217;re looking for, he added.</p>
<p>The reverse is also true, he said: Choosing an AI development platform that &#8220;expects you to do the heavy lifting&#8221; in terms of creating the data pipelines, the models, etc., &#8220;when all you want is results, is not going to help you either.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>AI is transforming the SOC. As cyber attacks on organizations become more organized and efficient, augmenting your team&#8217;s analysts with AI-enabled tools gives you the best chance of gaining the upper hand.</p>
<p>Consider these steps to put your AI plan into action:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Start with the problem you want to solve, not with the “cool tool.” </strong>Understand that tools alone don’t solve business or security problems. Many organizations invest repeatedly in emerging tools—including AI—without fixing the operational or organizational issues that prevent them from achieving their desired outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Think realistically about how far you want to go with AI. </strong>Do you want to build your own tools and models, or do you just want to consume results? If the former, make sure you have the time and resources to commit to building and managing your own solution. If the latter, make sure you have the expertise, such as a data scientist or other tech staff, to vet vendors and evaluate their offerings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Determine whether you have enough data</strong> within your organization to properly train the models that you&#8217;re going to use or if you would you be better served by an external provider that has access to other customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make sure the basics are in place</strong>—namely an established control fabric and sensor grid. A good foundation for security operations is a log management strategy that allows you to store, search, and analyze data for investigations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>With the basics in place, you can focus on implementing security automation and workflow.</strong> This will increase the organization&#8217;s ability to isolate high-priority incidents, while maximizing the efficiency of the analyst team. Team leads should focus efforts on automating areas that are major time burdens on the staff or areas where humans don&#8217;t typically perform well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay focused on your objectives and be thoughtful about how to measure them. <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/software-security-measuring-stick-takes-it-all" rel="noopener noreferrer">Different organizations have different priorities</a>, whether it&#8217;s reducing the number of successfully executed attacks or reducing costs by being more effective with the security resources already in place.</p>
<h4>Keep learning</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>Detrimental lies are not new. Even misleading headlines and text can fool a reader.  However, the ability to alter reality has taken a leap forward with “deepfake” technology which allows for the creation of images and videos of real people saying and doing things they never said or did. Deep learning techniques are escalating the technology’s finesse, producing even more realistic content that is increasingly difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Deepfakes began to gain attention when a fake pornography video featuring a “Wonder Woman” actress was released on Reddit in late 2017 by a user with the pseudonym “deepfakes.” Several doctored videos have since been released featuring high-profile celebrities, some of which were purely for entertainment value and others which have portrayed public figures in a demeaning light. This presents a real threat. The internet already distorts the truth as information on social media is presented and consumed through the filter of our own cognitive biases.</p>
<p>Deepfakes will intensify this problem significantly. Celebrities, politicians and even commercial brands can face unique forms of threat tactics, intimidation, and personal image sabotage. The risks to our democracy, justice, politics and national security are serious as well. Imagine a dark web economy where deepfakers produce misleading content that can be released to the world to influence which car we buy, which supermarket we frequent, and even which political candidate receives our vote. Deepfakes can touch all areas of our lives; hence, basic protection is essential.</p>
<h2><strong>How are Deepfakes Created?</strong></h2>
<p>Deepfakes are a cutting-edge advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) often leveraged by bad actors who use the technology to generate increasingly realistic and convincing fake images, videos, voice, and text. These videos are created by the superimposition of existing images, audio, and videos onto source media files by leveraging an advanced deep learning technique called “Generative Adversarial Networks” (GANs). GANs are relatively recent concepts in AI which aim to synthesize artificial images that are indistinguishable from authentic ones. The GAN approach brings two neural networks to work simultaneously: one network called the “generator” draws on a dataset to produce a sample that mimics it. The other network, known as the “discriminator”, assesses the degree to which the generator succeeded. Iteratively, the assessments of the discriminator inform the assessments of the generator. The increasing sophistication of GAN approaches has led to the production of ever more convincing and nearly impossible to expose deepfakes, and the result far exceeds the speed, scale, and nuance of what human reviewers could achieve.</p>
<h2><strong>McAfee Deepfakes Lab Applies Data Science Expertise to Detect Bogus Videos </strong></h2>
<p>To mitigate this threat, McAfee today announced the launch of the McAfee Deepfakes Lab to focus the company’s world-class data science expertise and tools on countering the  deepfake menace to individuals, organizations, democracy and the overall integrity of information across our society. The Deepfakes Lab combines computer vision and deep learning techniques to exploit hidden patterns and detect manipulated video elements that play a key role in authenticating original media files. <em> </em></p>
<p>To ensure the prediction results of the deep learning framework and the origin of solutions for each prediction are understandable, we spent a significant amount of time visualizing the layers and filters of our networks then added a model-agnostic explainability framework on top of the detection framework. Having explanations for each prediction helps us make an informed decision about how much we trust the image and the model as well as provide insights that can be used to improve the latter.</p>
<p>We also performed detailed validation and verification of the detection framework on a large dataset and tested detection capability on deepfake content found in the wild. Our detection framework was able to detect a recent deepfake video of Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg giving a brief speech about the power of big data. The tool not only provided an accurate detection score but generated heatmaps via the model-agnostic explainability module highlighting the parts of his face contributing to the decision, thereby adding trust in our predictions.</p>
<p>Such easily available deepfakes reiterate the challenges that social networks face when it comes to policing manipulated content. As advancements in GAN techniques produce very realistic looking fake images, advanced computer vision techniques will need to be developed to identify and detect advanced forms of deepfakes. Additionally, steps need to be taken to defend against deepfakes by making use of watermarks or authentication trails.</p>
<h2><strong>Sounding the Alarm</strong></h2>
<p>We realize that news media do have considerable power in shaping people’s beliefs and opinions. As a consequence, their truthfulness is often compromised to maximize impact. The dictum “a picture is worth a thousand words” accentuates the significance of the deepfake phenomenon. Credible yet fraudulent audio, video, and text will have a much larger impact that can be used to ruin celebrity and brand reputations as well as influence political opinion with terrifying implications. Computer vision and deep learning detection frameworks can authenticate and detect fake visual media and text content, but the damage to reputations and influencing opinion remains.</p>
<p>In launching the Deepfakes Lab, McAfee will work with traditional news and social media organizations to identify malicious deepfakes videos during this crucial 2020 national election season and help combat this new wave of disinformation associated with deepfakes.</p>
<p>In our next blog on deepfakes, we will demonstrate our detailed detection framework. With this framework, we will be helping to battle disinformation and minimize the growing challenge of deepfakes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This spring, Sauce Labs announced the Sauce Testrunner Toolkit (beta) to expand developer-first capabilities and support for native JavaScript frameworks.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>This spring, Sauce Labs announced the <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/platform/sauce-testrunner-toolkit" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sauce Testrunner Toolkit (beta)</a> to expand developer-first capabilities and support for native JavaScript frameworks. The Testrunner Toolkit makes setting up, writing, and running web tests easier and faster for developers during early pipeline testing. First it supported Puppeteer, followed by Cypress, TestCafe, and Playwright to provide the flexibility to test the way you want, along with Sauce Labs insights, at scale. </p>
<p>Now, you can speed up your native JavaScript tests by running tests in parallel within your CI/CD environment. This capability is available with any Sauce Labs account, and you can get started for free! This means you can make the most of your existing infrastructure without new investments, while still getting insights within Sauce Labs. </p>
<h3>How to Run Cypress Tests in Parallel with Sauce Labs</h3>
<p>In this example we’ll take a look at setting up and running Cypress tests in parallel using the Sauce Testrunner Toolkit with GitHub Actions. Then we will view the test results in the Sauce Labs UI.</p>
<p><i>Note: Find examples for using other test frameworks or CI/CD examples in the </i><a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.saucelabs.com/testrunner-toolkit/docs/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a><i>. </i></p>
<p>Prerequisites: You’ll need a <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/sign-up" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sauce Labs</a> and a GitHub account. You will also need existing cypress tests. In our example we have multiple tests located in the <code>./tests/e2e/cypress directory.</code></p>
<p>1. In your root project directory, create the following directory tree: <code>.github/workflows.</code> </p>
<p>2. And then add your Sauce Labs credentials to the GitHub Actions Secret Settings. </p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Add a <code>./sauce/config.yml</code>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/saucelabs/saucectl/blob/master/.sauce/puppeteer_parallel.yml" rel="noopener noreferrer">similar to this example</a>, and set <code>parallel</code> to <code>true</code>. </p>
<p><i>a. This will distribute and run the tests across as many jobs as you have defined in your CI</i></p>
<pre><code>parallel: true</code></pre>
<p>4. Create Github Action test.yml <code>.github/workflows/test.yml</code>. </p>
<p>In this example, we’re adding two parallel jobs: <code>cypress-parallel-1</code> and <code>cypress-parallel-2</code></p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/2sWXRum9WKdqiB7yZ0WvFA/72c064799c975f1fbd2733040dadcd4c/Screen_Shot_2020-10-14_at_1.17.44_PM.png?fm=webp" alt="Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 1.17.44 PM" title="Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 1.17.44 PM"/></p>
<p>5. Now, when you commit these files, GitHub will detect the new workflow actions and launch <code>saucectl</code> to run your tests. 	</p>
<p>The output may look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/3LJfkeLabtwaPOuzbet5zP/1a6d5379b08e757eda42ac77e533fcf3/github-action-parallel-results.png?fm=webp" alt="github-action-parallel-results" title="github-action-parallel-results"/></p>
<p>Congrats! The tests are now running in parallel with the help of the Sauce Testrunner Toolkit and you can view screenshots, videos and <a target="_blank" href="https://app.saucelabs.com/dashboard/tests/vdc" rel="noopener noreferrer">test results in Sauce Labs</a>.   </p>
<p>Sauce Labs is committed to supporting our users in delivering digital confidence, and providing what they need to test better, test faster, and test at scale. </p>
<h3>What’s Next</h3>
<p>Developers currently using Sauce Labs Testrunner Toolkit can run tests locally, or in their CI/CD pipelines, and then view the results in the Sauce Labs UI. In our next iterations, you will be able to configure tests from Testrunner Toolkit to execute in our virtual cloud environment. This will increase scalability and reliability to help developers truly embrace quality without sacrificing speed.</p>
<h3>Try It For Yourself! </h3>
<p>The Sauce Testrunner Toolkit beta is completely free! If you’d like to try it out for yourself, head over to our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/saucelabs/testrunner-toolkit" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github repo</a> where you can get started right away.</p>
<p>Happy Testing! </p>

As we have seen above, shadowRoot interface is the only entry point to the Shadow DOM tree when the mode is OPEN. In the case of CLOSED mode, we can not access any Shadow DOM tree elements. In simple terms we can say – we can not automate CLOSED mode Shadow DOM tree elements.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the CLOSED mode Shadow DOM tree is business-critical to automate, then we can ask our developers to keep the mode OPEN on the test environment sandbox, so that we can automate/run it. Developers still can keep CLOSED mode on the production environment.<br /></span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">                                                                                  OR </span></i></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The developers can make OPEN/CLOSED mode as configurable for automation engineers. </span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><b><span style="color: #333399;"><span style="color: #000080;">Q: </span>How to interact with multi-level Shadow Root elements?</span></b><b><br /></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">To see the multilevel Shadow DOM tree elements on your machine, get the source code from my </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/VirenderPannu/polymer3-letsplanapp" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repo</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and execute locally. Whenever you run the code locally, it will open up a web application {implemented with Google’s Polymer library} on the browser and then you can see a multi-level Shadow DOM tree through the browser console.  </span></p>

<h2><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understood how QA Automation folks can interact with custom elements WITH / WITHOUT appending Shadow DOM.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">We got familiar with the role of the Open/Closed mode of Shadow Root, while finding the elements.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Got to know the limitations of regular selectors {Xpath, CSS} with Shadow DOM.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understood how to interact with multi-level Shadow Root elements.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clear thought on how TestProject’s OpenSDK supports Shadow DOM elements.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now we are pretty familiar with the Shadow DOM tree and its interaction with TestProject’s OpenSDK. But still, we have a few open questions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does TestProject <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/easy-test-automation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">record/playback</a> support Shadow DOM elements?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few more interesting aspects of the Shadow DOM tree?</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="entry-content">
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.neotys.com/neoload/whats-new" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NeoLoad 7.6</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> introduces new dashboard features, advanced updates to APIs and as-code capabilities, and enhanced search functionality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the highlights: We’ve made NeoLoad dashboards more powerful and flexible. Our APIs are now more extensible so you can integrate chaos testing campaigns, export raw data to a third-party system, manage your workspaces more systematically and stop a test from within a virtual user path. As-code validation capabilities have been enhanced, and we’ve introduced advanced settings for as-code scenarios. We added more search functionality so you can get to test results faster. And more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2>What’s New in This Release?</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Dashboard</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – New analysis and graph capabilities have been added to the dashboard. You are now able to analyze and share tables and text-editable comment fields, as well as export graphs in PNG format.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>APIs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – The NeoLoad REST and JavaScript APIs have several new capabilities.  You can now declare external events that will appear in Neoload Web test results values; extract raw data from Neoload Web; programmatically create, update and delete workspaces; and use the JavaScript API to stop a test if a virtual user experiences an issue during the test.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>As Code</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Test as code now includes additional advanced features like assertions and custom load policy, and new capabilities to guarantee that the test is running as expected.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Test Search</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Tests can be searched by name in the advanced search window on the dashboard. Access to test results is now even faster.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Feature enhancements</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are also included in this release.</span></li>
</ul>
