					<description><![CDATA[  Election 2020: Keep on the Lookout for Fake News Before and After the Election As the news and conversations]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />

<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p> </p>
<h2>Election 2020: Keep on the Lookout for Fake News Before and After the Election</h2>
<p>As the news and conversations leading up to Election Day intensify, and with early voting already in full swing, the flood of misinformation and outright disinformation online continues—and will undoubtedly continue in the days after as the results are tabulated and announced.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ve seen some instances of it yourself. For instance, one recent news story reported that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ballots-california-landfill/" rel="noopener noreferrer">numerous legitimate social media accounts have shared misinformation about the vote</a>. An example: photos of old, empty election envelopes that were properly disposed of after the 2018 election, used to make the false claim that they were uncounted votes from the 2020 election. It’d be naïve for us to think that postings like this, and others, would suddenly come to a halt on Election Day.</p>
<h3>We can expect election misinformation to continue even after Election Day</h3>
<p>I touched upon this topic in my earlier blog about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/election-2020-keep-misinformation-from-undermining-the-vote/" rel="noopener noreferrer">how misinformation online</a> can undermine our election, yet it’s worthy of underscoring once again. It’s easy for our attention to focus on the days leading up to the election, however, this election stands to be like few others as the high volume of mail-in ballots may keep us from knowing who the certified victor is for possibly weeks after Election Day.<br />How that timeline plays out in practice remains to be seen, yet we should all prepare ourselves for a glut of continued misinformation and disinformation that aims to cloud the process. Feeds will get filled with it, and it’ll be up to us to make sense of what’s true and what’s false out there.</p>
<h3>Who is fact checking posts on social media sites?</h3>
<p>Sadly, much of onus for fact-checking will fall on us, particularly when <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2019/10/11/more-americans-are-getting-their-news-from-social-media/#5021c96c3e17" rel="noopener noreferrer">55% of Americans say</a> they “often” or “sometimes” get their news via social media. There are a few reasons why:</p>
<p>• First, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2020/fact-checkers-support-twitter-labels-but-more-than-that-they-want-transparency/" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media platforms are new to fact-checking</a> and their processes are still developing, particularly around the transparency of their fact-checking methodology;<br />• Secondly, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-twitter-fact-checking-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">corporate leadership of the two major social media platforms</a> have stated differing views about fact checking on their platforms;<br />• And third, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/every-minute-internet-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer">sheer volume of posts</a> that these platforms pump out in any given day (or minute!) make it difficult to fact-check posts at scale.</p>
<p>Where does that leave us? In unprecedented times.</p>
<p>Historically, we’ve always had to be savvy consumers of news, where a balanced diet of media consumption allowed us to develop a clearer picture of events. Yet now, in a time of unfiltered social media, news comes to us from a multitude of publishers, bloggers, and individuals. And within that mix, it’s difficult to immediately know who the editorial teams behind those stories are—what their intentions, credentials, and leanings are—and if they’re drawing their information from bona fide, verified sources. The result is that we must read and view everything today with an increased level of healthy skepticism.</p>
<h3>Fact-checking your news</h3>
<p>That takes work, yet my recent blog on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/spot-fake-news-and-misinformation-in-your-social-media-feed/" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Spot Fake News and Misinformation in Your Social Media Feed</a> offers you a leg up with several pointers to help you sniff out potential falsehoods.<br />In addition, here’s a short list of fact-checking resources that you can turn to when something questionable comes up in your feed. Likewise, they make for good browsing even if you don’t have a specific story that you want to check up on. You can keep these handy:</p>
<p>• <a target="_blank" href="https://www.politifact.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PolitiFact</a> from the Poynter Institute<br />• <a target="_blank" href="https://www.factcheck.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">FactCheck.org</a> from the Annenberg Public Policy Center<br />• <a target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ap-fact-check" rel="noopener noreferrer">AP News Fact Check</a> from the Associated Press<br />• <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/fact-check" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters Fact Check</a> from Reuters News<br />• <a target="_blank" href="https://www.snopes.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snopes.com</a> from Snopes Media Group</p>
<h3>Stay vigilant</h3>
<p>With the election just days away and a result that may not be declared at the end of Election Day, we all need to scrutinize the news that presents itself to us, particularly on social media. Fact-checking what you see and read, along with cross-referencing it with multiple, reputable sources, will help you get the best information possible—which is absolutely vital when it comes time to cast your ballot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Agile and DevOps have defined the last two decades in software delivery. Value stream management (VSM) will define the next one.</p>
<p>Even as recently as 2000, there was little information about agile and few jobs calling for expertise in that area. Ten years ago, the same was true for DevOps. Today a similar situation exists if you search for VSM.</p>
<p>While many <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/devops-careers-tb/7-key-devops-roles?lx=vimF_R&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">careers have been built around agile and DevOps </a>over the past 20 years, it has not been enough to help enterprises truly compete in the increasingly digital world.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/6-key-value-streams-drive-digital-transformation" rel="noopener noreferrer">VSM is fundamentally different</a> because it looks holistically from ideation to delivery and will deliver on the promises that agile and DevOps could never fulfill. Here&#8217;s why, and what your software team needs to know.</p>
<h3>DevOps is part of a bigger picture</h3>
<p>Agile sped up development to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb/high-perf-continuous-delivery?lx=-DC2cJ&amp;custom_url=continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">accelerate value delivery</a>, while DevOps removed the bottlenecks between development and operations for further gains. Yet that&#8217;s only part of the value stream.</p>
<p>Being good at CI/CD and code-to-cloud are necessary, but they are insufficient to remain competitive, given the breakneck speed of tech developments.</p>
<p>You must consider the end-to-end flow of <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/optimize-devops-tb/devops-scale-software-factory?lx=vm26kZ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">all the software delivery work</a> that creates and protects business value. After all, most organizations spend half their time and half the budgeted money before a card ever gets to a development team&#8217;s backlog.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why VSM is vital: It doesn’t just focus on accelerating one silo; it focuses on accelerating the whole system.</p>
<h3>What VSM helps you do</h3>
<p><span>VSM in software delivery is a progressively maturing practice that takes a systematic approach to measure and improving end-to-end flow. It helps organizations to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Shorten time-to-market</span></li>
<li><span>Increase throughput</span></li>
<li><span>Improve product quality</span></li>
<li><span>Optimize for business outcomes, such as increased revenue and customer retention</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top:12.0pt; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt">Accelerating value work requires an understanding of what value is. In <a target="_blank" href="https://projecttoproduct.org/the-book/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><em>Project to Product</em>,</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/mik_kersten" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mik Kersten</a> helps technology leaders articulate that by defining four flow items that someone is willing to exchange for an economic unit.</p>
<p style="margin-top:12.0pt; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt">This data is abstracted from complex software delivery tool chains that enterprises use to manage the complex flow of work. Flow items deliver:</p>
<p style="margin-top:12.0pt; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt"> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Features: New business value</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fewer defects: Quality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk management: Security, governance, compliance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical debt reduction: Removals of impediments to future delivery</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An organization’s focus must be on prioritizing, optimizing, and balancing the flow of these items across your software portfolio.</p>
<p>For that, you need the right type of measurement. As <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/adrianco" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Adrian Cockcroft</a>, vice president of cloud architecture strategy at Amazon Web Services, puts it in <em><a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/cloud-for-ceos/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cloud for CEOs</a></em>: &#8220;The most critical metric is how long it takes for an innovative idea to reach a customer. If it takes your company months, how can you compete with an organization that delivers in days?&#8221;</p>
<h3>New practices require new measures</h3>
<p>Unlike &#8220;discipline&#8221; metrics that focus on activities in a specific area of the value stream (such as DORA and DevOps), VSM requires <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/devops-value-stream-mapping-why-you-need-metrics" rel="noopener noreferrer">end-to-end metrics</a> that rise above all practices and processes to focus on the flow of business value.</p>
<p>These metrics need to measure the rate of business value delivery for software products through the lens of your customers (whether internal or external) to help you understand your current state.</p>
<p>They allow you to determine where work is flowing and, more importantly, where it isn’t. They provide shared visibility into business and development metrics for everyone involved in the value stream. That includes members of the leadership team, who are often balancing resources and budgets across a portfolio. Where will those budgets produce the highest ROI in terms of improved flow?</p>
<p>Here are a few metrics that will help you measure this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flow velocity</strong> gauges whether value delivery is accelerating. It is the number of flow items of each type completed over a particular period of time, allowing you to measure throughput.</li>
<li><strong>Flow time</strong> can identify when time-to-value is getting longer. It measures the time it takes for flow items to go from &#8220;work start&#8221; to &#8220;work complete,&#8221; including both active and wait times. This allows you to measure time-to-market, to ensure your throughput is fast enough for the short feedback cycles needed when dealing with uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>Flow efficiency</strong> can identify when waste is increasing or decreasing in your processes. It is the ratio of active time versus wait time out of the total flow time.</li>
<li><strong>Flow load</strong> monitors over- and under-utilization of value streams, which can lead to reduced productivity. It measures the number of flow items currently in progress (active or waiting) within a particular value stream.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flow time provides a customer- and business-centric measure of time-to-market, and flow velocity does the same for throughput. Flow efficiency measures how effective investment turns into value, and flow load is an early-warning indicator of overloaded value streams declining due to too much work-in-progress.</p>
<p>Each of these is based on end-to-end flow through a value stream. For example, the flow time clock starts when work is started—for instance, via a commitment to a plan item or objective. It does not stop until running software has been delivered.</p>
<p>As such, these measurements avoid the pitfalls associated with measuring just the cycle time of development or the time from code commit to code deploy, which can be an order of magnitude shorter than the bottlenecks upstream of development.</p>
<p>Using these value stream metrics, we can glean insights to create a culture based on data-driven continuous improvement.</p>
<h3>Reach the summit of data-driven continuous improvement</h3>
<p>Many teams appear mature in their use of agile and DevOps practices but are not mature when it comes to the cultural side of implementing continuous improvement.</p>
<p>First, how are your teams measuring maturity? Is the goal to do DevOps well? Are you measuring outcomes, or are you simply measuring activities? The goal is not to implement all of the DevOps practices; it is to accelerate the delivery and protection of business value.</p>
<p>Maybe you don&#8217;t need to put all DevOps practices into play. Maybe different teams <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/whats-wrong-your-value-stream-mapping" rel="noopener noreferrer">need different practices</a>. It&#8217;s a mistake to simply implement this practice or that one without having a measure of what it can provide from the perspective of the business.</p>
<p>You’ve got to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-you-should-drop-it-speak-measure-success-business-terms" rel="noopener noreferrer">know what the business needs</a> first—what is the problem? What will unlock the flow of business value?</p>
<p>The age of VSM is about measuring what matters in terms of business results. This provides the ability to look at these problems differently. You need to create a continuous feedback loop between IT and the business, to supercharge market response and adaptability to compete with the giants of the digital age.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article I’ll show you how to create comprehensible and professional HTML reports for your C# Selenium WebDriver tests, using <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a> 100% free test automation platform.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Why we need reports</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test automation reporting is the most important activity that will make the automated testing effort more visible. The reports can be shared with the team, the manager, or even clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good report shows what scripts were executed, the steps executed, tests execution times, which tests and steps passed or failed, and screenshots of failures. It is detailed enough to help understand why the failures occurred – especially if it is a failure in the test script or a failure in the application under test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But using an effective reporting mechanism has other benefits, apart from seeing passed/failed results. In time, it can help increase test coverage, test quality, and in the end, improve the quality of the product being tested. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Why Selenium WebDriver is not enough</strong></h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selenium WebDriver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a collection of APIs that allow the automation of browser interaction, such as page navigation, clicking buttons, filling out forms, and other common actions a regular user might perform in a browser. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Selenium WebDriver is the most popular tool used for web test automation, it cannot be used as a standalone tool to perform tests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a proper test automation framework, you need a test runner (think </span><a target="_blank" href="https://junit.org/junit5/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JUnit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a target="_blank" href="https://testng.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TestNG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a target="_blank" href="https://nunit.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NUnit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a target="_blank" href="https://xunit.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">XUnit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-mstest" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSTest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and a good reporting tool. Selenium WebDriver alone does not provide the option to make assertions that verify that the functionality works as expected, and also does not provide reporting capabilities. You can read more about reporting solutions in this comparison article: <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/08/12/8-leading-test-reporting-tools-for-selenium/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 8 Leading Test Reporting Tools for Selenium</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where TestProject comes in – providing complete <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/executive-test-reports/" rel="noopener noreferrer">test reports</a>, that include test results, screenshots for steps performed, trends (number of tests executed on each test run, number of tests passed/failed), and test duration.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Setting up the environment for TestProject testing</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is to create a new (free) </span><a target="_blank" href="https://app.testproject.io/signup/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TestProject</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> account. Once you have set up your account, download the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-agents/what-is-a-testproject-agent" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject Agent</a> for desktop, for the operating system you are using – it is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (and even Docker!). You can do this from the Agents tab in your account. Here is where you also need to register the agent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure to give it a meaningful name, because the agents can be shared between team members. “Jane’s Agent” is a much better name than “Test agent” or “123”. Also start the agent before running any of the tests, otherwise the tests will not start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TestProject allows <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/easy-test-automation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">test creation from the interface</a> as well, by recording the browser/mobile actions, but in this tutorial, we will focus on writing our own tests using <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/advanced-scripting-capabilities/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject’s SDK</a>.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Create your first C# test with TestProject SDK </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now to the fun part.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are reading this article, I’m guessing you already have </span><a target="_blank" href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visual Studio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> installed, if not, go ahead and install it because it’s the IDE we will use to write our tests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a new project in Visual Studio. The selected framework should be .Net Core, and you can work with any test runner you are comfortable with. For this example, we will use </span><a target="_blank" href="https://nunit.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NUnit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as our test runner, so simply select </span><b>NUnit Test Project (.Net Core)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the projects list, name the project, and save it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, add the TestProject </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/TestProject.SDK" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NuGet package</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: right-click on the project name, </span><b>Manage NuGet packages…</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, browse for The TestProject SDK, and install the latest version.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-14584 size-full" title="Add the TestProject NuGet package" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_1.png" alt="Add the TestProject NuGet package" width="512" height="344"/></noscript></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s move on to writing the test. From here, there are very few differences between a Selenium WebDriver test in NUnit and a TestProject test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A test class using TestProject needs to implement one </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SDK.Tests</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interface: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">IWebTest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">IAndroidTest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">IIOSTest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our tests will be web tests that run on Chrome, so the interface we need to use is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">IWebTest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a simple example of a test that logs in </span><a target="_blank" href="https://example.testproject.io/web/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://example.testproject.io/web/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the user “John Smith” and the password “12345”, and checks that the login was successful by verifying the presence of the Logout button:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">using OpenQA.Selenium;
using TestProject.Common.Attributes;
using TestProject.SDK;
using TestProject.SDK.Tests;
using TestProject.SDK.Tests.Helpers;

namespace NUnitTestProject1
{
public class LogInTest : IWebTest
    {
        ExecutionResult IWebTest.Execute(WebTestHelper helper)
        {
            var driver = helper.Driver;
       //open the https://example.testproject.io/web/ webpage
            driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("https://example.testproject.io/web/");
  //Fill in the form with the username and password
            driver.FindElementById("name").SendKeys("John Smith");
            driver.FindElementById("password").SendKeys(password);
            driver.FindElementById("login").Click();
       //Verify that the login was successful 
            if (driver.FindElement(By.Id("logout")).Displayed)
            {
                return ExecutionResult.Passed;
            }                 
     return ExecutionResult.Failed;
    }
}
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s analyze the code: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The test uses <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/category/selenium/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium</a> methods: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">() to open the webpage in browser, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SendKeys</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">() and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">() to interact with the form, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Displayed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to check if the element is present on the page, and the elements are located by their IDs. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebTestHelper</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> class provides access to the driver and other web action resources. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last part is returning the test result – whether the test passed or failed. If the login was successful, then the Logout button (with ID “logout”) is visible on the page, and the test is passed, if not, it means the test failed.  The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ExecutionResults</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are enums from the TestProject SDK, and the available values are: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failed,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suspended</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The result will be shown in the generated report once the test is executed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To run tests, you need to use the Runner class. You can add it to the setup method, so the runner is started before running all the tests in the suite. As I mentioned before, this is an NUnit project, so we’ll use the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">NUnit.Framework</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notations for the test setup, test teardown, and for running the tests:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">using NUnit.Framework;
using TestProject.Common.Enums;
using TestProject.SDK;
using System;
 
namespace NUnitTestProject1
{
    public class NUnitTest1
    {
    	Runner runner;
    	private string DevToken = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("TP_DEV_TOKEN");
    	
    	[OneTimeSetUp]
    	public void SetUp()
    	{        	
        	runner = new RunnerBuilder(DevToken).AsWeb(AutomatedBrowserType.Chrome).Build();
    	}      
    	[OneTimeTearDown]
    	public void TearDown()
    	{
        	runner.Dispose();        	
    	}
    }
}
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can obtain your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevToken</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the TestProject application, in the Integrations tab, and then add it to the code, or better than hardcoding it in the project, set it as an </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">environment variable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and then use the Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable() method to get it. Then it should be passed as a parameter to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">RunnerBuilder.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Now TestProject will recognize the account running the tests and save the reports in that account, where you can access them any time, see them in HTML format or download them as PDFs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, add the login test to this class, this time using the NUnit </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> annotation:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">[Test]
       public void Login()
       {
           runner.Run(new LogInTest());
       }
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After you build the solution, you should see this test in the test Explorer panel of Visual Studio. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-14585 size-full" title="NUnit TestProject Test" alt="NUnit TestProject Test" width="206" height="64" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_2.png"/></p>
<p><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-14585 size-full" title="NUnit TestProject Test" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_2.png" alt="NUnit TestProject Test" width="206" height="64"/></noscript></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, run the test – if everything is set up well, the test should run successfully. Don’t forget to have the TestProject agent running before executing the tests! The test execution is quite fast, but if you go to the Monitor tab, you can see that you have 1 job running, while the test is executing:</span></p>

<p><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14586" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_3-512x225.png" alt="" width="512" height="225" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_3-512x225.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_3-768x337.png 768w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_3.png 822w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"/></noscript></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also download the demo code from </span><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/andreea-qa/TestProjectDemo" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GitHub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><strong>The HTML Reports in TestProject</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now when you open the TestProject app in the browser and go to the Reports tab, you can see the results of the test that just ran.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The test was successful, so the HTML report should display this status. Moving through the available charts in the Trends and Reports page of the HTML report, you can see other useful information about the project: the number of tests run, the number of executions, the test results, the result trends, the agent used (remember before, when you had to name the agent? This is where that name can be seen), the platform (Web, Android, iOS). The chart can also be filtered to display only the most recent test results, the default value is for the last 30 days, but other options are available, as well as the option to customize the range. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our particular case, we only have one test run, containing a single test, so this information is displayed in the Trends and Reports. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-14587 size-full" title="TestProject HTML Report" alt="TestProject HTML Report" width="447" height="262" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_4.png"/></p>
<p><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-14587 size-full" title="TestProject HTML Report" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_4.png" alt="TestProject HTML Report" width="447" height="262"/></noscript></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, if you click on the project name, you will be redirected to a more detailed report for the project. This report shows all available runs (the date and time the tests were run), and statistics for each selected run:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-14588 size-full" title="TestProject Test Report" alt="TestProject Test Report" width="1027" height="392" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_5.png 1027w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_5-512x195.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_5-768x293.png 768w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_5-1024x391.png 1024w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1027px) 100vw, 1027px" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_5.png"/></p>
<p><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-14588 size-full" title="TestProject Test Report" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_5.png" alt="TestProject Test Report" width="1027" height="392" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_5.png 1027w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_5-512x195.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_5-768x293.png 768w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_5-1024x391.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1027px) 100vw, 1027px"/></noscript></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the right-hand side of the page, there is a detailed description of each step of the test, with its result. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s make the test fail by changing the ID of the login button into a value that will not be found on the page. Replace </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">driver.FindElementById(</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“login”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">).Click();</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">driver.FindElementById(</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“login-invalid”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">).Click();</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now when you rerun the test, it will show as failed and the statistics will be updated to include this test result:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-14589 size-full" title="TestProject Test Report_Failed Test" alt="TestProject Test Report_Failed Test" width="440" height="256" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_6.png"/></p>
<p><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-14589 size-full" title="TestProject Test Report_Failed Test" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_6.png" alt="TestProject Test Report_Failed Test" width="440" height="256"/></noscript></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-14590 size-full" title="TestProject Test Report_Failed Test" alt="TestProject Test Report_Failed Test" width="384" height="329" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_7.png"/></p>
<p><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-14590 size-full" title="TestProject Test Report_Failed Test" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pic_7.png" alt="TestProject Test Report_Failed Test" width="384" height="329"/></noscript></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, the report offers a lot of detail, and the failure message is a Selenium WebDriver exception – </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">NoSuchElementException</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now, we already know why this test failed, because we changed the ID intentionally, but in a real-life scenario, this information is very useful to help us understand what is causing the test to fail, and whether we need to make changes to our tests or the test identified a bug in the application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you know that the reports show the test output, you can change the value back to the correct one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want the report to provide more information, you can add screenshots. For this, you need to use the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TestReporter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">class, and then add a reporter step that will record the screenshot. The test will now look like this:</span></p>

            helper.Reporter.Step("Logged in the app", "The login is unsuccessful", "The login is successful", driver.FindElement(By.Id("logout")).Displayed, TakeScreenshotConditionType.Failure);
            //Verify that the login was successful 
            if (driver.FindElement(By.Id("logout")).Displayed)
            {
                return ExecutionResult.Passed;
            } 
            return ExecutionResult.Failed;            
                          
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new step will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">display the description (“Logged in the app”), </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">display a failure message (“The login is unsuccessful”) or a success message (“The login is successful”), </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">verify the condition (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">driver.FindElement(By.Id(</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“logout”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">)).Displayed), </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and take a screenshot if the condition is not met. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you run the test now, it will pass and display the success message, but no screenshot will be taken.</span></p>

<p>In February 2020, we were fortunate enough to have Erica Stanley present at the Applitools Days in Atlanta, GA. She spoke about virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality and gave some examples of next-generation mixed reality.</p>
<p>When you create new technology, you think “fail fast”. Why should an R&amp;D team prioritize quality?</p>
<p>In February 2020, we were fortunate enough to have Erica Stanley present at the Applitools Days in Atlanta, GA. Erica is a senior engineering manager on the Emerging Tech, Mixed Reality team at Mozilla. Within the Mixed Reality (MR) team, Erica’s team focuses on MR for desktop &amp; Android and has found a creative way to implement test automation with the help of Applitools, Cypress, OpenCV, and FFMPEG.</p>
<p>Writing this in the midst of the pandemic and looking back to February, so much has changed. Watching her presentation, I could not help but think of the potential such technology might have in a world of social distancing. Imagine being able to shop from home while interacting with the product. Or, you might attend a virtual reality meeting in a shared room with your colleagues. These are just a few examples that Erica talks about in her presentation.</p>
<p>Erica focuses on quality engineering on a team that focuses on innovation. If you think that quality engineering and innovation cannot coexist, Erica explains why they must work together, as well as how she helps her team use quality tools to aid in their innovation process.</p>
<h2 id="h-three-realities"><strong>Three Realities</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s begin with an overview of terminology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual Reality (VR) – A fully immersive experience where a user leaves the real-world environment behind to enter a fully digital environment via VR headsets.</li>
<li>Augmented Reality (AR) – An experience where virtual objects are superimposed onto the real-world environment via smartphones, tablets, heads-up displays, or AR glasses. (Think Pokemon Go game or the IKEA furniture app.)</li>
<li>Mixed Reality (MR) – A step beyond augmented reality where the virtual objects placed in the real world can be interacted with and respond as if they were real objects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h-four-interfaces"><strong>Four Interfaces</strong></h2>
<p>Next, Erica described the different kinds of virtual reality interface terms. If virtual reality provides an extension of human-machine interaction, let’s start at the earliest and move up.</p>
<ul>
<li>CLI – Command Line Interface – not necessarily what we think of as virtual reality, but still at the core of every computing system.</li>
<li>GUI – Graphical User Interface – graphical based, interactive, feedback. Whether using desktop monitors or virtual reality glasses, we still seem to use this interface today.</li>
<li>NUI – Natural User Interface – you don’t need instructions – it performs naturally. Erica gave the example of being a painter. Her experience of digital painting on the iPad – brush strokes, paint color mixing, etc. – seems natural from her experience as a painter.</li>
<li>OUI – Organic User Interface – Interface is almost seamless with your reality – the environment learns from you and changes with you.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>
<h2 id="h-examples-of-next-generation-mixed-reality"><strong>Examples of Next Generation Mixed Reality</strong></h2>
<p>Erica gave some interesting examples of potential real-world applications of mixed reality. These included entertainment, collaboration, and social engagement activities, where MR might provide unique value. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Immersive Movies – imagine walking around in a 3D environment and interacting with the movie? Would this mean being in a movie theater or being in the movie itself? What movie would you “drop” into? Or would it be more like a virtual Black Mirror: Bandersnatch – where you interact with the movie to determine the outcome?</li>
<li>Corporate Meetings – This would bring working from home to the next level – with everyone being “together” in a meeting room. There is nothing like being in-person, but to have a way to share a virtual whiteboard and be in the same virtual room could bring a new level of focus to remote meetings – I am looking forward to this application of MR.</li>
<li>Civic engagement – how about envisioning planning commission proposals in a real-world walk-around in your neighborhood? Or being able to share visualization of education data results during a school board meeting?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h-a-focus-on-quality-yes-even-for-research-product-delivery"><strong>A Focus on Quality: Yes – Even for Research Product Delivery</strong></h2>
<p>Some people think of quality as a cost of doing business. Those people think of quality as a way to reduce support and rework costs. If you share that mindset, you probably wonder how quality engineering fits into an R&amp;D lab.</p>
<p>As Erica explains, her team works with partners who are their customers. The partners expect working products just as any customer would. Her team also works with user communities who, in turn, build on top of her team’s code. Each iteration includes new features, enhancements, and bug fixes. Because of all the downstream dependencies, any bugs, misbehaviors, or unexpected behavior changes can cause those downstream teams’ huge issues. To remain a trusted supplier and partner in this R&amp;D world, Erica helped her team prioritize and deliver quality as a core component of the build process.</p>
<h2 id="h-quality-challenges-in-mixed-reality-applications"><strong>Quality challenges in Mixed Reality Applications?</strong></h2>
<p>Erica and her team knew to value quality for their ecosystem. The question remained: how would her team be able to deliver a quality product? What tools could help her team deploy and test a cutting-edge technology. She realized that she and her team needed to innovate with her solution. At the same time, she needed to import best-practices from across the software development practices.</p>
<p>So, what are some of the challenges that Erica’s team faced in testing mixed reality applications?</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of specialized software for virtual reality testing. Testers must build their own test approaches and test fixturing. So, few people are building AR/VR/MR yet alone running automated tests on such applications. Teams need to figure it out on their own.</li>
<li>Teams must design their tests to account for both 2D and 3D interactions.</li>
<li>Teams face an incredibly fragmented device market. Headsets, eyewear, and tactile interfaces have their own specifications and behavior. As in the early days of Android smartphones – everyone complies with and extends beyond the existing specification.</li>
</ul>
<p>With all these technical challenges, the biggest hurdle Erica and team faced was not technical. Her focus on quality ran headlong into the existing culture of ‘fail fast’. How did she convince research engineers to build in automated testing? It came down to convincing them that quality is a way to deepen and speed up the learning from the research itself.</p>
<p>Erica went on to discuss how she fostered a learning culture including psychological safety, implementation of standards, and deep collaboration between developers and the QA team.</p>
<h2 id="h-running-test-automation-on-mixed-reality"><strong>Running Test Automation on Mixed Reality</strong></h2>
<p>The team at Mozilla implemented an entire test automation suite for testing their code builds. A large component of that automation involves visual testing, delivered via Applitools. Some of the benefits they received by visual testing AR, VR and MR applications include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoiding manual testing without the headset. Getting a user into the headset takes time. With visual testing, you can test in the browser.</li>
<li>Visualization fosters collaboration between Developers and QA team. The team collaborates on what is correct in the baseline images and discuss changes as a team – a great way to speed up research learnings.</li>
<li>Addressing device fragmentation – you can turn on / off certain snapshots depending on the device under test helping you deal with all the devices in a concise manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the variety of scenarios require a variety of tools, the one consistent was Applitools. Below are the three scenarios that the team at Mozilla has implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>2D with Applitools &amp; Cypress – to test navigation, essentially, automating the testing of the chrome around the browser.</li>
<li>3D on Android with Applitools &amp; OpenCV – This combination helps their team understand where objects are in space. If an object includes another object – you can isolate the object and focus solely on the object under test.</li>
<li>360 Video with Applitools &amp; FFMPEG – This enables test frames in 360 video to be isolated visual validated.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h-what-s-next"><strong>What’s Next</strong></h2>
<p>Wrapping up, Erica spoke about what happens beyond visual interactions and how this can be tested. One of the challenges up next: How do you automate the test of a controller that is supposed to vibrate with an interaction or test for voice interactions?</p>
<p>AR, VR, and MR comprise a set of fast-evolving user experience technologies. Erica and her team sit among the lead group of quality engineers facing down the challenges that these technologies present.</p>

<p>Automated UI testing is a daily struggle for efficiency and reliability. A <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/blog/how-to-optimize-a-test-and-make-it-560-percent-faster" rel="noopener noreferrer">single misconfigured line of code</a> can cost teams in hours of lost feedback time and test error triaging—potentially costing companies hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>In this case study we will see how interactions with only two web elements led to a 34% degradation in the test execution time. Afterwards, we will learn how to remove this inefficiency by simply keeping our element location timeout to a maximum of 20 seconds on mobile devices.</p>
<h2>What Our Final Test Can Look Like</h2>
<p></p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/6PpLnTAMAosDXpfKLR8nSd/2ca1fb98e979892116cfa2548ae01161/Nikolay_img2.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay img2" title="Nikolay img2"/></p>
<p><i>Screenshot of the test metadata before optimizations</i></p>
<h2>Trying to Find Element 1</h2>
<p>In the screenshot below, we start looking for element 5015 at ~0:55.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/5WsOsB9y5mpDT7X1JJjqKw/51ca61331cc04b7f4e92b56cd00ba449/Nikolay_img3.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay img3" title="Nikolay img3"/></p>
<p>And the test continues to look for this element until 02:12, at which point the test decides to move on.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/69nfqvAHAeHzKu0zNmGjFi/baecca036f0950f4efd73e3449589354/Nikolay_img4.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay img4" title="Nikolay img4"/></p>
<h3>What Were These Commands Doing?</h3>
<p>Looking at the locator, screenshots, and video, it’s obvious that the test was waiting for a spinner to disappear. After a closer analysis, it’s clear that the spinner is gone and the mobile app is in a ready state by 1:00.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the test wastes 72 seconds waiting for a spinner to not reappear before proceeding with the next actions.</p>
<h3>Inefficiency Cost</h3>
<p><b>19%</b> = 72 / 377, trying to find a single element.</p>
<h3>What’s The Solution?</h3>
<p>First, simply decrease the amount of time that we wait for elements to disappear. 20 seconds per element on a mobile device is sufficient. If an app isn’t rendering in 20 seconds on a mobile device, we have a bigger problem. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f64a.png" alt="🙊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Second, the logic to wait for a spinner to disappear is actually incorrect. The test should wait while the spinner is visible. When the spinner disappears, at that point the test can proceed. As a result, the test will only wait as long as necessary for the spinner to go away. </p>
<h2>Trying to Find Element 2</h2>
<p>There is another inefficient pattern in this test that’s dealing with element 5033. At 2:23 the test locates this element.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/2m7qlXoXzl8FbzgXEfA8ZT/f917e4d9766cefa0f22aa5318a1d139e/Nikolay_img5.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay img5" title="Nikolay img5"/></p>
<p>After the test finds element 5033, it begins a cycle of calling the same three Selenium commands from 2:24.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/4pACCIA9d1etYxkmkMB3ll/3ca6f7a3dea6188a3bf8b231d62931a5/Nikolay_img6.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay img6" title="Nikolay img6"/></p>
<p>This cycle repeats until 3:40 (76 seconds total), at which point a screenshot is captured and then the test is stopped.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/67fyTh4RDTjNBYHexwXflm/61159695864f339c056af1685c8254b9/Nikolay_img7.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay img7" title="Nikolay img7"/></p>
<h3>What Were These Commands Doing?</h3>
<p>These commands were looking for some element that never appeared.</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>The extremely common issue here is that there is no reason to waste 76 seconds looking for a single element. This is simply too long. As mentioned previously, 20 seconds on a mobile device is sufficient for 99% of cases for a page to render.</p>
<h3>Inefficiency Cost</h3>
<p><b>15%</b> = 56/377, wasted on looking for a single element.</p>
<h3>What’s The Solution?</h3>
<p>The solution is the same as above: decrease the timeout to 20 seconds maximum. What benefit does the test get if it spends 56 more seconds looking for an element?</p>
<h2>Total Damage From Inefficiency</h2>
<p>128 seconds out of 377 (34%) are spent on trying to locate only two elements! What’s even scarier is that this pattern is almost certainly applied throughout the entire organization as a result of the framework, likely costing teams dozens of hours every single day as a result of overexaggerated timeout values.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is elegantly simple. Set a 20 second timeout for all your element locators on a mobile application. For the large majority of cases this will be more than plenty. If we find that this is not sufficient and we keep seeing false positives, then we can increase the timeout.</p>

<p><strong>Election 2020: Make Sure Your Voice is Heard with These Tips &amp; Best Practices</strong></p>
<p>Last year, India exercised one of the greatest feats of democracy, trying to enable over 900 million people to vote in their general election. My mom lives in India, and I remember talking with her about their ambitious plans to reach every voter, no matter how <a target="_blank" href="https://www.voanews.com/south-central-asia/poll-workers-trek-indias-most-remote-voters" rel="noopener noreferrer">remote their location</a>. They sent poll workers deep into the jungle, and across rivers, to reach just a handful of voters. The result: a record turnout at over 67%.</p>
<p>In the United States, we too have an opportunity to fulfill our civic duties, with various options available to us to make sure our votes are heard. While many people choosing to mail in their votes for the very first time, there’s also a lot of confusion around election rules and security, not to mention a flood of misinformation online to be wary of.</p>
<p>Here at McAfee, we want to help you vote with confidence in this critical election. That’s why we’ve put together a number of tools, resources, and best practices to empower voters. Our hope is that every voice can be heard.</p>
<p><strong>Demystifying Mail-In Voting</strong></p>
<p>Let’s start with some questions you may have around mail-in voting, since twice as many people plan to mail in their ballots this year, compared to 2016. Of course, with the COVID-19 pandemic still active, it’s understandable that many people, especially the vulnerable, would prefer to mail their ballot, rather than go to a polling station. I personally got my mail-in ballot and am ready to mail it this week. If you haven’t decided on how to vote, you still have time to decide.</p>
<p>To get accurate information on mail-in voting, go directly to your state and local websites for guidance, including how to fill out your ballot, and when to turn it in. Rules vary state to state, but one thing we do know is that mail-in voting has proven to be a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/election-security" rel="noopener noreferrer">reliable and secure way</a> to have your voice heard.</p>
<p>It’s great to see long lines to vote in some states already. If you are still concerned about election security and online scams, my colleague Judith Bitterli has written a great guide for locating reliable sources and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/2020-election-security/?hilite=%27elections%27" rel="noopener noreferrer">protecting your vote</a> (Key tip: always look for a .gov domain name).</p>
<p>She also has advice for making sure that your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/election-2020-five-tips-to-secure-a-mail-in-ballot-that-counts/" rel="noopener noreferrer">mail-in ballot counts</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Safe Election Surfing</strong></p>
<p>When looking online for election resources, be aware that scammers and cybercriminals are always trying to take advantage of trending topics to misdirect users to dangerous websites and links. In fact, the FBI <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fake-voting-websites-fbi-warning-2020-10?r=MX&amp;IR=T" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently warned</a> that bad actors have been setting up fake election websites, in an attempt to steal voters’ personal information, or get them to download dangerous files.</p>
<p>The Bureau suggests that you visit the U.S. Election Assistance Commission <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eac.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> for accurate information in a variety of languages. If you are concerned about clicking on risky links during the election or year-round, one smart action you can take is to install McAfee <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/safe-browser/mcafee-webadvisor.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAdvisor</a>, which warns you of risky sites before you click on them.</p>
<p>Although it can be tempting to believe election information posted on social media, especially by friends and family members, know that business school <a target="_blank" href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/mit-sloan-research-about-social-media-misinformation-and-elections" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT Sloan</a> says “fake news is at its peak” during online presidential years, and even your loved ones can be fooled.</p>
<p>But whether information is clickbait, or legitimate, it can still be posted to risky websites designed to steal your information, or download malware. That’s why McAfee released a new social media protection tool as part of WebAdvisor. Using color codes, the tool shows you which links are safe or risky right in your social feed, and can be used across all six major social media platforms. This makes it easier to avoid dangerous links posted on social channels. Given the increase in phishing we’ve observed in the last few months across PC and mobile platforms, a comprehensive security solution like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee® Total Protection</a> can help keep your personal information and devices safe.</p>
<p><strong>In-Person Voting</strong></p>
<p>If you still plan to vote in person, or even better, volunteer as a poll worker, make sure that you have reliable information on voting times and locations. You’ll probably also want to look into local rules on health and safety precautions, so you are well prepared.</p>
<p>False and misleading information about COVID 19 has been swirling since the start of the pandemic, so it’s important that you seek verified information about the virus. Here again are some great tips from Judith on how to keep <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/u-s-election-2020-dont-let-covid-19-misinformation-suppress-your-vote/?hilite=%27elections%27" rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID misinformation</a> from suppressing your vote.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Exercise Your Right</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know how to sidestep misinformation, find trusted resources, and plan your vote — either through the mail or in person— I hope that you will exercise your right, with confidence.</p>

<p>This year we were proud to be a Platinum <a target="_blank" href="https://2020.seleniumconf.in/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium Conference</a> 2020 sponsor, connecting and “meeting” with QA engineers, test automation experts, developers from all across the globe, all while learning from top leaders in today’s testing industry, such as: <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/author/tarun-narula/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tarun Narula</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/author/virender-pannugmail-com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virender Singh, </a><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/author/gaurav-singh55gmail-com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaurav Singh, </a><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/author/singhrajni2210gmail-com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rajni Singh, </a><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/author/kouldeepgmail-com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deepak Koul</a>, and many more! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>As opposed to the <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/09/30/testproject-seleniumconf-london-2019/" rel="noopener noreferrer">conference last year</a>, it was quite a different experience for everyone involved since the entire event transitioned into the virtual world, and we all know why… <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f637.png" alt="😷" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>So for those of you who might have missed it or didn’t have the budget to attend, don’t worry – we’ve got you covered by opening the stage to all the speakers to share their meaningful and effective sessions.</p>
