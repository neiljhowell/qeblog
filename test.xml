										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>In March 2019, an online intruder discovered that cloud storage used by financial giant Capital One suffered from a vulnerability in the firm&#8217;s application firewall and storage servers, allowing the attacker to send commands from one to the other.</p>
<p>The exploitation of the vulnerability—<a target="_blank" href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">an issue known as server-side request forgery (SSRF)</a>—resulted in the leaking of sensitive personal information on more than 106 million individuals in the United States and Canada. Capital One had misconfigured its web application firewall, failing to prevent privileged access to the company&#8217;s cloud storage server hosted on Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>This class of vulnerability was well understood and easy to exploit. It should have been a priority to fix. But the takeaway from this incident is how easy missing an important security flaw can be, said Frank Kim, instructor and curriculum lead at the SANS Institute, a technical training organization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Even Capital One, a leader in DevOps security, makes mistakes. There are so many vulnerabilities, and companies are trying to push out so much functionality. We need to be able to close the window of vulnerability more quickly.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/fykim" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Frank Kim</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most companies are doing <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/build-appsec-dev-tb/appsec-best-practices?lx=a0uQni&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">credible jobs of finding and fixing vulnerabilities in code</a>, ensuring deployed servers are not misconfigured, and putting defenses in place to protect networks and data. The problem, however, is that a single misconfiguration can have massive repercussions. SSRF, for example, is a well-understood class of vulnerabilities, but such attacks are hard to mitigate on cloud services, and protections did not exist a year ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;As we know about DevOps, it is not just the technology when we are talking about the vulnerabilities, it is the process and the technology. We can&#8217;t just throw all these tools at the DevOps teams, because even though we say developers should do more security, their incentives—getting functional code out as quickly as possible—have not changed.&#8221;<br />—Frank Kim</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In November, eight months after the breach, Amazon <a target="_blank" href="https://duo.com/decipher/aws-adds-new-protections-against-ssrf-other-web-app-attacks" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">implemented protections against such attacks</a>.</p>
<p>Massive breaches are often caused by simple vulnerabilities that developers, operations, and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/build-appsec-dev-tb/appsec-strategies?lx=a0uQni&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">application-security teams have missed</a>. Here are four lessons from major breaches on how to catch the next seemingly small software bug before it snowballs into a massive breach.</p>
<p><em>[ The shift is on to secure code. Get up to speed with <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/state-of-application-security-testing-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechBeacon&#8217;s State of App Sec Guide</a>. Plus: Get the <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/state-of-application-security-testing-tb/gartner-magic-quadrant-appsec-testing?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner 2020 Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing</a> ]</em></p>
<h3>1. Know your assets</h3>
<p>On March 6, 2017, the Apache Foundation released a patch for a vulnerability (<a target="_blank" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5638" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CVE-2017-5638</a>) in Apache Struts 2, which allows attackers to execute commands using a specially crafted header HTTP header. Four days later, attackers used the flaw to scan servers at credit-reporting agency Equifax, compromising a key server there. From May to July, attackers returned and stole sensitive financial information on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694158.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">more than 145 million American adults from the company</a>.</p>
<p>The cost of the Equifax breach to date: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/equifaxs-data-breach-costs-hit-14-billion-a-12473" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$1.4 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, Equifax knew about the vulnerability and had taken steps to patch the flaws across its systems. However, application-security experts have come up with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.databreachtoday.com/blogs/learn-from-how-others-get-breached-equifax-edition-p-2870" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a list of 29 failures</a> that led to the eventual breach. Perhaps the two most important ones: a lack of visibility into what assets and software the company had deployed, said Jim Manico, founder of Manicode Security and volunteer project leader at the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;All that Equifax had to do was apply the patch across their network, but on a couple of servers, either they missed them or they applied the patch and it broke, so they rolled it back&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/manicode" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jim Manico</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being able to determine what assets may be affected by a new vulnerability, and doing it at speed, has become increasingly important, he said. Attackers create exploits from the information they glean from patches much more quickly than they could just a decade ago. In 2006, the average time it took to exploit a known vulnerability was 45 days; in 2015, it was two weeks; and with the Apache Struts 2 flaw, it took three days, Manico said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The responsibility for patching has changed over the last 15 years as attackers have sped up their ability to go from a software patch to an exploit. For anyone running Struts 2, they had 72 hours to patch their systems. This is the No. 1 problem for application security, and developers continue to take it lackadaisically.&#8221;<br />—Jim Manico</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2. Maintain coverage of important classes of vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>The SSRF issue that led to the Capital One breach demonstrates the importance of attaining 100% coverage across both the codebase and deployed applications. While SSRF can be hard to patch in many cases, the class is relatively easy for attackers to find, according to Evan Johnson, manager of the product security team at CloudFlare. He wrote in <a target="_blank" href="https://ejj.io/blog/capital-one" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">an analysis of the Capital One breach</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;SSRF is a bug hunter&#8217;s dream because it is an easy to perform attacks and regularly yields critical findings. &#8230; The problem is common and well-known, but hard to prevent and does not have any mitigations built in to the AWS platform.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ejcx_" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Evan Johnson</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the OWASP Top-10 is a good start for a list of software vulnerability classes that need coverage, every development team has a different list. What is important is for the company to make sure it has good coverage—through tools and processes—of the vulnerability classes on the developers&#8217; list, said Dan Cornell, chief technology officer of Denim Group, an application-security consultancy.</p>
<p>While companies are trying to push more security checks into integrated development environments (IDEs), they should only &#8220;shift left&#8221; those tools that retain a high-level of coverage while not disrupting development, he said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;From a coverage standpoint, you can test for certain vulnerabilities at a certain level of quality, so there are certain types of checking that you can push left. But there are some things that take too much time to integrate into a pipeline—like full static analysis to find SQL injection issues—to move onto the developers&#8217; plates.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/danielcornell" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dan Cornell</a></p>

<h3>3. Teach security continuously</h3>
<p>Development teams usually do not have the incentive to prioritize security in their daily work. Instead, security tends to get in the way of implementing features and do so on deadline.</p>
<p>Security is a tax on developer productivity, but if done correctly, it only has to be an incremental one. Addressing issues early helps minimize the impact on the developer and the impact on the company, which could be very substantial, said Tim Mackey, principal security strategist with vulnerability-management firm Synopsys.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;When I&#8217;ve talked to organizations that had a data breach, they say they have had to spend 50% of the time following a breach, fixing the issues—we are talking about impacts of that magnitude. Developers need the continuous positive reinforcement in their IDE &#8230; where you can make them feel incremental pain and get them information in context so they do the right thing, because they may not know how.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/timintech" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tim Mackey</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Security requirements for developers should also be explicit and actionable, said Nidhi Shah, principal security researcher at Micro Focus. Application-security teams should conduct threat modeling, work with the development team to create the architecture for the product, and then turn those considerations into part of the specification, she says.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The developer should not have to translate architecture requirements into tasks during development. Security should instead be specified as part of the feature template that the developer needs to produce.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nidhi-shah-8046481/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Nidhi Shah</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>4. Strive to make patching painless</h3>
<p>The lowest level of application-security maturity is not patching, which should be unacceptable for any software development team. Companies whose application-security teams track open-source components, triage patches, and include coding feedback in the integrated development environment are above average, at Level 2.</p>
<p>Yet these scanners miss things.</p>
<p>The highest level of maturity for OWASP&#8217;s Manico is not depending on the scanners, but lowering the disruption of patching by automation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Attaining this level of maturity makes your security posture the best, but it also makes your functionality the most fragile, because you are changing every day. If you update every day, you need two things to go fast: one, rigorous security and functionality automation, and two, the willingness to fix dependencies in the open-source world.&#8221;<br />—Jim Manico</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet getting to the point where everything can be patched quickly and relatively painlessly may be out of reach for most development organizations, said Denim Group&#8217;s Cornell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It is easy to give the advice that you need to patch everything, but it is harder to follow at scale, and there are some systems which cannot suffer a disruption. When you patch a server and the Oracle database does not come up and you are losing thousands of dollars a minute, that will make you more hesitant to patch quickly.&#8221;<br />—Dan Cornell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the end, application-security teams need to recruit developers to their cause by making it easy to learn security and integrating security tools that do not get in the way of development.</p>
<p>We need to provide developers help, says Micro Focus&#8217;s Shah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If security is not part of the functional requirement, they are not going to implement it. Deciding whether we can upgrade, whether the vulnerability is applicable to our software—those are questions that often the developer is not able to determine.&#8221;<br />—Nidhi Shah</p>

<div>
<p>Enterprise service management (ESM) is ideal for streamlining and optimizing customer services that multiple teams and departments jointly provide in an organization. ESM initiatives in many businesses around the world are helping to increase customer satisfaction, control costs, and increase productivity.</p>
<p>ESM <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/extend-it-service-management?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">applies IT service management (ITSM) principles, practices, and tools to non-IT parts of the business</a>, such as human resources, finance, travel, and facilities. It requires a new way of thinking and working. That&#8217;s why teams that are willing to adapt and evolve are having the greatest success with it.</p>
<p>ESM is most effective when companies can do two things right:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify the true needs of their customers </strong>at the present time, not just what leaders think customers should need or what satisfied them in the past.</li>
<li><strong>Transcend the silos</strong> and find new ways to add more customer value, no matter who contributes what to the value stream.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fail at either of those, and your project will be in danger of becoming irrelevant, or paralyzed by bureaucratic and political roadblocks.</p>
<p>Here are the key issues that enterprise service management consultants and practitioners say threaten the success of ESM projects in organizations of many sizes—and tips on how to avoid or overcome them.</p>
<p><em>[ Learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/enterprise-service-management-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to optimize your Enterprise Service Management (ESM)</a>.

<h3>1. Trying to go it alone</h3>
<p>ESM tools can be complex to implement properly, and if your entire team is new to ESM, you can waste a lot of time, make a lot of rookie mistakes, and still end up with an implementation that is too limiting. Have the vendor help you install and configure a new ESM tool, said Doug Tedder, principal at Tedder Consulting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;[This] will keep you from the trap of making it too specific to what you’re trying to do right now.&#8221; <br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/dougtedder" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Doug Tedder</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will also keep you from stalling out the entire project. For example, one large public-school system in the US purchased a popular ESM tool but was left on its own during a very complicated implementation with multiple workflows. The experience was extremely frustrating, wasted a lot of time, and soured many employees on the whole project, said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/VesnaSoraic" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Vesna Soraic</a>, senior manager of product marketing at Micro Focus.</p>
<p>You can avoid that. When <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/buyers-guide-esm-products?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">evaluating ESM tool vendors</a>, be honest about your team&#8217;s limitations, said Tedder. Implementation mistakes can plague you for years, so it&#8217;s smart to get it right from the beginning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Make sure you ask about implementation assistance if your team lacks expertise.&#8221; <br />—Doug Tedder</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2. Thinking too small</h3>
<p>A limited vision of what ESM can do for your organization will lead to limited improvements that don&#8217;t take advantage of the full potential of ESM that executives will be expecting. Don&#8217;t think too small by focusing only on digitizing existing workloads, or automating a few parts of an existing workflow. <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/resources/techbeacon-guide-how-roll-out-robotic-process-automation" rel="noopener noreferrer">That&#8217;s really just automation</a>.</p>
<p>Think big, said Lou Hunnebeck, principal advisor at IT services provider DXC Technology, because that&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-roadmap?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">the digital transformation that executives are chasing</a> right now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;[It&#8217;s better to think about] doing something in a fundamentally different way, or doing something completely new.&#8221; <br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/louhunnebeck" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lou Hunnebeck</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>ESM, done right, can support <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-pandemic?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">true digital transformation</a> in both the back and front offices. It can help your organization deliver extraordinary value to customers by doing things in completely different ways (faster, cheaper, better than before), and offering new things that meet their needs better than ever (and better than the competition).</p>
<p>Companies are digitally transforming the way they serve and delight their customers, from the kiosks at McDonald&#8217;s that let toddlers customize their own Happy Meal to self-parking cars that take the stress out of parallel parking to Disney&#8217;s MagicBands that let guests into their hotel room and into the parks with a FastPass—and can tip them off about rides with short lines and alert Disney characters to wish them a happy birthday. <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-esm-must-evolve-automate-end-end-value-streams" rel="noopener noreferrer">This does not happen if you think small</a>.</p>

<h3>3. Trying to tackle too much in one project</h3>
<p>It is tempting to try to address an entire end-to-end process in one ESM project—especially if you&#8217;re thinking big in terms of impact. But unless you’re looking at a very simple process, you will almost certainly run into serious problems with that approach, said Hunnebeck.</p>
<p>First, you may produce a process flow mapped at too high a level. This is a problem because it leaves too many gaps. It&#8217;s hard to &#8220;find the gotchas, and identify opportunities for efficiencies,&#8221; in a high-level process map, because too many important details are missing, he said.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you may attempt to produce a highly detailed <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/whats-wrong-your-value-stream-mapping" rel="noopener noreferrer">value-stream map</a>, documenting every data point about the current state. When you are addressing a complex process that involves multiple teams and workflows, this usually takes too long, and can seldom be completed within the project timeline.</p>
<p>This commonly happens to teams that think they can analyze and document their processes once and that&#8217;s it, said Hunnebeck.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“That’s ridiculous. You don’t have to do things via waterfall; you should work iteratively.”<br />—Lou Hunnebeck</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you target an improvement, choose something that you think can be done in 30 to 90 days. If you have to break up big projects into small pieces, that&#8217;s fine. But if you extend any initiative much beyond that, you lose people’s focus, and organizational support may shift to other things, Hunnebeck said.</p>
<p>These short-term projects will help you take your organization through a staged approach to ESM adoption, where projects are able to evolve based on priorities, said Dennis Drogseth, vice president of research at consultancy Enterprise Management Associates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;[Don&#8217;t think in terms of] a single before and after, but a stepladder to where you&#8217;re trying to go.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/dndrogseth" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dennis Drogseth</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This iterative model is critical to keeping momentum going because it gets you to the finish line over and over. Find improvements the business will value, and that you &#8220;can solve to some degree of completeness in a matter of weeks,&#8221; said Tedder. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Show small, incremental value and continue to roll on that,&#8221; with a road map of projects that eventually result in holistic transformation.&#8221;<br />—Doug Tedder</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This approach produces multiple benefits. Once teams put an iterative improvement in place, they are able to quickly evaluate its performance and market its success throughout the organization, said Hunnebeck. Teams can use lessons learned on their subsequent projects, and help the organization realize the benefits of ESM in real time.</p>
<h3>4. Failing to think like a customer</h3>
<p>If you lose your connection <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/using-devops-app-agility-rethink-how-you-engage-customers" rel="noopener noreferrer">to your customers&#8217; current needs</a>, wants, and underlying pain points, you run the risk of expanding in the wrong directions, missing emerging opportunities, and failing to see major shifts in the market that change the game. In other words, you become more Blockbuster and less Netflix.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental prerequisites of any ESM implementation is to have a clear understanding of who the customer is and what&#8217;s important to them. This is the case whether you are providing services to your external customers or to employees.</p>
<p>As a service provider, you need to look at your consumers from the perspective of what they need, what is important to them, and what their desired outcomes are, said DXC&#8217;s Hunnebeck.</p>
<p>With this approach, you become laser-focused on the needs of your customers, and this can in turn <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-infuse-customer-feedback-your-devops" rel="noopener noreferrer">drive customer-centric innovation</a> that delivers more value every year. This is a key component of the success of Amazon, whose mission statement begins with: &#8220;Earth’s most customer-centric company.&#8221;</p>
<p>A deep understanding of a customer pain point or need gives you a good point of departure for ESM. You start with a clearly defined, highly relevant business problem, and then &#8220;imagine how a combination of technology and process and services all might come to bear to solve the issue,&#8221; Tedder said.</p>
<h3>5. Leaving out important voices</h3>
<p>You&#8217;re more likely to make poor decisions if you don&#8217;t involve all the people who know important things about the process you are trying to improve. A classic mistake is inviting only managers to participate. Managers frequently don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happening in a process or workflow. They assume that a procedure that&#8217;s been defined and documented is being followed precisely.</p>
<p>But if you get input from people on the factory floor, said Hunnebeck, they often say, &#8220;Oh no, we don&#8217;t really do it that way. What we really do is XYZ. And by the way, if you don&#8217;t do Z in a particular way, it falls apart.&#8221; </p>
<p>Pulling in the right voices is also an iterative process. You start with a few people with broad knowledge of the value stream, and &#8220;then you expand and add more and more stakeholders who know things that you didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>When you are trying to improve something on a detailed level, it is essential to listen to all those extra voices and resist making any assumptions. All too often, people assume too much and &#8220;it blows up in their faces,&#8221; said Hunnebeck.</p>
<h4>How to solicit the correct input</h4>
<p>When you are working with a cross-functional process, or a value stream with multiple sub-processes, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify all the stakeholders (upstream and downstream)</li>
<li>Identify all the contributors and their roles in the value stream</li>
<li>Get all the right people to provide input when it&#8217;s going to do you the most good</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, said Hunnebeck, when you identify a proposed improvement, you need to give all the stakeholders across the value stream the chance to say, &#8220;If you change that part of the process, it will have a negative effect downstream,&#8221; or, &#8220;We need to provide you with new inputs from upstream to enable that automation.&#8221; </p>
<p>To succeed you need a mix of executive leadership, process, and political alignment, and strong mid-level management, said Drogseth. You will also need people who can architect, DevOps people, and analytics experts. </p>
<p>All of these perspectives will provide specific kinds of value to the project, and can challenge and correct any faulty assumptions that individual team members might make.</p>
<p>By not working iteratively, not involving the right voices, and making too many assumptions, people will struggle to automate process. Mistakes happen when teams try to skip some of these best practices and rush toward the finish line.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It’s not rocket science, but there aren’t any shortcuts.&#8221;<br />—Lou Hunnebeck</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>6. Neglecting to sponsor and own the project properly</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s a common mistake to think that your ESM project can be a part-time activity for everyone involved. Most contributors will need to participate as they continue to doing their regular jobs. But you <em>will</em> need a full-time commitment from one or two people—designated as the project owners—to shepherd it to completion, Hunnebeck said.</p>
<p>This will be possible only if you have the right level of corporate sponsorship for your ESM initiatives. Helpiing the C-suite to get their heads around this &#8220;is critical,&#8221; said Tedder. If you have someone in the top management owning ESM for the entire organization, that person will have sufficient authority to mandate the cooperation of all departments, teams, and individuals that will need to contribute something to the project.</p>
<p>And that includes excusing someone from their day job to own the ESM project.</p>
<p>Realistically, you can&#8217;t run an ESM project without a full-time owner and expect to deliver results on time. The role requires tremendous amounts of coordination and communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be a side job if you want to keep this going.&#8221;<br />—Lou Hunnebeck</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>How a project manager gets it done</h4>
<p>An ESM project owner typically proceeds like this.</p>
<p>First, identify the high-level flow, as a point of departure for the project team. &#8220;You don’t want to start with a blank page,&#8221; said Hunnebeck. Next, identify the obvious people who should have a broad knowledge of the value stream, and invite them to participate.</p>
<p>Third, schedule and facilitate a preliminary on-site workshop for a couple of days to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scope out the end-to-end flow as far as possible (low-tech approaches can be very effective here; think sticky notes and flip charts).</li>
<li>Share metrics from each participant that are relevant to their pieces of the value stream.</li>
<li>Build the larger list of other people who need to provide input.</li>
<li>Create a clear go-forward plan with specific details.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rarely will every person be needed at the in-person meeting, said Hunnebeck. But the in-person meeting is incredibly valuable to get everyone engaged and drive a sense of ownership.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It also sends a powerful message from the business: We are serious and we’re willing to spend money on this.&#8221;<br />—Lou Hunnebeck</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the workshop, engage all the potential participants, clearly explaining what contribution you expect from people with deep knowledge about big sections of the process—including the amount of time you will need from them, the kinds of things you&#8217;ll need them to do, and their overall responsibilities.</p>
<p>Next, invite technical resources who are experts in specific tools or other parts of the process to participate. You will need to work with their managers to get support for the time they&#8217;ll spend on this.</p>
<p>You will also want to ensure that they will be recognized and rewarded for their participation. &#8220;If they feel like their boss doesn&#8217;t support it, or they don&#8217;t have time to contribute to it and won&#8217;t be recognized for it, you&#8217;re already dead in the water,&#8221; said Hunnebeck.</p>
<p>After the first workshop, set up a regular cadence of meetings that makes sense for your team. </p>
<p>Other tasks the point person will need to do include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manage the overall project.</li>
<li>At every opportunity, involve key stakeholders (including those outside the project team) to get their input, validate assumptions, and check for unknown ramifications.</li>
<li>Train and educate all participants.</li>
<li>Communicate progress with organization.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Failing to communicate enough</h3>
<p>Too often, employees hear about an ESM initiative in an all-hands meeting and then never hear about it again. That is a huge mistake. ESM requires culture change across the entire organization, so people need to understand and embrace it. When ESM owners fail to communicate, they miss an opportunity to educate, engage, and involve everyone in the process of digital transformation.</p>
<p>If you want support, be sure to communicate. Ask stakeholders for advice about issues you are grappling with; regularly let employees know what you&#8217;re up to, and why it matters. Ask for reality checks from people in the trenches who may feel marginalized.</p>
<p>Your executive sponsor will be essential here. When you want to recognize and commend people for their contribution, have that come from the sponsor, said Hunnebeck. Have them sign all the key memos and employee updates, and show their enthusiasm for the project.</p>
<p>All of this will reinforce the message that the company is serious about this, that &#8220;we intend to succeed, and we are making progress,&#8221; said Hunnebeck.</p>
<h3>Create principles to keep you on track</h3>
<p>Formulate a set of guiding values that can help guide your team when tough choices need to be made. This can be part of your agenda for the two-day workshop. For example, Hunnebeck&#8217;s clients often include things like: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on value</strong>: Make improvements that will make a difference.</li>
<li><strong>Start where you are</strong>: Don&#8217;t try to rip everything out and start over.</li>
<li><strong>Work iteratively, with feedback loops: </strong>We changed something; did it change anything material? Was is impactful?</li>
<li><strong>Collaborate and promote visibility:</strong> Don&#8217;t end up with two or three people doing everything themselves. Communicate news and kudos specifically, generously, and often.</li>
<li><strong>Think and work holistically: </strong>Think end to end—what are the ramifications of every change?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Now get rolling</h3>
<p>The main problems that commonly derail ESM projects are totally preventable. You can set yourself up for success by avoiding the seven deadly sins above, and by working to create an organizational culture that fosters innovative problem solving and celebrates the customer.</p>
<p>To get rolling in the right direction, think about processes that might need improvement, then <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/how-to-get-started-w?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">select an ESM project that is suitable for your organization</a>. Then you&#8217;re ready to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/buyers-guide-esm-products?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">evaluate the ESM tools and technologies </a>that might fit your needs.</p>
<p>You have everything to gain by leaning into ESM, and by being smart, persistent, and strategic about how you implement it. Start now, don&#8217;t take any shortcuts, and before long your company might join the likes of McDonald&#8217;s, Netflix, and Disney as you transform the way you deliver customer value and change the game.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />

<div>
<p><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium</a></strong> is a great tool, without a doubt. The real value of tests written in Selenium can be harvested only based on the test results it publishes. We have ‘n’ number of reporting tools &amp; frameworks for Selenium as such. But the common underlying issues with any of these reporting tools are they are mostly <em><strong>OFFLINE</strong></em>, which means the test results are published only after the test execution.</p>
<p>Let’s assume a business case for this solution. We have 1000 <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/03/07/what-test-cases-should-you-automate/" rel="noopener noreferrer">automated test cases</a> getting executed in the build pipeline. The status of the tests is published only after the test execution completes. What if there is a series of tests failing among the 1000 tests because of the same issue in the AUT? As it is probably a headless or remote execution, we will not be able to see it and to the extent, we will need to see build logs. And we all know monitoring logs manually is a big headache for testers! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f915.png" alt="🤕" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Welcome to the World of Test Monitoring!</strong></p>
<p>In this article, we are going to learn about how to get the results of our Selenium tests <em><strong>LIVE</strong></em> using <a target="_blank" href="https://grafana.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grafana</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.influxdata.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">InfluxDB</a>. Let’s get started!<strong> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4ca.png" alt="📊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f449.png" alt="👉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>

<ol>
<li>This article is written for macOS. So please refer to Grafana and InfluxDB sites for the Windows version of the installation.</li>
<li>There are of course additional open source and free platforms such as <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a> that have built-in <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/beautiful-test-analytics/" rel="noopener noreferrer">detailed reports and dashboards</a> for your Selenium and Appium tests. You can execute tests and get your reports right away, get Slack and email notifications, download full reports, and also easily integrate this flow within your build pipeline utilizing their <a target="_blank" href="https://api.testproject.io/docs/v2/" rel="noopener noreferrer">extensive API</a>.</li>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.influxdata.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>InfluxDB</em></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is an open-source time-series database (TSDB) developed by InfluxData.</span></p>

<p>Now, type the query to create a database:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="shell">create database selenium_test_results;</pre>

<p>To update the results to the <strong><em>InfluxDB</em></strong>, we need to create a class for connection like below:</p>

<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="conclusion" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>This is how we make the Selenium Test Results Live, using Grafana and InfluxDB! This is just one of the many methods out there for test monitoring and reporting, which is a crucial process for our automation testing. Therefore, in my next article, I will be discussing another tool, this time the free test automation platform <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a>, and see how we can leverage their extensive test reports and dashboards without having to use any other external tools, just TestProject.</p>
<p>You can find all the code from this article <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/grajk88/grafana-selenium-integration-tests" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Happy Reporting!</strong> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f60e.png" alt="😎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>What is the value of your cloud security investment?</p>
<p>How does your cloud security measure up with industry peers?</p>
<p>Amongst <em>all</em> the cloud security measures available, where should you get started?</p>
<p>Do you think nothing short of a magic will help answer these questions? If you answered <a target="_blank" href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/2292493/E8934E5272A4F9D09F3139685DFDE5D4/950953?partnerref=Blog" rel="noopener noreferrer">YES!</a> to any of the above questions, read on.</p>
<h2>
<strong>Cloud Adoption is Mainstream!</strong></h2>
<p>Cloud computing has evolved from being a market disruptor to the expected approach for IT. Today, businesses are evolving from being “cloud-first” to “cloud-only” According to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/lp/cloud-adoption-risk-report-business-growth-edition.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee Cloud Adoption and Risk Report 2019,</a> 87% enterprises said they experienced benefits from the cloud that helped drive business acceleration.</p>
<h2><strong>Need for Cloud Security Solutions is Paramount</strong><strong>!</strong></h2>
<p>With businesses moving more sensitive data into the cloud, the need for cloud security solutions is paramount. Consider this – the average cost of a data breach for the US is $8.19 million<sup>1</sup>! The cost of loss of reputation, non-compliance or credibility is immense. Businesses recognize this truth and the need for cloud security as part of their cloud adoption journey.  As organizations adopt new infrastructure and software, cloud security spending is continuing to increase. By 2023, spending on global cloud security solutions is expected to reach $12.7 billion, according to the Forrester Analytics: Cloud Security Solutions Forecast, 2018 To 2023 (Global) report.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>So, does IT really need a magical mirror to help answer foundational questions like measuring the value of their cloud security spending?</p>
<p>McAfee MVISION Cloud, a leading Cloud Access Security Broker that provides comprehensive visibility and control across enterprise SaaS, PaaS, and Infrastructure as a Service environments, and the MVISION Cloud Security Advisor (CSA) might just have the answer!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Those of us working in service management, and throughout IT, not only spend time and effort resolving incidents, but also helping address users&#8217; underlying tech problems. Much of this is a consequence of a bigger problem: the time constraints of <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/optimize-it-service?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">modern IT support</a>. And, as is often the case, problems lead to more problems.</p>
<p>Improving problem management processes and juggling incident management require striking a balance between the two. It&#8217;s not too challenging to tackle once you make the decision to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-ku-transformed-its-health-system-lean-it-service-management" rel="noopener noreferrer">start fixing the problems facing the service desk</a> head on.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re already working to capacity with daily responsibilities. Setting up and maintaining problem management can, therefore, quickly become a mundane job rather than a top-level priority. However, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/has-devops-morphed-itsm" rel="noopener noreferrer">taking an agile attitude</a> and being open to working both reactively and proactively can streamline the process. Here&#8217;s how.</p>
<p><em>[ Learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/enterprise-service-management-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to optimize your Enterprise Service Management (ESM)</a>. Plus: Get TechBeacon&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/buyers-guide-esm-products?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buyers Guide to ESM Products</a> ]</em></p>
<h3>1. Separate incidents from problems</h3>
<p>While it might seem counterproductive, the most crucial step is to separate single incidents from larger problems. Log these in their own dedicated spaces.</p>
<p>Doing so allows for clarity and transparency of the problem&#8217;s details, creates an accessible record during any investigations, and provides insight into the resources needed to fix all incidents. Additionally, this eliminates the temptation of storing everything in a single hold-all space that is typically used as a one-stop shop when dealing with a call.</p>
<h3>2. Create a known-error database</h3>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve identified each problem&#8217;s root cause, track these in a known-error database. Much as with incidents, keep known errors in a separate area from problems. The reason behind this is simply to allow the service desk to become more dynamic in its categorizations.</p>
<p>In the event that you must re-categorize an error to something more suitable post-investigation, you can. Now, as you discover problems, the <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/it-service-management-tb/itsm-tools-practices?lx=-rqtPA&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">service management solution </a>can provide an up-to-date record of shifts in your thinking and priorities. The known-error database then becomes an accessible, comprehensive archive of all problems discovered, as well as their workarounds for your team&#8217;s future use.</p>

<h3>3. Understand the 5 whys</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/optimize-it-service?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">Challenging the service desk&#8217;s methodology</a> helps continuously provide your team with a different perspective on daily challenges and helps identify new root causes of problems. By eliminating some of the more intensive methods for identifying problems at their core, you&#8217;re able to simplify your conflict digging.</p>
<p>An effortless way of doing so is through the &#8220;five whys&#8221; approach.</p>
<p>When adopting the five whys, you throw out complexity and return to a toddler-like approach to problem solving, asking, &#8220;Why?&#8221; &#8220;Why?&#8221; &#8220;Why?&#8221; Rather than deriving a foundational conclusion, you’re encouraged to ask even more about why something may be the way it is, asking a series of questions until arriving at the root cause. Continuing to ask why something is happening is key; typically, five whys is the magic number.</p>
<h3>4. Assign a problem manager role</h3>
<p>Assigning a member of the team or hiring someone for the position who is responsible for problem management helps improve the service desk&#8217;s entire process set. Naming an individual to help support solving problems can motivate the team in the direction of the same goal.</p>
<p>These same individuals gain—through the course of their work—the insight needed to monitor and analyze trends to better address problem management. The problem manager helps maintain momentum for the team and supports your ability to create a better internal organization for problem solving, which helps users.</p>
<h3>5. Share knowledge</h3>
<p>When it comes to problem solving, perhaps nothing is better than team collaboration. Invite the team to contribute to problem management; this adds variety to their daily roles and helps identify root causes more quickly if you have colleagues who are motivated.</p>
<p>Using the team&#8217;s knowledge also <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/customer-experience-what-counts-today-how-good-itsm-helps" rel="noopener noreferrer">helps embed cultural change</a> throughout your organization, which ultimately means better problem management for users&#8217; reported issues. </p>
<h3>A balancing act</h3>
<p>Improving problem management while also juggling incident management means striking a balance between the two. Setting up and maintaining problem management can quickly be addressed when you implement the processes for doing so simply and straightforwardly.</p>
<p>The results of doing so are well worth the effort, and your organization will reap the rewards of reduced incident impact, increased staff efficiency, and, ultimately, happier customers.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">As human beings, we</span><span data-contrast="none"> like to keep </span><span data-contrast="none">things simple</span><span data-contrast="none"> — which isn’t </span><span data-contrast="none">always</span><span data-contrast="none"> a bad thing.</span><span data-contrast="none"> However, it’s not ideal when it comes to password security.</span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">A</span><span data-contrast="auto">ccording to </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.techtimes.com/articles/246511/20191216/heres-the-most-common-passwords-you-avoid-using-and-how-google-chrome-helps-your-password-get-secured.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Tech Times</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, a recent</span><span data-contrast="auto"> worldwide</span><span data-contrast="auto"> survey conducted by the </span><a target="_blank" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/22/uk/most-common-passwords-scli-gbr-intl/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">United Kingdom’</span><span data-contrast="none">s National Cyber Security Centre</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">on</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the most common passwords </span><span data-contrast="auto">revealed that </span><span data-contrast="auto">23.2 million people </span><span data-contrast="auto">still </span><span data-contrast="auto">have</span><span data-contrast="auto"> passwords mentioning the classic ‘123456’ and</span><span data-contrast="auto"> that</span><span data-contrast="auto"> ‘123456789’ </span><span data-contrast="auto">is</span><span data-contrast="auto"> used by 7.7 million people worldwide</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Aside from common character sequences, many people</span><span data-contrast="auto"> (including my wife)</span><span data-contrast="auto"> also use significant dates</span><span data-contrast="auto"> or names of their loved ones as passwords. </span><span data-contrast="auto">According to another recent </span><a target="_blank" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/documents/PasswordCheckup-HarrisPoll-InfographicFINAL.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">study conducted by The Harris Poll</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> in partnership with Google, </span><span data-contrast="auto">nearly 60% of people studied said their birthday has been integrated into at least one password, 33% use a pet’s name, and 22% use their own name.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Other common habits also include reusing the same password across multiple accounts, writing them down on a piece of paper, keeping them in a file on their computer, or keeping them in a file on Dropbox or a similar platform. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">These shortcuts are understandable, as it can be challenging to recall so many complex passwords.
