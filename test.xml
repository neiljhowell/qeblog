										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">Not everyone was grumpy this spring after several weeks on lockdown. In fact, some developers were quite happy. What did the happy ones have in common? As it turns out, many of them engage in several common best DevSecOps practices, according to this year&#8217;s DevSecOps Community Survey.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also, it turns out that <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/devsecops-survey-you-need-happy-developers-build-secure-software" rel="noopener noreferrer">happy developers are found in mature DevSecOps practices</a>. And this matters, a lot, said Derek Weeks, co-founder of All Day DevOps and vice president at Sonatype, the survey&#8217;s sponsor</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Last year, the survey drew clear distinctions between elite DevSecOps practices and immature practices. This year our focus expanded into employee engagement and satisfaction, and its impact on software security.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/weekstweets" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Derek Weeks</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Here are three best practices from the front lines of DevSecOps.</p>
<p><em>[ Continuous delivery and release automation (CDRA) demands speed and quality. Find out how in <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechBeacon&#8217;s guide to CDRA</a>. Plus: Get the <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb/forrester-wave-cdra-q418?lx=-DC2cJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forrester Wave on CDRA</a>.  ]</em></p>
<h3>Engaged developers are happiest—and build more securely</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sonatype.com/2020survey" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">This year&#8217;s DevOps Community Survey</a>, the seventh annual, brought happiness into focus, demonstrating that happy developers are more engaged at work. Some 92% of developers in mature DevOps practices agreed with the statement &#8220;I am satisfied with my job,&#8221; a rate 1.5 times more than survey participants in less mature practices.</p>
<p>For years, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/2019-accelerate-state-devops-report-how-elites-drive-high-performance" rel="noopener noreferrer">DORA’s State of DevOps Report</a> has shown similar findings, where DevOps practitioners are most satisfied with their jobs and their businesses are more successful.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Outside of DevOps transformations, it has long been known that workplaces with high numbers of happy, engaged employees are the most successful. A 2019 Gallup survey shows that companies with engaged employees are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/267512/development-culture-engagement-paper-2019.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">21% more profitable</a> than their counterparts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Happiness affects security, too. According to the survey, happy developers are 3.6 times more likely to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/4-steps-transforming-developers-security-people" rel="noopener noreferrer">pay attention to security</a>. Those who <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/devs-are-key-app-sec-make-training-priority" rel="noopener noreferrer">receive security training</a> are 5 times more likely to enjoy their work.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mature practices are 3.8 times less likely to rely on a rumor when it comes to security incidents. Instead, these happy developers focus on empirical evidence from better-integrated tooling and from security teams.</p>
<h3>Best practices of happy developers</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The 2020 survey shares many insights into <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/state-devsecops-5-best-practices-front-lines" rel="noopener noreferrer">DevSecOps practices, training, and culture</a>, but here are some specific best practices companies can take to increase developer happiness.</p>
<h4>Build a security champions team </h4>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Happy developers work in places with more mature DevSecOps practices. So actively participate in the transformation, because ultimately it will make your day-to-day work more efficient and enjoyable. As the folks at the <em>Harvard Business Review</em> remind us, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://hbr.org/2017/12/to-get-people-to-change-make-change-easy" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">to get people to change, make change easier</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>To <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/you-need-security-champions-6-steps-get-program" rel="noopener noreferrer">create a champion program</a>, nominate one person from each team. Invite everyone, but have these members be the champions for learning security. Host it once a month and supplement it with security training sessions.</p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">You may find that the team produces more, and does so more effectively, if you keep the gatherings informal. Resist the urge to label roles or reinforce hierarchy, and see what happens. People are likely to surprise you, in a good way.<br /> </p>
<h4>Invest in automated tooling</h4>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/how-automation-can-boost-your-security-compliance" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automation helps you produce more secure software</a>, faster. The DevSecOps Community Survey showed that mature DevOps teams integrate automated security tools almost twice as often (1.8 times) as immature development teams.</p>
<p>A simple way to introduce automation is by using browser tools that put information right where you need it.</p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Experiment with automation tools. It may take a few tries to find the ones that work best for your particular project or style of working. Some tools may have learning curves, so be patient. When you find the right tools and come to trust them, they reduce your workload and your stress levels. <br /> </p>
<h4>Communicate calmly and with candor</h4>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Building secure software isn&#8217;t just about finding the right coding language. It&#8217;s also about <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-put-chatops-work-your-devops-team" rel="noopener noreferrer">refining and improving your communication skills</a>, in all the languages you speak.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Team dynamics are the basis of a good work culture. Be sure to consider how communication can enhance a workplace experience and improve workplace outcomes.</p>
<p>Stick to the basics: Be prompt, be professional, and be considerate. Everyone has a lot to manage these days, so an extra dose of kindness never hurts, either. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>As a quality engineer, what do you think about when you consider the return on investing an hour of your time? Or two hours? What if it could save you up to half the work hours you spent over the past year?</p>
<p>If you spend a lot of time writing or maintaining your end-to-end tests, our data shows that you’ll find lots of savings. What would you do with that time?</p>
<p>I have written previously about our <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/impact-of-visual-ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of Visual AI on Test Automation</a> report. And, I have written about the benefits that many of your peers discovered by using Applitools Visual AI. They <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/create-new-tests-much-faster/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reduced the number of lines of code they had to write</a>. Their <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/test-code-efficiency/" rel="noopener noreferrer">code became more stable </a>and <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/exit-the-test-maintenance-road-to-nowhere-through-visual-ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer">easier to maintain</a>. They <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/catch-more-bugs/" rel="noopener noreferrer">caught more bugs with less code</a>. And they learned how to do all this in about one to two hours.</p>
<p>So, what can an hour or two of your time give you?</p>
<h2 id="h.ghopl7fhjj7e">ROI For A Quality Engineer Hour</h2>
<p>Business people like me often talk about return on investment (ROI). If we invest this money today, what does the future payoff look like, and when does it come?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center"></p>
<p>ROI offers a good model for thinking for everyone. Including a decision about how to spend your time to learn a new skill. If you spend an hour learning something now, what is the future benefit to you, and when do you get it?</p>
<p>The ROI of a quality engineer hour might be measured by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing the number of test cases you can run</li>
<li>Increasing the number of bugs you can uncover</li>
<li>Decreasing the amount of low-value code you write.</li>
<li>Decreasing your code maintenance effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you’re going to invest one or two hours into learning a new technology, like, say, Visual AI, you would like to see many hours worth of return on your time.</p>
<p>Visual AI frees you from writing inspection code in your end-to-end tests. Inspection code has the highest chance to contain errors, gets written selectively to provide limited coverage, and still can require a high degree of coding skill.  </p>
<p>You might think that your value as a software engineer comes from your coding skills, and that often devolves into the inane measure of the value of a software engineer by counting lines of code written. Truthfully, not all code has the same value. In fact, code in of itself has zero value. It’s what that code does to help you test more conditions that matters.</p>
<h2 id="h.g4us53hqt2en">High-Value Code And Low-Value Code</h2>
<p>Your end-to-end tests contain both high-value code and low-value code.  </p>
<p>The high-value code exercises your application. It sets the test cases. It runs execution variations. The high-value code correlates to source code and UI test coverage.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ilya-pavlov-OqtafYT5kTw-unsplash-1.jpg" alt="ilya pavlov OqtafYT5kTw unsplash 1" class="wp-image-19426" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ilya-pavlov-OqtafYT5kTw-unsplash-1.jpg 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ilya-pavlov-OqtafYT5kTw-unsplash-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ilya-pavlov-OqtafYT5kTw-unsplash-1-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ilya-pavlov-OqtafYT5kTw-unsplash-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ilya-pavlov-OqtafYT5kTw-unsplash-1-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ilya-pavlov-OqtafYT5kTw-unsplash-1-555x370.jpg 555w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/><figcaption>Photo by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://unsplash.com/@ilyapavlov?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Ilya Pavlov</a> on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/html-code?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The low-value code inspects your results. And, if you’re using state-of-the-art coding, you’re inspecting the DOM for output web elements. Some you find with an ID. Others you find with a CSS selector. Some you find with a relative Xpath expression. Sometimes this code can involve incredible complexity. For example, writing all the assertions for reordering a table can involve elegant coding skills. And, yet…</p>
<p>If you review your end-to-end tests, much of your code determines whether the DOM contains the proper elements to let you conclude that the app passed. And, you have become good at triage. You cannot cover the state of every element in the DOM, so you become great at selecting code to inspect that tells you if your test passed or failed. Still, you write a lot of inspection code compared to execution code – and you only inspect a selected subset of the DOM.</p>
<p>But, the time you take writing this low-value code detracts from some of the high-value activity you can add to your end-to-end tests. For instance – you can write the preconditions for each test to ensure that they can be run independently – and, thus, in parallel. You can review the test conditions evaluated by each test to eliminate redundancy and improve automation accuracy.</p>
<p>What about maintenance? We didn’t even include code maintenance efforts you undertake between releases. That is yet more end-to-end coding effort you need – to validate and update existing tests, add new tests, and resolve failures – every time you modify the application. And, yes, some of that code provides new or modified test conditions. As well, some of that code needs to modify your inspection code.</p>
<h2 id="h.ag620l9hruwl">Visual AI Replaces Low-Value Code</h2>
<p>When we developed Visual AI, we recognized that a quality engineer makes trade offs. One engineer can only write a finite number of lines of code. An incomplete test has no value. So, every line of code needed to execute a test and validate the results makes a complete test.</p>
<p>We also recognized the limitations of DOM inspection for test results validation. Inspected thoroughly, the DOM represents the elements of the page to be rendered by the browser. And, one can write a detailed DOM inspection – and even account for variations in the DOM structure between releases. However, that depth of inspection involves complexity that rarely pays off for the coder. So, most coders spot-check their DOM – and can miss unexpected changes between releases unless validating the application through manual testing.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/root-cause-flow.png" alt="root cause flow" class="wp-image-19424" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/root-cause-flow.png 826w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/root-cause-flow-300x90.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/root-cause-flow-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 826px) 100vw, 826px"/></figure>
<p>Visual AI uses one line of code to capture every visual element on your web page – and the state of the DOM that created the page. Once captured, Visual AI compares your captured version to your baseline. Then, Visual AI highlights for you the real user-noticeable differences between the baseline and the new capture. From there, you choose to accept the changes as expected new features or reject them as bugs. And, you can link those differences directly to the DOM code used to generate those differences.</p>
<p>Since inspection statements make up the bulk of your end-to-end test code, by adding Visual AI, you can eliminate the bulk of your inspection statements – letting you write code faster, making your code more stable, and allowing you more time to work on high-value test automation tasks.</p>
<h2 id="h.mw68rurcqeh5">How Long Does It Take To Learn Visual AI?</h2>
<p>When we started the Applitools Visual AI Rockstar Hackathon, we directed participants to two courses on <a target="_blank" href="https://testautomationu.applitools.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Test Automation University (TAU)</a>. TAU, offered exclusively by Applitools, offers classes on a range of technologies, including:</p>
<p>We pointed participants to one course written by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajaraodv" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raja Rao</a> describing how to <a target="_blank" href="https://testautomationu.applitools.com/modern-functional-testing/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">modernize your functional tests with Visual AI</a>. Raja walked through the different test cases on the Hackathon in about an hour. We also pointed participants to a course by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angiejones" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angie Jones</a> on how to <a target="_blank" href="https://testautomationu.applitools.com/automated-visual-testing-a-fast-path-to-test-automation-success/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">add Visual AI to your test automation</a>.  Each course took approximately an hour.</p>
<p>Hackathon participants got pretty amazing results. After an hour or two of classes, they applied their knowledge of Visual AI and found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average test coverage jumped from 65% for coded inspection to 95% for Visual AI</li>
<li>Test writing time, on average, dropped from a little over 7 hours to a little over 1 hour.</li>
<li>The amount of code they wrote dropped significantly</li>
</ul>
<p>So, for one or two hours of learning, Hackathon participants got faster test writing, more coverage, and less code.</p>
<h2 id="h.2byhyeltva26">Testing Visual AI Yourself</h2>
<p>In the end, testing is a scientific activity. We run a series of tests and make observations – pass or fail.</p>
<p>In this blog, you’re reading a bunch of claims about Visual AI. These are based on data that we shared in our report about the Hackathon results.</p>
<p>What do these claims mean to you?</p>
<p>I recommend that you test these claims yourself. The claim – one or two hours of learning can help you write tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>With comprehensive inspection</li>
<li>Requiring less code</li>
<li>More easily maintained</li>
<li>Let you focus your time on high-value test activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>If true, would that be worth the investment?</p>
<p>It is up to you to find out.</p>

<p>Data security is rarely the first consideration when choosing a public cloud service provider. That&#8217;s changing, though, because of the rise of tougher rules, regulations, and standards aimed at protecting consumer privacy. Without data security, there can be no privacy.</p>
<p>Laws such as the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) are making chief information security officers pay closer attention to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/data-security-cloud-3-things-your-team-needs-know" rel="noopener noreferrer">what data security means in the cloud</a>. To comply with the laws, CISOs also need to understand what must be done to more effectively protect and govern data in a complex, geographically diverse, and hybrid IT ecosystem.</p>
<p>In <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cloud-security-data-privacy-tb/cloud-data-security?lx=8rSV2a&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent report</a>, Micro Focus data security products executive <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sid-dutta/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sid Dutta</a> described the offerings of the &#8220;big three&#8221; public cloud service providers (CSPs)—Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Amazon Web Services (AWS)—serving up a framework with strategic selection criteria, and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cloud-security-data-privacy-tb/bring-your-own-key-cloud?lx=8rSV2a&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">outlined what enterprises should be aware</a> of <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/5-tips-choosing-enterprise-cloud-services-provider" rel="noopener noreferrer">before cutting a deal with any CSP</a>. </p>
<p>Here are six key takeaways from the report.</p>
<p><em>[ Learn what matters in <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/cloud-security-data-privacy-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud security and privacy in TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide</a>.

<h3>1. CSP key management and encryption services have limitations</h3>
<p>These so-called HSM services have typically been added as a layer on top of the CSPs&#8217; existing stacks—an afterthought due to late recognition of their customers&#8217; increasing data security concerns, the report said.</p>
<p>In addition, the encryption model used by the major CSPs won&#8217;t meet the scaling requirements of many enterprises. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft &#8220;create a unique key for every data element,&#8221; Dutta explained in an interview. &#8220;So if you&#8217;re processing 10 million records, every data element in each record will require a unique key.&#8221;</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t scale when you&#8217;re doing a large volume of encryption, he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re going to have problems with availability, latency, and bandwidth.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If I don&#8217;t have the ability to perform bulk encryption that doesn&#8217;t rely on the network and the availability of that system, that, for me as a customer, is a no-go. I can&#8217;t make my endpoint 100% available because I don&#8217;t control the network that connects my client application and my encryption system.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="http://linkedin.com/in/sid-dutta" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sid Dutta</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/marknca" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mark Nunnikhoven</a>, vice president for cloud research at the security company Trend Micro, said the big three &#8220;offer a reasonable set of services around key management.&#8221; And with any cloud service, these are evolving rapidly.</p>
<p>However, the bigger question that comes from the Micro Focus report, and which is central to your overall data protection strategy, persists: Is it safe for the CSP to own the keys?</p>
<h3>2. Organizations cannot control encryption keys</h3>
<p>Organizations concerned about a CSP controlling the encryption keys to their data are told they <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cloud-security-data-privacy-tb/bring-your-own-key-cloud?lx=8rSV2a&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">can &#8220;bring their own keys&#8221; (BYOK)</a>. That&#8217;s misleading, the report contends. Even if a customer provides key material, it explained, the CSP still either owns or manages the master keys, which can be subject to subpoena or some other form of disclosure or abuse.</p>
<p>BYOK as a practice in the industry &#8220;has created a false perception that customer ownership and control of keys is established&#8221; when the fact is that, even if a customer generates and imports the keys into a CSP key-management system or cloud HSM, &#8220;it is the CSP that has direct or indirect control of the keys,&#8221; the report said. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;There is no hard isolation when it comes to cloud infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ameesh Divatia, CEO of the data protection company Baffle, said BYOK had limitations for enterprises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span><span style="color:#999999"><span><span><span>&#8220;It&#8217;s not completely foolproof, but it&#8217;s a step forward because the keys aren&#8217;t accessible to the cloud service provider.&#8221;</span></span></span></span></span><br /><span><span style="color:#999999"><span><span><span>—</span></span></span></span></span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ameeshd/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" style="color:#0096d6">Ameesh Divatia</a></p>

<h3>3. No one CSP can support enterprises&#8217; hybrid and multi-cloud environments</h3>
<p>The report explained that each CSP offers encryption services that are available and functional within the confines of their own clouds. That poses a challenge for enterprises using more than one CSP, not to mention on-premises legacy systems, to implement their workloads.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest challenge and concern for enterprises&#8221; is that they cannot implement a single, CSP-agnostic enterprise solution or service that can be applied across both on-premises and multi-cloud hosted workloads, the report said.</p>
<p>That can be especially challenging when it comes to encryption, because the CSPs don&#8217;t share keys.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t take all my keys from Amazon and put them on Google. That doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221;<br />—Sid Dutta</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andras Cser, vice president and principal analyst for security and risk management at Forrester Research, said this indeed can be tricky. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen a number of questions on this,&#8221; he said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not so much just vendor lock-in, but the inability to extend AWS KMS to Azure and vice versa.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/acser" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Andras Cser</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>4. CSP crypto services are not global</h3>
<p>The report explained that CSP crypto services are available in specific physical locations, referred to as regions. Even when these services are available, cross-region integrations and availability of keys is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Even though CSPs have a global footprint, &#8220;their crypto services are not global.&#8221; Not all regions have the KMS and cloud HSM services available, which forces enterprises to deploy and migrate their applications and data to specific CSP regions. The report notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;With enterprises going global through mergers and acquisitions, they cannot afford to have regional services and silos.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>5. CSP encryption choices are limited</h3>
<p>While all the CSPs offer crypto SDKs that support 256-bit GCM-mode AES, the report noted that other formats are largely unsupported. CSPs also don&#8217;t support the ability to partially expose some business elements without data decryption, or defined tokenization services to meet PCI-DSS requirements. </p>
<p>By limiting the encryption choices available to organizations, CSPs discourage the use of encryption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The reason that people shy away from encryption is there&#8217;s a perception—and in some cases a reality—that encryption breaks functionality.&#8221;<br />—Sid Dutta</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If, when you protect data, you remove the value from it so you can&#8217;t do your analytics and run artificial intelligence and machine learning on it to create new business insights, no one will want to encrypt the data, Dutta said.</p>
<p>You need to strike a balance between encryption and functionality, he said. &#8220;Then people will be happy to encrypt their data.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Everyone knows they need security, but they will take the easiest path, which will make them compliant but not secure.&#8221;<br />—Sid Dutta</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>6. Adopt a data-centric security attitude early</h3>
<p>The report recommends that enterprises develop <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/why-you-should-shift-your-cloud-security-strategy-stack" rel="noopener noreferrer">a cloud security strategy</a> early in the migration process. Data-centric security should be implemented before sensitive data is sent to the cloud.</p>
<p>CSPs do a good job of infrastructure hardening and implementing security processes and policies, and they offer multiple tools to enable customers to secure their workloads, the report said. However, one key takeaway stands out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;But it is very important to understand that CSPs are not responsible or liable for the security of the data that customers ingest into their services.&#8221;</p>

<p>The intent of this post is to share with you details of the <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/ultrafast-grid/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools Ultrafast Grid</a>, an evolution in <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/cross-browser-testing-ultrafast-grid/" rel="noopener noreferrer">cross-browser testing</a> designed for modern teams who test modern apps at scale.</p>



<p>The Ultrafast Grid represents the first true breakthrough in cross-browser testing architecture since it’s initial inception many years ago. It’s important to understand the differences between the traditional approach to cross browser testing and the modern approach that Applitools has taken.</p>

<h2 id="h.do20x0782qub">Early Web</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taking a look back at how the internet has evolved can certainly be nostalgic. Have you ever visited the <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/web/" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Way Back Machine’</a> and looked for companies that have been around for a while? It’s amazing how far the web has evolved. In its infancy, sites were mostly static, there were few content creators, blinking text and bad gifs were drastically over-used and web applications were just not sophisticated. The internet was often accessed via all-in-services like AOL or Prodigy, and for advanced users, a dedicated browser like Netscape Navigator.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":19357,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Fast forward to the late 90’s where usage of all-in-one providers diminished and a browser war began between IE and Netscape. At the time, web standards were poorly defined and web applications were gaining popularity. This created the need to test applications across browsers to ensure functional and visual defects were detected. Cross-browser testing was born – and quickly evolved from companies creating a local matrix to the usage of cloud-based VMs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="h.8fin08uoxg8">HTML 5 &amp; Responsive Web</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As mobile became dominant, so did the use of HTML5, CSS and responsive web applications. As a result, a new generation of browser wars began with additional players entering the mix, specifically Google Chrome, Firefox (born from Netscape), Safari – and Internet Explorer, which remained widely popular. At this point in time, traditional cross browser testing began to show scalability issues – and naturally so. There are now four main browsers that are updated far more frequently combined with multiple viewports and we haven’t even discussed operating systems.</p>

<p>Traditional cross browser testing executes tests built on your existing testing framework, (think  Selenium), across all browser, viewport, and OS combinations specified by the engineer. This  means a 2 minute test would need to run separately across each combination in the matrix. The issue that began to arise was the result of brittle functional tests, and the need to maintain connectivity and connection of those tests for every single browser, viewport, and OS combination.</p>

<h2 id="h.so8hws8q8r38">The Modern / Intelligent Web</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, we are in a phase referred to as the “intelligent” web. With chatbots, and more sophisticated omni-channel applications being driven by AI and ML. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS standards are strictly driven by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://whatwg.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">WHATWG</a> bringing deeper consistency across modern browsers. Additionally, modern JavaScript solutions like jQuery &amp; Babel have smoothed out browser support for JavaScript APIs, making the testing of browser engines themselves relatively binary. In a nutshell, the modern browser engines have been tested to near perfection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because of standards, you might expect any combination of browser, OS, device, and viewport size to function identically. And, unless you use platform-specific or device-specific functionality, that’s a reasonable expectation. So, what should you expect from cross-browser testing?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Functional differences between modern standards-compliant browsers happen rarely. You expect the browser to receive and process the same HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the server.  Rendering differences do occur, though, as each platform uses its own rendering engine. And those rendering differences can result in real-world functional differences from a user’s perspective.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, if your cross-browser tests run the same DOM across different devices, do you need to keep asking the server to serve up the same content multiple times to find defects caused by rendering?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="h.q52temd75in0">The Next Generation of Cross Browser Testing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you’ve read, traditional cross browser testing is not providing the ROI it once did, but a new modern approach is bringing new hope to quality-focused teams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Applitools Ultrafast Grid leverages Visual AI (AI powered computer vision) to test across browsers faster and with more coverage than ever possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is how it works:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your test suite is executed locally on a single browser. During execution, the Applitools SDKs capture the DOM &amp; CSS rules for every browser state and sends it to the Ultrafast Grid. This is a one-way connection thus does not require a reverse proxy or IPSec VPN – something any IT team with a focus on security can appreciate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, the Ultrafast Grid renders the DOM in parallel using containers and grabs a screenshot across each browser and viewport combination. The screenshots are then sent to Applitools Eyes for Visual AI analysis. This entire process is blazing fast – in a matter of seconds you are viewing results from the test run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because the tests are executed only once, connectivity and connection to the browser are only required for that single run which results in incredible stability of the run. What’s more – that single run also reduces the required set-up and tear down of data (data consumption).  Parallelization and containers result in incredible speeds and Visual AI can replace many of the brittle locators in your test code resulting in further stability.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="h.xwvgnn1lpgwf">Summary</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, your test coverage plan should be focused on your specific needs. If older browsers are still supported – you will want to ensure that you run your regression suite on each of those browsers and versions, plus a modern browser. By combining traditional cross-browser testing with the new modern approach, you can save time with faster builds and save money by reducing dependency on expensive cloud testing providers.</p>

<div>
<p dir="ltr">Companies are increasingly recognizing <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-engineering-critical?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">the value of performance engineering</a>, which goes well beyond performance testing. These organizations now require the capability to fix performance issues whenever and wherever they exist—and they&#8217;re willing to pay a premium for those skills. That’s why many performance testers are stepping up their game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-testing-to-engineering?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">the journey from performance tester to performance engineer</a> isn&#8217;t easy to complete, it <em>is</em> easy to start. You&#8217;ll just need to acquire a few skills and learn some new problem-solving techniques.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here&#8217;s how to start your own journey.</p>
<p><em>[ Learn best practices for <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/reduce-defects-software-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">reducing software defects </a><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/reduce-defects-software-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide</a>.

<h3>Performance testing is part of performance engineering</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The first thing to understand about <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/resources/performance-engineering-ebook-report-load-testing" rel="noopener noreferrer">performance engineering</a> is that performance testing is just one aspect of it. Performance engineering has a broader scope.</p>
<p>Why the current emphasis on performance engineering over just testing? Because testing product performance at the end of the software development cycle produces too much <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/drowning-technical-debt-worse-youre-trapped-ponzi-scheme" rel="noopener noreferrer">technical debt</a> and causes too much rework. It&#8217;s too expensive.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Companies need to figure out how to build performance into products as early as possible in the development process, and that requires more than just performance testing. When development teams are discussing functionality, security, or any topic for that matter, performance should be part of the conversation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are seven areas where performance should play a key role.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Figure 1. Performance engineering plays a role in every phase of the software development lifecycle. Source: Scott Moore</em></p>
<h3>Performance testing is still important </h3>
<p dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/dont-do-performance-testing-production-environments-only" rel="noopener noreferrer">Performance testing is still a crucial part</a> of software and infrastructure validation. Doing that accurately and efficiently takes time. This is especially true during the planning phase as well as during test results analysis.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Producing data that guides businesses to make good decisions takes experiential knowledge. Unfortunately, there aren&#8217;t many people who do all of this extremely well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Building a set of reusable documents and other deliverables (&#8220;templates&#8221;) to use in the initial planning phase and final reporting will speed your initial startup time. I recommend working with or learning from others with experience to build out some of these templates.</p>
<p><em>[ Understand what your team needs to know to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com//l/software-test-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">take advantage of test automation</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide. Plus: Get the <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/software-test-automation-tb/buyers-guide-software-test-automation?lx=wYdl7c&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buyer&#8217;s Guide For Software Test Automation Tools</a> ]</em></p>
<h3>How to make the transition to performance engineer</h3>
<p>How do you make <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-embed-performance-engineering-your-pipeline" rel="noopener noreferrer">the transition from performance tester to performance engineer</a>? Start with these three high-level changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Widen your perspective. </strong>Instead of thinking about whether a test passes or meets the requirements, think about whether the end user will be delighted. Look at the app through the user&#8217;s eyes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Include the whole lifecycle in your scope. </strong>Think about all of the areas you might need to address performance. Do the requirements include the right performance criteria? Are units of code, all the individual pieces, and the whole thing together performant? What does the end user think? How do you know the answers to these questions? What are you looking at that tells you whether performance is good or bad, or when it changes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>See a need, fill a need.</strong> As you learn to apply performance to a given situation, you&#8217;ll start to notice holes, places where the team is not considering performance. Your job is to attempt to fill those holes. Because you now see the whole software development lifecycle, you aren&#8217;t limited to thinking just about the testing phase. Help wherever there is an issue, even if it isn&#8217;t in your formal job description.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tech skills to master</h4>
<p dir="ltr">There are also a few technical skills you’ll need to pick up.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Gain front-end performance knowledge, specifically regarding the browser itself.</strong> JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and other client-side components contribute to the performance of web page response times. Know how each affects the metrics you see <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lifewire.com/web-browser-developer-tools-3988965" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">in browser developer tools</a>, such as time to first byte, idle time, and so on. Learn how the underlying protocols—such as HTTP(S), QUIC, and web sockets—work from the browser to the back-end servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Learn how to gather <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/beyond-fast-understanding-performance-engineering-metrics-really-matter" rel="noopener noreferrer">the right metrics</a> needed to tell the performance story.</strong> This includes utilities for Windows and Linux, open-source products such as Prometheus to monitor containers and Kubernetes clusters, or commercial tools such as total <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/6-application-performance-management-trends-watch" rel="noopener noreferrer">application performance monitoring</a> solutions. Combine these with end-user monitoring (timings from the user&#8217;s perspective) and real-user monitoring (grabbing times from actual user activity).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Learn how continuous integration (CI/CD) products such as Jenkins, Bamboo, and others work. </strong>Set up a strategy for building out a continuous performance engineering process so that you can report metrics with each new build and you can observe trends as early as possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Shift performance left</h3>
<p dir="ltr">As a performance engineer you need to shift left by doing these three very simple things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Ask whether the business process workflow performs well for a single person.</strong> Baselining the application by gathering initial metrics from the browser or sites such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.webpagetest.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Web Page Test</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://gtmetrix.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GTMetrix</a> is an easy way to tell. Look at the recommendations from Google Lighthouse from the audits tab in Chrome&#8217;s DevTools. And find out why each suggestion in the report is being recommended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Work with individual Scrum teams and find out who is taking responsibility for performance in their assigned features. </strong><a target="_blank" href="http://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-build-performance-requirements-your-user-stories" rel="noopener noreferrer">Review a user story</a> and determine whether it includes solid performance requirements. If possible, provide those teams with limited access to performance testing tools and teach them how to do their own browser audits (as mentioned above) as soon as a feature is working in the development environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Question whether performance metrics have been added to the continuous build cycles (the CI/CD pipeline). </strong>If so, who is looking at them? Is anyone reporting performance trends from the output? If not, help to make that possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>A real-world example</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Not long ago I was engaged to load-test a highly customized version of a SaaS product that was replacing all of my client&#8217;s current systems. They had put more than two years of effort into their customized workflows and were just a couple of months away from starting the rollout.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The statement of work was fairly standard. They wanted to do performance testing of their critical business processes and determine user response times and how well the infrastructure held up under the expected volume. It sounded like a typical testing process.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After an initial orientation, I asked to see the application. I opened a browser window, went to the URL, logged in, and immediately saw that the page response was slow. So I opened up Chrome DevTools in the browser and started looking at the information in the various tabs for network, performance, and audits.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Figure 2. An example view of the performance tab in the </em><em>DevTools feature that&#8217;s built into the Google Chrome browser.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Within minutes I was telling the QA manager that his application would fail under load and that response times would not pass his service-level objective. I didn&#8217;t need to run a test because I knew what to expect, having tested many applications like this one in the past. But they were skeptical as I confidently told them—without any test results to back me up—that the application needed some fundamental architectural changes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I was ready to pivot away from the existing statement of work and start working with their developers and architects to tune the application before we did any testing, since that would have provided better value.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, they rejected my suggestion and insisted that I stick with the original plan of conducting basic load-testing activities. This turned into a six-week exercise, at the conclusion of which I unveiled the brutal news that the application would not scale and needed fundamental architectural changes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The client had spent years of time, resources, and money building this application. Unfortunately, the outcome was tragic: They lost millions of dollars, and the failure to launch the application on time led to the resignation of the CIO. If that CIO had had a performance engineer acting as a trusted advisor from the beginning, all of this could have been avoided.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Performance engineering is really about asking the right questions at the right time.</p>
<h3>How to get started</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Performance testing is still important and relevant, and organizations will always need people who are very good at it. <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-engineering-techniques?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">Performance engineering</a> has a much broader mandate: It&#8217;s about using additional skills to accomplish the same outcome as you would with performance testing—to make software perform optimally so it delights the end user.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But with performance engineering, you do that from beginning to end, at every opportunity throughout the software development lifecycle.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If your software is functional, that&#8217;s good. But if it doesn&#8217;t perform well, it won&#8217;t be considered great. At the end of the day, you should not still be having conversations around how slow applications are or how long web pages are taking to display. That should be a fundamental element built into all areas of the product. It should be engineered in from the start.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The main difference between an engineer and a tester is that an engineer does not need to run a test to diagnose or assist in correcting a performance issue. (For a more in-depth discussion of the differences, listen to my <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/TWnv6EzfXWM" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">podcast discussion </a>with Perfbytes Podcast host <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/perfpulley" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">James Pulley</a>.) Performance engineers attack it from every angle.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To become a performance engineer, all you need is passionate curiosity and a willingness to help. Sometimes just starting a conversation can get the wheels turning in the right direction. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Your performance engineering journey will never be complete, because the technology changes continually and there&#8217;s always something new to learn. Get started by becoming involved wherever you can to make things faster, continuously asking performance questions, and continuously sharing what you know to educate others on why performance is important and adds value. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Robotic process automation (RPA) technology helps organizations automate defined, multi-step manual tasks that are done in high volume. RPA does this]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p>
<div>
<p>Robotic process automation (RPA) technology helps organizations automate defined, multi-step manual tasks that are done in high volume. RPA does this by creating software robots, or RPA bots, that emulate human actions to interact with existing application interfaces.</p>
<p>Organizations typically pair RPA bots with tasks that stretch across multiple legacy technology applications or platforms that aren&#8217;t easily linked. Sometimes referred to as &#8220;swivel chair&#8221; activities, these are processes where people essentially respond to alerts or prompts from one system, then use some of that data to take action in another system. </p>
<p>In this way, <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/robotic-process-automation-tb/rpa-enterprise-it?lx=jNs_Bd&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPA excels at helping organizations automate and eliminate error</a> from established processes, all without ripping and replacing legacy systems.</p>
<p><em>[ Learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/enterprise-service-management-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to optimize your Enterprise Service Management (ESM)</a>. Plus: Get TechBeacon&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/buyers-guide-esm-products?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buyers Guide to ESM Products</a> ]</em></p>
<h3>Where RPA makes sense (and where it doesn&#8217;t)</h3>
<p>RPA technologies can be used for many different applications, but <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/robotic-process-automation-tb/get-started-rpa?lx=jNs_Bd&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">the easiest places to start</a> typically crop up in finance and human resources.</p>
<p>One category that makes a good RPA candidate is procure-to-pay use cases. This is where low-level employees spend a lot of time processing inbound invoices, reconciling invoices, and issuing payments—running through routine, repetitive tasks each time they do them. Similarly, if finance personnel have to do a lot of cutting and pasting from one operational system into another finance system to tally up billable hours or shipped product before sending out an invoice, RPA can automate those actions.</p>
<p>HR use cases tend to crop up in very formalized but frequent procedures, such as onboarding, that require recurring actions in many systems for each new employee. For example, RPA can help initiate new accounts, process inbound employee forms, and so on.</p>
<p>HR can also lean heavily on RPA to help with time-consuming manual activities such as the reimbursement claims approval process. Before automation, this required employees to visually confirm scans of employee receipts and ensure that totals matched up before approving a claim.</p>
<p>Now, RPA bots armed with optical character recognition (OCR) scans can be placed at the front end of that procedure to approve the majority of receipts, perhaps with humans on hand to do a second pass when receipts are smudged or there&#8217;s a discrepancy.</p>
<p>These examples are just the beginning when considering possible RPA use cases. Others include using RPA bots to complete routine sales analysis based on input from many different systems, leveraging bots in IT situations for routine systems maintenance and monitoring, and using the technology to aid in supply chain planning and stock optimization.</p>
<h3>Tips for figuring out where to start</h3>
<p>As organizations <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/resources/techbeacon-guide-how-roll-out-robotic-process-automation" rel="noopener noreferrer">identify use cases for RPA</a>, experts recommend that they seek out scenarios where:</p>
<p>Organizations should be wary of trying to automate activities that require a lot of human interpretation of unstructured data.</p>
<p>And even if a process is repetitive and defined, be careful that you&#8217;re not automating a fundamentally bad or obsolete process using RPA. In some cases, it may be worth the investment to re-engineer processes, develop better integrations or APIs to glue together systems, or even pay down technical debt and re-architect your underlying systems.</p>
<p><em>[ Get up to speed on <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/it-operations-monitoring-tb?utm_campaign=00134846&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_source=techbeacon" rel="noopener noreferrer">IT Operations Monitoring with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide</a>.

<h3>What&#8217;s next: How RPA is evolving</h3>
<p>When RPA first arose as a category, it evolved from macros that automated simple tasks into programmable bots based on a set of human-defined process rules. </p>
<p>These bots helped improve efficiency in isolated situations, but organizations soon struggled on two fronts. First, discovering and defining processes for the bots to automate—at scale—has been <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-train-your-bots-5-rpa-fails-avoid" rel="noopener noreferrer">a challenge for RPA</a> from the start. Second, the management of the bots themselves and the process-defined rule-sets that direct their actions have become a big bugbear.</p>
<p>This is what has led to the growth in RPA platforms, which can help on both fronts. <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-choose-right-rpa-tool" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPA tools</a> help automate the discovery of the processes and provide tools for line-of-business users to more easily build automations based on their process needs, often based on pre-built bot libraries. Additionally, platforms define rules that govern and orchestrate the way bots run.</p>
<p>RPA vendors are trying to flex the limits of process definition by developing machine learning capabilities to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/robotic-process-automation-5-key-trends-watch" rel="noopener noreferrer">automatically discover and learn processes</a>. Increasingly, vendors are building in the ability to record and analyze user actions and then use machine learning to automatically define process rules and reduce the number of manual steps.</p>
<p>However, the heavy lifting still typically falls on business stakeholders and the automation team to get things rolling.</p>
<p>Usually, however, RPA projects <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/13-robotic-process-automation-experts-you-should-follow" rel="noopener noreferrer">require the aid of consultants and integrators</a>, which is why<a target="_blank" href="https://www.horsesforsources.com/RPA-forecast-2016-2022_120118" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> analysts project</a> a threefold increase in spending on RPA software through 2022.</p>
