					<description><![CDATA[No doubt, we have a lot to be hopeful for as we step into the New Year. We’ve adapted, survived,]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>No doubt, we have a lot to be hopeful for as we step into the New Year. We’ve adapted, survived, and learned to thrive under extraordinary circumstances. While faced with plenty of challenges, families successfully transitioned to working and learning from home like pros. So, as we set our intentions for 2021, we will need that same resolve to tackle growing cyber threats.</p>
<p><strong>The good news:</strong> With a COVID-19 vaccine making its debut, we’re trusting there’s an end in sight to the pandemic of 2020, which may help curb a lot of our emotional as well as digital stressors.</p>
<p><strong>The not-so-good-news:</strong> According to McAfee’s latest <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/mcafee-labs-report-reveals-continuing-surge-of-covid-19-threats-and-malware/?hilite=%27November%27%2C%27threats%27%2C%272020%27" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quarterly Threat Report</a>, pandemic-themed threats that began in 2020 will continue, specifically, phishing and malware scams targeting people working from home. According to the recent report, bad actors are especially taking advantage of the mass remote workforces.</p>
<p>According to Raj Samani, McAfee Fellow and Chief Scientist, “What began as a trickle of phishing campaigns and the occasional malicious app quickly turned into a deluge of malicious URLs, attacks on cloud users and capable threat actors leveraging the world’s thirst for more information on COVID-19 as an entry mechanism into systems across the globe.”</p>
<p>This report points inspires a few best practices for families as we launch a new year: Stay informed and keep talking about the threats and — as grandma might advise — dress in layers to protect against the elements (in this case, digital threats).</p>
<p><strong>Safe Family Tips</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Information is power.</strong>The best defense against online threats is a good offense, which is the digital space means staying informed. The more you know about how hackers exploit consumers, the more you can dodge shady phishing scams such as emails trying to sell you the COVID-19 vaccine online or a voucher allowing you to skip the vaccination line.</li>
<li><strong>Verify email sources.</strong>Be skeptical of emails or text messages claiming to be from people you know or organizations with requests or offers that seem too good to be true. Before you click, go straight to the organization’s website or contact customer service. Verifying sources will help you steer clear of downloading malicious content from phishing links. Remind family members to keep their guards up and never to share personal information.</li>
<li><strong>Hover over links, scrutinize URLs.</strong>If someone sends you a message with a link, hover over the link without clicking on it. This will allow you to see a link preview. If the URL looks suspicious, delete the message. A few red flags: Fake links generally imitate established websites but may include unnecessary words and domains in the address. When in doubt about a link’s validity — don’t click.</li>
<li><strong>Think in layers.</strong>When it comes to cybersecurity for the new year, try thinking (or dressing) your devices in layers. A few ways to layer up:</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">• Use 2FA passwords. Regularly changing passwords and adding two-factor authentication (2FA) is proving to be the most effective way to thwart hackers. If you work from home, 2FA is a more secure way to access work applications. This password/username combo requires you to verify who you are with a personal device only you own puts an extra barrier between your data and a creative hacker.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">• Use a VPN. If you travel or choose to work in a coffee shop, a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn/mcafee-safe-connect.html" rel="noopener">Virtual Private Network (VPN)</a> will give your family an encrypted channel that shields your online activity from hackers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">• Security software. If you’ve been cobbling your security plan together, consider one <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" rel="noopener">comprehensive security solution</a> to help protect you from malware, phishing attacks, and viruses. Leading products such as McAfee Total protection will include safe browsing and a VPN.</p>
<p>The past year, while difficult, also gave us several gifts to carry into 2021. For families, it connected us with our resilience and creativity. It made us wiser, braver, and more ready for the challenges ahead, be they online or within the ebb and flow of everyday life. That’s something we can all celebrate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>The sudden shift to a largely distributed workforce because of the COVID-19 pandemic complicated already Byzantine security challenges at many organizations this year.</p>
<p>Security teams were forced to find ways to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/zero-trust-security-tb/state-zero-trust-cybersecurity?lx=9nmHuO&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">protect their enterprise from an army of work-from-home users</a> even as they had to confront other challenges from ongoing digital transformation initiatives and cloud adoption.</p>
<p><i>TechBeacon</i>&#8216;s top 12 security stories from 2020 provide a broad overview of the trends, challenges, and changes that organizations had to deal with on all of the major fronts: <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/state-of-application-security-testing-tb/6-best-practices-for?lx=QKJph-&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">application security</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/state-of-secops-tb/state-secops-202021-takeaways?lx=ipOpkU&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">information security</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cloud-security-data-privacy-tb/cloud-security-data-privacy-trends?lx=8rSV2a&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">data security</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/zero-trust-security-tb/state-zero-trust-cybersecurity?lx=9nmHuO&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">identity and access management</a>.</p>
<h3>Application security</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/more-authorities-more-cves-what-it-means-app-sec-teams" rel="noopener">More authorities, more CVEs: What it means for app sec teams</a></h4>
<p>A <i>TechBeacon</i> analysis of the widely used National Vulnerability Database (NVD) showed that organizations have more to be worried about than just the rising number of vulnerabilities. With the threat landscape changing rapidly, organizations also need to be cognizant of the different types of vulnerabilities being disclosed, their organization&#8217;s exposure to those threats, and risks from vulnerable open-source components in their software.</p>
<p>Freelance writer <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/roblemos?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener">Rob Lemos</a> explains why companies need to adjust their development, patching, and app sec practices to address the increasing number of vulnerabilities being identified, and offers other key takeaways.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/3-new-rules-cloud-native-application-security" rel="noopener">3 new rules of cloud-native application security</a></h4>
<p>The rapid adoption of SaaS applications has created a variety of new security problems for enterprises. Mobile workforces opened up new holes in the network perimeter a decade ago, and SaaS applications are doing the same now and forcing organizations to rethink traditional approaches to application security. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/dd_davidoff?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener">Dror Davidoff</a>, co-founder and CEO of container and cloud-security provider Aqua Security, says addressing the security issues around how organizations configure and use cloud-native applications requires new thinking.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/critical-api-security-risks-10-best-practices" rel="noopener">Critical API security risks: 10 best practices</a></h4>
<p>Application programming interfaces (APIs) that connect services and transfer data have become critical for microservices architectures, but are becoming increasingly harder to secure because of their growing numbers. Common API security risks include excessive data exposure, misconfiguration, insufficient monitoring, and logging and broken authorization mechanisms at the object, user, and function levels. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/lucycloudbling?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener">Lucy Kerner</a>, security evangelist and strategist at Red Hat, draws on her expertise as a cloud security architect to compile this handy list of 10 best practices for managing API risks.</p>
<h3>Information security</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/state-secops-202021-its-time-think-beyond-soc" rel="noopener">The State of SecOps: It&#8217;s time to think beyond the SOC</a></h4>
<p>The global pandemic has pushed many companies to accelerate their digital transformation initiatives—not just for business continuity purposes, but also as a way to take advantage of new market opportunities, deliver new customer channels, and leapfrog the competition. The changes have broadened the operational attack surface and increased exposure to automated, AI-based exploits at many organizations. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbfernandes/" rel="nofollow noopener">Mark Fernandes</a>, CTO of security at <em>TechBeacon</em> corporate parent Micro Focus, explains why digital transformation requires organizations to think beyond the traditional SOC to concepts such as an integrated threat operations center (ITOC).</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/8-lessons-garmin-ransomware-attack" rel="noopener">8 lessons from the Garmin ransomware attack</a></h4>
<p>Some breaches are either so big in scope or so significant that they serve as lessons to others of what <i>not </i>to do when it comes to information security. One example is a ransomware attack at GPS smartwatch maker Garmin in July 2020 that forced the company to shut down its main customers for five days while it attempted to recover locked systems. In the end, Garmin paid a multimillion-dollar ransom to get the decryption key to restore encrypted data. Freelance writer <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jpmello" rel="nofollow noopener">John P. Mello, Jr.</a> spoke with multiple industry experts to compile this list of eight major takeaways from the Garmin attack.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/5-ways-make-your-serverless-functions-more-secure" rel="noopener">5 ways to make your serverless functions more secure</a></h4>
<p>Serverless applications allow developers to create custom functions and speed up app deployment without having to worry about issues such as the underlying infrastructure and delays while the operations team spins up virtual machines or containers. A survey that RightScale conducted found that more than one-third of the respondent organizations already had deployed serverless apps for these reasons. In this report, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/emjohn20" rel="nofollow noopener">Eric Johnson</a>, a senior instructor at the SANS Institute, explains why, in their enthusiasm to use the technology, development teams should not overlook security.</p>
<h3>Data security</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/how-meet-privacy-requirements-your-pii" rel="noopener">How to meet privacy requirements with your PII</a></h4>
<p>Regulations such as the <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/gdpr-execution-will-be-major-task-year-reap-benefits" rel="noopener">European Union&#8217;s GDPR</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/what-your-data-security-team-needs-know-about-ccpa" rel="noopener">California&#8217;s CCPA</a>, and Turkey&#8217;s KVKK have put enormous pressure on organizations to better protect personally identifying information (PII) belonging to customers, employees, and others. The regulations mandate not just better data security but also processes that allow data subjects to ask for and expeditiously receive copies of their PII. Meeting these requirements can be challenging and highlights the need for new processes where PII files can be quickly identified, indexed, and retrieved, says <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-humphrey-0919293/" rel="nofollow noopener">Dave Humphrey</a>, CTO at Micro Focus. In this report he offers advice on how privacy and security leaders can best meet PII privacy requirements.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/cobol-gdpr-why-format-preserving-data-protection-key" rel="noopener">COBOL and GDPR: Why format-preserving data protection is key</a></h4>
<p>COBOL continues to be one of the most widely used programming languages, especially among large organizations, though it has been around for six decades. The main reason for its longevity is the sheer value of the business logic encapsulated in COBOL code over all these years. Nobody wants to rewrite the code, because it is working fine, says <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/phsiii/" rel="nofollow noopener">Phil Smith III</a>, senior product manager and architect for mainframe and enterprise at Micro Focus. Smith, who has deep experience with z/OS, z/VM, and Linux on IBM mainframes, explains why format-preserving data protection is the best way to guard data in COBOL environments in a compliance-friendly manner.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/what-you-need-know-about-bring-your-own-key-cloud" rel="noopener">What you need to know about &#8216;bring your own key&#8217; in the cloud</a></h4>
<p>Many organizations have adopted a cloud-first or cloud-only strategy because of the scale, agility, and consumption-based pricing benefits available in the cloud. However, few have done so with any formal strategy for data security. Often, organizations have hybrid, multi-cloud environments where they are forced to deal with different security models that they know little about. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sid-dutta/" rel="nofollow noopener">Sid Dutta</a>, data security evangelist at Micro Focus, takes a look at some of the data-centric security capabilities available from the biggest cloud providers.</p>
<h3>Identity and access management</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/zero-trust-remote-workforces-identity-access-management-key" rel="noopener">Zero trust and remote work: Identity and access management is key</a></h4>
<p>The large-scale shift to remote work as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic exposed organizations to a slew of new cyber security risks this year. Security teams suddenly were forced to find ways to secure the enterprise network against remote workers logging in from insecure home networks, often with poorly protected personally owned devices. This report, from freelance writer <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/roblemos?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener">Rob Lemos</a>, on the importance of a zero-trust security model in this environment, is based on perspective from industry analysts and security specialists.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/why-your-approach-security-architecture-needs-change" rel="noopener">Why your approach to security architecture needs to change</a></h4>
<p>Many security groups might think they are doing all the right things to protect sensitive enterprise data against improper access and abuse. The reality is quite different, says <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-nikols-754383/" rel="nofollow noopener">Nick Nikols</a>, vice president of strategy at Micro Focus. Nikols, whose areas of specialization include identity and access management (IAM), says that while many companies may have invested heavily in comprehensive IAM, the architecture at their organizations is not equipped to deal with how data travels in the cloud. He explains why security leaders should consider revamping their security architectures for the cloud.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/how-iam-powers-cyber-resilience-5-best-practices" rel="noopener">How IAM powers cyber resilience: 5 best practices</a></h4>
<p>Even the best security controls can be undermined by a lack of secure identity and access management practices. IAM is the foundation of cyber resilience. To be good at it, organizations need to have comprehensive control and an unimpeded, real-time view of identities across the enterprise, says <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/MacDonaldRob" rel="nofollow noopener">Rob MacDonald</a>, security evangelist at Micro Focus. Here he offers five best practices for strengthening cyber resilience with strong IAM practices.</p>

<p><span><span>Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other approaches that can help automate key IT operations functions are gaining traction in IT Ops, and some of the silos that existed between <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cyber-resilience-tb/cyber-resilience-trends-secops?lx=dSbBFJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">operations and security teams have begun to converge</a>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i>TechBeacon</i>&#8216;s<i> </i>top 12 enterprise IT stories for 2020 highlight the challenges that IT teams face as they try to balance the need to innovate against requirements to keep the business up and running. The articles offer expert guidance on <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/ai-ops-transform-it-tb/aiops-enterprise-6-t?lx=my3YKV&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">how to navigate change and achieve desired outcomes in 2021</a>, and highlight trends and best practices for IT practitioners to follow.</span></span></p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/its-time-it-ops-security-tools-finally-converge" rel="noopener">It&#8217;s time for IT Ops and security tools to finally converge</a></h4>
<p>Large-scale cyber-security events can often require a combined response from the security team, the IT operations group, product support, engineering, and other stakeholders in the enterprise. Unfortunately, these teams typically operate in separate silos, and the tools that each brings to the remediation effort can have overlapping functionality.</p>
<p>In this report, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeromelabat/" rel="nofollow noopener">Jerome Labat</a>, chief technology officer at healthcare systems provider Cerner, explains the evolution of the two-parallel-tool-sets phenomenon at many companies and why it&#8217;s time for IT operations and security tools to converge.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/state-it-operations-10-trends-watch" rel="noopener">The state of IT operations: 10 trends to watch</a></h4>
<p>IT operations teams do a lot more than just keeping the lights on at their organizations. Increasingly, they are the enablers of digital transformation, and the decisions they make can have long-lasting impact across the enterprise. That&#8217;s why IT pros need to keep on top of the latest trends now more than ever. Freelance writer <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jpmello" rel="nofollow noopener">John P. Mello, Jr.</a> talked with more than half a dozen IT pros to compile this list of the top 10 trends to watch in the IT Ops space over the coming year.</p>
<h3>Digital transformation</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/innovate-deliver-how-do-both-during-your-digital-transformation" rel="noopener">Innovate and deliver: How to do both during your digital transformation</a> </h4>
<p>The challenge with digital transformation initiatives is that IT organizations are expected to keep the business up and running even as they are called upon to innovate and transform. Doing both can be tricky, but as Cerner chief technology officer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeromelabat/" rel="nofollow noopener">Jerome Labat</a> explains, it can be accomplished by adopting the right strategy. Here, Labat explains the strategy that Micro Focus, <em>TechBeacon</em>&#8216;s corporate parent, adopted in its own IT digital transformation efforts when he was Micro Focus&#8217; CTO. And he highlights three key lessons that he says other organizations can apply to their own efforts.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-create-successful-digital-transformation-road-map" rel="noopener">How to create a successful digital transformation road map</a></h4>
<p>Digital transformation is more than just about technology, says <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bsairam/?originalSubdomain=in" rel="nofollow noopener">Sairam Bollapragada</a>, director of the global delivery center at Micro Focus professional services. Here he explains why the array of products, platforms, and devices that vendors sell are merely tools toward an end and not ends in themselves. Organizations that want to succeed at digital transformation need to have a clear road map and know how to leverage technology in an outcome-focused way to get there, he says.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-software-enabled-services-are-new-disruptor" rel="noopener">Why software-enabled services are the new disruptor</a></h4>
<p>Software-enabled services (SES) can help IT teams keep pace with digital transformation and are expected to be a major disruptor for both SaaS providers and on-premises software development models. SES take a factory approach to building software and delivers greater speed and agility benefits for the business world. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keithjahn/" rel="nofollow noopener">Keith Jahn</a>, vice president of digital factory at healthcare tech provider Cerner, says SES can help developers achieve desired outcomes quicker. He shows how organizations that have not yet begun their SES journey can get there.</p>
<h3>Robotic process automation</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-train-your-bots-5-rpa-fails-avoid" rel="noopener">How to train your bots: 5 RPA fails to avoid</a></h4>
<p>A broad perception exists that robotic process automation is hard to implement and prone to failures. Despite the enormous promise and inevitability of intelligent automation, a lot of organizations that have tried their hand at it have described it as not seeming to work. That perception is neither fair nor accurate, says Leading Edge Forum (and ex-Gartner) analyst <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/CSurdak" rel="nofollow noopener">Christopher Surdak</a>. Here he explains why most RPA failures are less serious than they appear and lists five of the most common mistakes to avoid if you want to succeed with RPA and AI.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/robotic-process-automation-5-key-trends-watch" rel="noopener">Robotic process automation: 5 key trends to watch</a></h4>
<p>There&#8217;s a high level of interest in robotic process automation (RPA) in enterprises. Industry analysts, in fact, expect that the market for RPA tools will outpace the rest of the technology industry over the next 12 months. However, some organizations that have already implemented RPA are running into problems, and many are reevaluating the tools and processes they are looking to automate. Freelance writer <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ErickaChick" rel="nofollow noopener">Ericka Chickowski</a> spoke to industry experts to compile this list of five trends to watch in the RPA space.</p>
<h3>AI Ops</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/4-reasons-why-aiops-future-it-operations" rel="noopener">4 reasons why AIOps is the future of IT operations</a></h4>
<p>Hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructure can be complex to manage, especially when digital transformation initiatives outpace the IT organization&#8217;s performance management capabilities. AIOps platforms, which Gartner describes as software systems that combine big data with AI and machine-learning functions, can help make IT operations more efficient. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/n-karthik-75138ab" rel="nofollow noopener">N. Karthik</a>, Micro Focus&#8217; country manager for enterprise sales, offers four reasons why AI and ML are the future of IT Ops.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/top-10-predictions-ai-it-operations" rel="noopener">Top 10 predictions for AI in IT operations</a></h4>
<p>The use of AI in IT operations has been gradually increasing in the years since analyst firm Gartner first coined the term AIOps. These days IT Ops tools that incorporate AI have become quite common, as has AI-enhanced automation. Even so, IT leaders remain wary about using AI functions for a variety of reasons. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiayigu/" rel="nofollow noopener">Jiayi Hoffman</a>, data science architect at OpsRamp, and expert at machine learning, lists 10 predictions for AIOps that she says IT operations specialists should track.</p>
<h3>Enterprise service management</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-esm-fails-7-sure-fire-ways-kill-your-project" rel="noopener">Why ESM fails: 7 sure-fire ways to kill your project</a></h4>
<p>Many organizations around the world have implemented enterprise service management (ESM) initiatives to streamline and optimize the customer services that multiple teams jointly provide within an organization. When done correctly, ESM projects can help improve customer satisfaction, improve productivity, and cut costs. But they work only when IT organizations can identify the true needs of their customers and are willing to work across siloed functions. <em>TechBeacon</em> contributing editor <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ssalgy" rel="nofollow noopener">Susan Salgy</a> identifies seven key issues that can threaten the success of ESM projects.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-esm-must-evolve-automate-end-end-value-streams" rel="noopener">Why ESM must evolve to automate end-to-end value streams</a></h4>
<p>Enterprise service management requires a lot more than just adapting and applying IT service management (ITSM) concepts to other areas of the business. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/dougtedder" rel="nofollow noopener">Doug Tedder</a>, principal at Tedder Consulting LLC and a veteran of numerous IT transformation projects, explains why organizations need to evolve their approaches to ESM projects if they want to achieve desired outcomes.</p>
<h3>Careers</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/best-places-work-tech-5-lessons-dev-ops-security" rel="noopener">Best places to work in tech: 5 lessons for dev, ops, and security</a></h4>
<p>Salaries for application developers, security analysts, network administrators, and other IT specialists tend to be considerably higher in major metropolitan areas such as San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles than in other parts of the country. However, when salaries are adjusted against cost-of-living expenses, the areas delivering the highest salaries for these professions are smaller and mid-sized cities such as Bloomington, Indiana; Bay City, Michigan; and Rome, Georgia. Freelance writer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roblemos/" rel="nofollow noopener">Rob Lemos</a> highlights the key takeaways of a <em>TechBeacon</em> analysis of salaries for four occupations and explains why smaller metropolitan areas are becoming the new tech hubs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<h3>All-remote workforce </h3>
<p>Like most other companies (essential workers notwithstanding), we were forced to shift to an all-remote workforce, meaning many Saucers found themselves working from home for the first time. This presented challenges, of course—some of us simultaneously became homeschool teachers, we lost the ability to have quick hallway conversations, and we just plain missed seeing our coworkers—but in the end, we rallied together and embraced the new normal (or should we say the Zoom normal?). </p>
<h3>Virtual user conference </h3>
<p>As the events of 2020 unfolded, we had to transform our popular SauceCon user conference into a virtual event: SauceCon Online. Although we missed seeing the testing community in person, we were able to host the event in two different time zones, which meant we could include people who might not otherwise be able to join us on-site. In fact, we were thrilled to have more than 5,000 registrants from 98 countries across two days! And thanks to a knowledgeable group of speakers and sponsors, the agenda was packed full of testing goodness, helping everyone in attendance to “Test Better, Together.” We also turned our Test Automation Days into virtual events, and were able to host different sessions by customer and by industry. Look for a virtual Test Automation Day near you soon! </p>
<p>We’re also reprising <a target="_blank" href="https://saucecon.com/" rel="noopener">SauceCon Online</a> April 20-22, so save the date and submit a <a target="_blank" href="https://saucecon.com/cfp-2021/" rel="noopener">speaking proposal</a> if you’d like to contribute.</p>
<h3>Open Source Program Office</h3>
<p>Open source is part of our DNA here at Sauce. In 2020, we created our <a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.saucelabs.com/" rel="noopener">Open Source Program Office</a> to deepen our investment in the broader open source community. This was a key part of our strategy to truly leverage sustainable and active support for open source software (OSS) within the company, and adding this was a huge highlight of 2020. </p>
<h3>Three billion tests … and counting </h3>
<p>In March 2020, we celebrated the three billionth test on the Sauce Labs platform. Yep, you read that right: three billion! We’ve learned a lot after that many tests, and we’ve gained expertise across many facets of testing. In 2020, we launched our second annual <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/resources/white-papers/sauce-labs-continuous-testing-benchmark-report-2020" rel="noopener">Continuous Testing Benchmark Report</a>, documenting observations based on those three billion tests. This report shows key performance benchmarks necessary to deliver automated testing at enterprise scale as well as how real-world organizations performed against those benchmarks. Now, our Data Science team is applying Machine Learning (ML) and pattern recognition against this rich store of data to provide our users with the guidance they need to improve their automated testing success. </p>
<h3>Elemental Selenium and Sauce School</h3>
<p>In 2020, we acquired Dave Haeffner&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://elementalselenium.com/" rel="noopener">Elemental Selenium</a> content library and site properties—and turned them into a great new training resource we’re calling <a target="_blank" href="https://training.saucelabs.com/" rel="noopener">Sauce School</a>. Testers have long used Elemental Selenium to learn how to automate their tests. This content is not only relevant to folks just getting started with Selenium, but also for experienced automation engineers who want to brush up on best practices and advanced concepts like parallel testing.  Dave’s Selenium guidance combined with the Sauce Labs platform offers a powerful combination of comprehensive testing coverage and proven real-world advice—an unbeatable formula that will help testing newbies and veterans alike. </p>
<p>Based on the Elemental Selenium guidance, our new Sauce School offering offers how-to tutorials and testing best practices for beginners and experienced automation engineers alike on topics such as Selenium, JavaScript and Java, with instructions for tools and test runners such as Mocha, JUnit, Jenkins, npm, Maven, Python, Pytest, and all things Sauce Labs.</p>
<h3>SOC2 compliance</h3>
<p>In December, we achieved <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/news/sauce-labs-completes-soc-2-type-2-certification-for-organization-wide-security-controls" rel="noopener">Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 Type 2 certification</a>, confirming that select company security processes, procedures, and controls have been formally evaluated and tested by an independent accounting and auditing firm and met the rigorous SOC 2 security standards. We’ve always been committed to security, and this is just further proof of that commitment. </p>
<h3>API testing </h3>
<p>We recently <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/news/sauce-labs-acquires-api-fortress-to-bolster-continuous-testing-platform-with-modern-api-testing-solution#:~:text=SAN%20FRANCISCO%20%E2%80%93%20December%2010%2C%202020,for%20agile%20and%20DevOps%20teams." rel="noopener">acquired API Fortress</a>, a leading provider of modern API testing solutions for agile and DevOps teams. This is a huge milestone for us and we were happy to welcome the API Fortress team to the Sauce Labs lineup. Adding API Fortress to our product offering means we will be able to offer customers a richer and more complete continuous testing experience that includes API testing, visual end-to-end testing, and front-end performance testing to go along with the functional UI testing that Sauce Labs is already known for.</p>
<p>We hope that 2021 is filled with even more firsts, and that we’ll be able to enjoy them in person.  In the meantime, we wish you good health and as always… happy testing! </p>
