					<description><![CDATA[From online retail to finance, and from streaming entertainment to healthcare providers and agencies, all manner of businesses and government entities have]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>From online retail to finance, and from streaming entertainment to healthcare providers and agencies, all manner of businesses and government entities have seen their web traffic and app activity explode. COVID-19 has changed everything for many organizations, and it did so overnight, with no time to prepare.</p>
<p>Microsoft says the use of its Teams collaboration software in Italy <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/03/31/microsoft_corrects_cloud_surge_claim/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">increased by 775% in March alone</a>, sending the company scrambling to increase capacity while implementing <a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/update-2-on-microsoft-cloud-services-continuity/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">temporary restrictions and quotas</a> for Azure customers to prevent systems from going offline.</p>
<p>While performance is increasingly being considered during the software design phase, more typically <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-engineering-critical?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">performance engineering </a><a target="_blank" href="http://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-engineering-critical?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">is an iterative process</a> that occurs after a service or app has been launched. If the system is bogging down due to heavy load, engineers figure out <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-engineering-techniques?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">what they can do to make it better</a>, whether that&#8217;s redesigning code through component decoupling or simply deploying cloud services such as caching systems and content delivery networks. Performance improves, and everyone relaxes.</p>
<p>But enterprises such as Instacart, Zoom, Amazon, and Netflix just don&#8217;t have the luxury of time in the new COVID-19 reality. Last month, <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/netflix-streaming-hits-all-time-highs-coronavirus-1203543218/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Netflix usage</a> hit its all-time high, and it&#8217;s still going up. Analysts and users alike are increasingly worried whether it and other Internet services <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/05/should-netflix-fear-crashes-in-a-high-traffic-time.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">can handle the load</a>.</p>
<p>So far, they&#8217;ve been able to, through a combination of savvy business decisions and clever engineering. TechBeacon spoke with several tech leaders to suss out the best practices that were keeping these types of services afloat amid the huge—and sudden—crush of activity, and what other organizations can learn from how they&#8217;re coping.</p>
<p>Here are four best practices from the front lines of <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-testing-to-engineering?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">performance engineering</a>.</p>

Plus: Get this report: <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-engineering-devops-gartner?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adopt a Performance Engineering Approach for DevOps</a> ]</em></p>
<h3>1. Embrace simplicity</h3>
<p>James Pulley, co-host of the performance testing podcast <a target="_blank" href="https://www.perfbytes.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">PerfBytes</a>, harkens back to another event that changed much overnight. During 9/11, the major online news organizations &#8220;had to move to a highly simplified web page because they were getting so much traffic,&#8221; he said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;They got rid of fancy graphics to reduce the number of bytes they were sending. Today, the same strategy is being employed at a Netflix level, reducing bit rates at the top end.&#8221; <br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/perfpulley" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">James Pulley</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure enough, the company has <a target="_blank" href="https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/reducing-netflix-traffic-where-its-needed" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">voluntarily cut its bandwidth usage</a> in Europe. This doesn&#8217;t just help keep streaming from overloading public networks, but it also helps Netflix servers avoid a meltdown.</p>
<p>Byte creep is a real problem, Pulley said. The <a target="_blank" href="https://speedcurve.com/blog/web-performance-page-bloat/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">average size of a web page</a> grew from about 1MB in 2011 to 3MB in 2017, and it&#8217;s still on the rise. As such, the first step organizations need to take to weather a traffic crush is to cut the fat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If you have six web beacons, go to one. If you have a style sheet full of artifacts, get all of that out.&#8221;<br />—James Pulley</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use Minify and Zip where possible; you want the data you send to be as small as it can be. And make sure your cache model is refined and working. If you see a file that hasn&#8217;t changed in five years that&#8217;s still being requested every five days, &#8220;you&#8217;re wasting bandwidth,&#8221; he added. Finally, be more aggressive about returning resources to the pool by giving shorter sessions to users.</p>
<h3>2. Treat data like code</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-yeh-7339897/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Matt Yeh</a>, senior director of product marketing at DataOps platform vendor Delphix, said that one way to scale your development cycles to handle increased demand is by focusing on agility in the data tier. This means getting teams to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/want-effective-test-automation-devops-manage-your-test-data" rel="noopener noreferrer">treat data the same way they treat code</a>.</p>
<p>Feeding and refreshing test data for cloud-based test environments from an on-premises production instance &#8220;is harder than many leaders think,&#8221; he said. Without the ability to automate data delivery as part of a DevOps workflow in the cloud, &#8220;a data agility problem is created that drives bad behavior and slows the delivery pipeline.&#8221;</p>
<p>Data agility is the most important factor for application development, because while code is being built and deployed via self-service, &#8220;the data tier still remains rigid and resistant to the same level of speed and automation at most organizations,&#8221; Yeh said.</p>
<p>Make your tools and processes address the data tier in the same way teams have improved the flow of their application code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;You can eliminate data-related waste, rework, and wait times.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-yeh-7339897/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Matt Yeh</a></p>

<h3>3. Take a &#8216;shift-left&#8217; approach to quality</h3>
<p>The Rule of 10 says that after each step of quality assurance, it is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.design4manufacturability.com/DFM_article.htm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">10 times harder and more expensive to fix a defect</a>. To address this, said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/weisstal?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tal Weiss</a>, CTO of software quality tool vendor OverOps, many organizations are starting to understand the merits of adopting a shift-left approach to quality.</p>
<p>This means that by increasing quality measures taken in the development and testing phases of software delivery, you can <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/shift-your-testing-how-increase-quality-not-anxiety" rel="noopener noreferrer">significantly reduce the odds of production issues</a>. This mindset can be applied to the data tier as much as it can be to code.</p>
<h3>4. Embrace performance engineering tools</h3>
<p>&#8220;Performance engineering and testing doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to change, but it definitely needs to happen,&#8221; said Guillaume Quintard, software engineer for content delivery network vendor Varnish Software.</p>
<p>Performance engineering teams need to understand where their breaking point is and have a proactive plan in place for what to do when it is reached to avoid an outage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;As an industry, we&#8217;ve had these tools for a long time.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/gquintard_?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Guillaume Quintard</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mike Canney, business development and product strategy professional at performance analytics tool vendor Accedian, expanded on that thought. Performance engineering teams typically have a very good understanding from a systems perspective, but &#8220;what&#8217;s missing is a real understanding of the network and application visibility,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>To get a complete picture of network performance, you have to understand things like bandwidth and latency, he said. &#8220;You need to be able to see how having multiple users impacts bandwidth, and how much bandwidth and latency impacts response time.&#8221; </p>
<p>Canney also noted that sheer bandwidth isn&#8217;t always the issue. There are many variables that can affect a network.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Before you throw money at expanding bandwidth, make sure that&#8217;s actually the problem by utilizing network visibility tools.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/mikecanney" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mike Canney</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Other factors to weigh</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to understand business transactions—measuring the unit of work that is actually performed in each transaction. For example, a single search on a retail website may ultimately create thousands of micro-transactions as the item is located, inventory is measured, the offering of upsells or related goods is weighed, and so on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Once you understand the business transactions and what goes into them, it&#8217;s much easier to do network modeling and predictive analysis.&#8221;<br />—Mike Canney</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, all organizations need to take a long-term approach to performance engineering. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Testing is more relevant than ever, but relying on traditional tests is no longer an option.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/weisstal?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tal Weiss</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Building in automated quality gates and feedback loops will allow for thorough, fast testing that doesn&#8217;t hold up release timelines. This can be done by leveraging a variety of automated testing methods within your CI/CD pipeline, such as static and dynamic code analysis.</p>
<h3>Process and procedure trump everything</h3>
<p>Goutham Belliappa, vice president of AI engineering at Capgemini, sums up the matter by noting that the overarching issue surrounding traffic surges is not usually a technical one but a human one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;COVID-19 has forced many companies to go digital, even those that thought they were unable to. For many businesses, bandwidth is being slammed, but the problem is more of a process and procedure one.&#8221; <br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/GBELLIAP" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Goutham Belliappa</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, VPNs hastily rolled out to workers who were never envisioned as working from home have only exacerbated problems for IT departments that also are no longer in the office.</p>
<p>The bottom line: The tools needed to weather the storm are already in most organizations&#8217; collective arsenals, but development teams need to more fully utilize them and better understand how the data tier <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-predictive-analytics-can-boost-app-performance" rel="noopener noreferrer">affects application performance</a>.</p>
<p>The good news is that it&#8217;s easy to take some smart first steps. Reducing data overhead and minimizing data transfer—even if it&#8217;s only temporary—are essential ones to keeping your services up and running during this crisis.</p>

<div id=""><picture class="single-article__img"><source media="(max-width: 899px)" data-lazy-srcset="https://testguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PerfGuildInTroublesTimes-575x360-c-default.png"></source></picture>
<p>As we enter the fifth month of the year I&#8217;m sure no one predicted the trouble times we would find ourselves in 2020.</p>
<p>More than a few companies were caught off guard by how COVID-19 impacted traffic to their websites.</p>
<p>The bad news is that some sites completely crashed due to the spike in traffic.</p>
<h2>Site Down Due to Performance Issues</h2>
<p>Image if Netflix went down for 24 hrs. Netflix usage has gone up a lot amid COVID-19, but how would you feel if you could not access it for 24 hrs due to performance issues?</p>
<p>This is what happened to the stock trading app, <a target="_blank" href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robinhood</a>. Recently, it went down for 24 hours during what was probably one of the stock market&#8217;s most significant swings—costing their users millions of dollars.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RobinHood?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener noreferrer">#RobinHood</a> bunch of crooks. Can’t sell my positions… for last hour.

</blockquote>
<p>The reason for this significant outage?</p>
<p>Due to a surge in traffic, their system struggled with unprecedented load and crashed.</p>

<h2>Why Performance Engineering Matters</h2>
<p>How many users and how much long-term revenue do you think Robinhood lost because of bad performance?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Wow, it’s crazy <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener noreferrer">@RobinhoodApp</a> has been down on both it’s app and website. Can’t close opened positions. I swear the last time I use this app. This is not the First time this has happened . <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/robinhood?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener noreferrer">#robinhood</a> app crash</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Remember that top software engineering companies considers performance, not as a nice-to-have, but as a crucial feature of their products.</p>
<p>But most engineering teams don&#8217;t regularly test the performance and scalability of their applications &amp; infrastructure, and most lack the<br />tools or knowledge to do so correctly.</p>
<p>The good news is that this has only highlighted the importance of, and need for, more performance testing.</p>
<p>But how will your company approach their performance engineering as we move forward? Do you have a plan in place? Do you even know where to start?</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m excited to announce the opening of the third annual <a target="_blank" href="https://guildconferences.com/conferences/perfguild-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PerfGuild</a>.</p>
<p>I know what you’re thinking – not another online event <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>But Test Guild’s mission since <em>2017</em> has been to deliver the best of the conference experience, filled with actionable testing advice, all online.</p>
<p>This is not a pivot, a fad, or a second option for us — we have <strong>only </strong>done and will <strong>only do</strong> <em>online conferences</em> using our proven, guild-style community-driven platform.</p>
<p>You can trust us not to waste your time with a quickly-pulled-together, poorly run, online event.</p>
<p>We’ll be here for you long after all the craziness going on in the world with lockdowns and social distancing is over.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re bringing together some of the best experts in the world when it comes to performance testing.</p>
<p>During the conference, you&#8217;ll learn what works. More importantly, what doesn&#8217;t work for some of the top experts I could find to help you create or improve your performance engineering efforts.</p>
<p>Check out the Third Annual PerfGuild online conference, where some of the top performance-engineering experts in the industry will teach you what is working right now.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://guildconferences.com/conferences/perfguild-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to get your early-bird ticket at 50%</a>. (This offer expires May 5, after which the price will increase.)</p>
<p>At the @testguilds #perfguild20 you&#8217;ll discover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hybrid load testing using real browsers</li>
<li>Effective performance engineering</li>
<li>Leveraging your automation scripts for performance testing</li>
<li>A code-first approach to performance engineering</li>
<li>Java performance testing tips</li>
<li>How to add front-end performance to your SDLC</li>
<li>How to add distortion and variance to your performance tests to find black swan performance events caused by things like COVID-19</li>
<li>Much, much more</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why You Should Join This Online Performance Testing Event in 2020</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s what a few of our past PerfGuild attendees said about their experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Perf Guild has probably been the best training money I have ever spent in my 18 years with Deere and 15 years with the DoD.” – Randy Stevenson</p>
<p>“There was a lot of good info provided at a low cost. I&#8217;d definitely say its money well spent.”</p>
<p>“The format is great, you&#8217;ve nailed it! I like that I get the social aspect from home.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://guildconferences.com/conferences/perfguild-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click to learn more</a></p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll join us at PerfGuild and make the rest of 2020 as performant as possible.</p>

<p>In November 2019, 288 Selenium, Cypress, and WebdriverIO quality engineers spent a combined 1.5 years of time writing traditional and Visual AI tests against 5 common use cases.</p>
<p>In this webinar, we will reveal what they learned, and explain how you can apply these lessons in less than an hour to your own test suites and build Visual AI-driven test automation for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing UI elements using minimum locators, texts and labels</li>
<li>Data-driven testing and functional testing</li>
<li>Testing table sorting and filtering functionalities</li>
<li>Testing graphical displays such as bar-charts</li>
<li>Testing highly dynamic content</li>
</ul>
<p>Watch this webinar and see how Visual AI can radically improve your ability to author new tests faster, reduce test maintenance, and catch more early-stage bugs faster than ever before possible. </p>
