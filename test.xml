										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>Depending on your life experiences, the phrase (or country song by Eric Church) “two pink lines” may bring up a wide range of powerful emotions.    I suspect, like many fathers and expecting fathers, I will never forget the moment I found out my wife was pregnant.  You might recall what you were doing, or where you were and maybe even what you were thinking.   As a professional ethical hacker, I have been told many times – “You just think a little differently about things.”   I sure hope so, since that’s my day job and sure enough this experience wasn’t any different.  My brain immediately asked the question, “How am I going to ensure my family is protected from a wide range of cyberthreats?”   Having a newborn opens the door to all sorts of new technology and I would be a fool not to take advantage of all devices that makes parenting easier.   So how do we do this safely?</p>
<h2>The A-B -C ‘s</h2>
<p>The security industry has a well-known concept called the “principle of least privilege. “This simply means that you don’t give a piece of technology more permissions or access than it needs to perform its primary function.   This can be applied well beyond just technology that helps parents; however, for me it’s of extra importance when we talk about our kids.  One of the parenting classes I took preparing for our newborn suggested we use a baby tracking phone app.   This was an excellent idea, since I hate keeping track of anything on paper.  So I started looking at a few different apps for my phone and discovered one of them asked for permission to use “location services,” also known as GPS, along with access to my phone contacts.  This caused me to pause and ask: Why does an app to track my baby’s feeding schedule need to know where I am?  Why does it need to know who my friends are?   These are the types of questions parents should consider before just jumping into the hottest new app.  For me, I found a different, less popular app which has the same features, just with a little less access.</p>
<p>It’s not always as easy to just “find something else.”  In my house, “if momma ain’t happy, nobody is happy.”  So, when my wife decided on a specific breast pump that came with Bluetooth and is internet enabled, that’s the one she is going to use.   The app backs up all the usage data to a server in the cloud.   There are many ways that this can be accomplished securely, and it is not necessary a bad feature, but I didn’t feel this device benefited from being internet connected.   Therefore, I simply lowered its privileges by not allowing it internet access in the settings on her phone.  The device works perfectly fine, she can show the doctor the data from her phone, yet we have limited our online exposure and footprint just a little more.  This simple concept of least privilege can be applied almost everywhere and goes a long way to limiting your exposure to cyber threats.</p>
<h2>Peek-A-Boo</h2>
<p>I think one of the most sought after and used products for new parents is the baby monitor or baby camera.   As someone who has spent a fair amount of time hacking cameras <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/robot-character-analysis-reveals-trust-issues/" rel="noopener noreferrer">(or cameras on wheels)</a> this was a large area of concern for me.  Most cameras these days are internet connected and if not, you often lose the ability to view the feed on your phone, which is a huge benefit to parents.  So how, as parents, do we navigate this securely?  While there is no silver bullet here, there are a few things to consider.    For starters, there are still many baby cameras on the market that come with their own independent video screen.  They generally use Wi-Fi and are only accessible from home.  If this system works for you, use it.  It is always more secure to have a video system which is not externally accessible.   If you really want to be able to use your phone, consider the below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Where is the recorded video and audio data being stored? </strong>This may not seem important if the device is internet connected anyway, but it can be.  If your camera data is being stored locally (DVR, SD card, network storage, etc.), then an attacker would need to hack your specific device to obtain this information.   If you combine this with good security hygiene such as a strong password and keeping your device updated, an attacker has to work very hard to access your camera data.  If we look at the alternative where your footage is stored in the cloud, and it becomes subject to a security breach, now your camera’s video content is collateral damage.  Large corporations are specifically targeted by cybercriminals because they provide a high ROI for the time spent on the attack; an individual practicing good cybersecurity hygiene becomes a much more difficult target providing less incentive for the attacker, thus becoming a less likely target.</li>
<li><strong>Is the camera on the same network as the rest of your home? </strong>An often-overlooked security implication to many IoT devices, but especially cameras, is outside of the threat of spying, but rather the threat of a network entry point. If the camera itself is compromised it can be used as a pivot point to attack other devices on your network.  A simple way to reduce this risk is to utilize the “guest” network feature that comes by default on almost all home routers.   These guest networks are preset to be isolated from your main network and generally require little to no setup.  By simply attaching your cameras to your guest network, you can reduce the risk of a compromised camera leading a cybercriminal to the banking info on your laptop.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Background checks – Not only for babysitters</h2>
<p>Most parents, especially new ones, like to ensure that anyone that watches their children is thoroughly vetted.  There are a ton of services out there to do this for babysitters and nannies, however it’s not always as easy for vetting the companies that create the devices we put in our homes.  So how do we determine what is safe?  My father used to tell me: “It’s how we respond to our mistakes that makes the difference.”  When researching a company or device, should you find that the device has been found to have a vulnerability, often the response time and accountability from the vendor can tell you if it’s a company you should be investing in. Some things to look for include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was the vulnerability quickly patched?</li>
<li>Are there unpatched bugs still?</li>
<li>Has a vendor self-reported flaws, fixed them and reported to the public they have been fixed?</li>
<li>Are there numerous outstanding bugs filed against a company or device?</li>
<li>Does the company not recognize the possibility of bugs in their products?</li>
</ul>
<p>These answers can often be discovered on a company’s website or in release notes, which are generally attached to an update of a piece of software.   Take a minute to read the notes and see if the company is making security updates. You don’t need to understand all the details, just knowing they take security seriously enough to update frequently is important.  This can help tip the scales when deciding between devices or apps.</p>
<h2>Remember, you can do this!</h2>
<p>Through my preparation for becoming a new parent, I constantly read in books and was told by professionals, “Remember, you can do this!”  Cybersecurity in the context of being a parent is no different.  Every situation is different, and it is important to do what works with you and your family.  As parents, we shouldn’t be afraid to use all the cool new gadgets that are emerging on the market, but instead educate ourselves on how to limit our risk.  Which features do I need, which ones can I do without?   Remember always follow a vendor’s recommendations and best practices, and of course remember to breathe!</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way many businesses do business—for some, irrevocably. It&#8217;s also made them more aware of the need for resiliency and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cyber-resilience-tb/state-secops-beyond-soc?lx=dSbBFJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">the role cybersecurity must play in ensuring that an organization can continue</a> operations in the face of disruptive events.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are at an inflection point globally. The pandemic has affected us in ways that we never expected,&#8221; said Mark Fernandes, CTO of Micro Focus Security, at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/7477/451044?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="nofollow noopener">a recent digital &#8220;fireside chat&#8221; about cyber resiliency during, after, and beyond COVID-19</a>. And, he added, cybersecurity teams have been here before.</p>
<p>In 2001, there was SOX—Sarbanes-Oxley—which ushered in the era of compliance. Then in 2008, after a series of major cyber attacks, there was the era of threat management, as organizations began to recognize the potential damage cyber attacks could inflict on infrastructure and supply chains. In 2014, digital transformation began to gain steam and cybersecurity became about industry alignment with it.</p>
<p>Now, in 2020, another one of those watershed moments has arrived. If you look at the use of digital assets before 2020, they weren&#8217;t mainstays being used at scale, Fernandes explained. Now, with everyone from educators to healthcare workers using digital tools, that&#8217;s not the case anymore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m working with a government in another part of the world where they&#8217;ve actually said that 60% of their government desks are going to move to digital desks using chatbots and other types of tools.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbfernandes/" rel="nofollow noopener">Mark Fernandes</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are the key lessons from the expert chat on <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cyber-resilience-tb/cyber-resilience-get-started?lx=dSbBFJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">cyber resilience now and in the future</a>. </p>
<h2>1. Broaden your approach to resilience</h2>
<p>A recurring issue among organizations has been distinguishing between cybersecurity and cyber resiliency.</p>
<p>TMX Group CISO Bobby Singh, who joined Fernandes during the online event, explained that cyber resiliency is being able to deliver critical business services when a negative security event is taking place. It&#8217;s the ability to be nimble and agile, while building modularity into your architecture.</p>
<p>Some organizations believe that their disaster recovery plans cover their resiliency needs. That&#8217;s not the case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Resiliency goes way beyond just being a [disaster recovery plan].&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/singhbobby/" rel="nofollow noopener">Bobby Singh</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It goes beyond business continuity plans (BCP), too.</p>
<p>Singh explained that when businesses do a BCP, they assume that anywhere from 10% to 50% of their staff will still be onsite to perform operations. That wasn&#8217;t the case when COVID-19 began to spread. &#8220;During the March pandemic,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;it was just literally 99% of the people that were offsite.&#8221;</p>
<h2>2. It does not happen overnight</h2>
<p>TMX provides services to the global financial community, which has weathered the pandemic better than a lot of other industries, such as retail and hospitality. &#8220;You were able to do your banking pretty well, paid your bills online, and did whatever transactions you wanted to do,&#8221; Singh said.</p>
<p>That kind of resiliency, though, isn&#8217;t accomplished overnight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;That journey took a long time to get to March. It didn&#8217;t happen in 2020.&#8221;<br />—Bobby Singh</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We as a financial sector have been thinking about the use of the cloud. We&#8217;ve been thinking about multiple data centers,&#8221; Singh said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been thinking about spreading our resources and key staff across regions so if one region is down, the other one can come up. Those things were fundamentally ingrained into the financial sector.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that to achieve that kind of resiliency, a business needs to understand its full value chain. It has to know how its business services get to its clients or customers and what that entails, as well as how diversified its suppliers are.</p>
<p>And testing multiple scenarios is key. &#8220;It takes time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It consumes critical resources to test. But it&#8217;s quite evident by what happened in March of 2020, for example, that testing is pretty critical.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another participant in the online event, Christina Richmond, program vice president for security services at IDC, said that organizations should make sure they have a playbook and a plan and that the plan is practiced with stakeholders. &#8220;And make sure you include stakeholders across the entire business,&#8221; she advised.</p>
<p>To be resilient, she continued, an organization needs to include a broad set of stakeholders from across the business. &#8220;It&#8217;s a team sport.&#8221;</p>
<h2>3. Prepare for the &#8216;next normal&#8217;</h2>
<p>Richmond explained that during the first stage of the pandemic, many businesses were scrambling to enhance their network capacity <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/adapting-post-pandemic-world-tb/pandemic-your-remote?lx=V3y1kl" rel="noopener">to accommodate remote workers</a>.</p>
<p>After dealing with initial capacity issues, they moved on to capacity optimization, she said. They continued enhancing their network capacity and remote working capabilities, as well as looking at how to secure people working from home. They also started to consider recovery.</p>
<p>Finally, they started to look at resiliency and how they could prepare for the future. That <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-pandemic?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener">accelerated migration to the cloud and digital transformation</a>. &#8220;Companies are changing rapidly to embrace cloud in a way that they never thought they would, even if they were on that path to embrace cloud,&#8221; Richmond said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re embracing digital business in ways that they never thought they would. Suddenly, it was an urgent necessity.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinarichmond/" rel="nofollow noopener">Christina Richmond</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now bitten by the digital bug, as organizations move toward the &#8220;next normal,&#8221; they&#8217;re going to spend more aggressively, she predicted. And they are going to start to innovate again, she said. &#8220;They&#8217;ll focus on technologies that advance their digital capabilities in ways that they really didn&#8217;t think about before. Or if they had thought about it before, they&#8217;re accelerating those plans.&#8221;</p>
<h3>4. It takes the right team</h3>
<p>As digital transformation takes hold in more and more companies, resiliency will play an important role in securing business operations. But resiliency will require manpower, which seems to be in short supply these days.</p>
<p>There are millions of jobs open in cyber security globally, said Singh.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to fill them by hiring propeller heads or coders or developers or people in network security. We&#8217;ve got to broaden the horizon.&#8221;<br />—Bobby Singh</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key to solving the cyber-security talent storage is looking for people beyond STEM, added Richmond.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;They think differently. They&#8217;re asking different questions. They&#8217;re coming from that out-of-the-box perspective.&#8221;<br />—Christina Richmond</p>
</blockquote>

He leaves behind a legacy of courage, strength, perseverance, and a life-long dedication to pursuing a fair and just world. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />

<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>Typically, the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) gives us a sense of where technology is going in the future. However, this year’s show was arguably more about technology catching up with how the COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped our lives. While gathering in person was not an option, we still had the opportunity to witness incredible technological feats virtually – primarily those meant to help us better adapt to the new normal.<br />From devices aimed at making the world more sanitary to new work-from-home solutions, here are some of the highlights from this year’s first ever virtual CES:</p>
<h3>Extreme Home Makeover: Digital Edition</h3>
<p>Every year, CES introduces a plethora of smart home devices aimed at making our lives easier. But now that our homes have expanded beyond where we live to function as a workplace and classroom, companies have developed new gadgets to improve our lives while we stay at home. In fact, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/12/tech/ces-2021-pandemic-tech/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">smart home market</a> grew 6.7% from 2019 to 2020 to $88 billion and is expected to reach <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-smart-homes-market-industry" rel="noopener noreferrer">$246.42 billion by 2025.</a></p>
<p>This year, Kohler showed off voice control features for its sinks and other fixtures, so homeowners can turn on faucets without touching them. And while every CES is paved with an array of flashy new TVs, LG drummed up lots of excitement with its new 55-inch transparent TV that you can see through when it’s turned off.</p>
<p>From monitors to keyboards and Wi-Fi upgrades to charging stations, plenty of the gadgets coming out of this year’s show were designed to improve the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gearpatrol.com/tech/a35181210/best-desktop-accessories-ces-2021/" rel="noopener noreferrer">remote work experience</a>. Take Dell’s UltraSharp 40-inch Curved Ultrawide U4021QW Monitor, for example. Ultrawide is the functional equivalent of two 4K monitors side-by-side, but without the seam. Belkin and Satechi also brought their latest charging stations to CES 2021 to improve the home office, allowing users to charge multiple devices at once. With so many companies creating innovative devices to make our work-from-home lives more manageable in the long run, it’s clear that remote work is likely here to stay.</p>
<h3>Staying Healthy at Home in Global Health Crisis</h3>
<p>CES 2021 also brought us a whole new lineup of technology designed to help us monitor our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/pictures/the-health-tech-of-ces-2021/3/" rel="noopener noreferrer">health at home</a>. Fluo Labs debuted Flō, a device that stops your body from releasing histamines when pollen, dust, and other allergens enter your body. HD Medical also introduced HealthyU, a device smaller than a GoPro that includes a seven-lead ECG, a temperature sensor, a pulse oximeter, microphones to record heart and lung sounds, a heart rate monitor, and a blood pressure sensor. HealthyU is designed for people with heart issues to keep tabs on their health every day and send that information to their doctors remotely. Not only will these devices enable us to take better care of ourselves if we can’t physically go to a doctor’s office, but they will also enhance our awareness of ourselves and our loved ones.</p>
<h3>Touchless Tech is on the Rise</h3>
<p>In 2020, we became hyper-aware of germs and how they can easily spread – one of those ways being on digital devices. While disinfecting these surfaces with an alcohol solution can help, many look to taking a different approach to avoid germ-spreading: touchless technology.</p>
<p>While no <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/ces-2021-showcases-tech-to-fight-back-against-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer">one technolog</a>y can win the battle against the virus, many companies are doing their part to promote a cleaner, healthier future. For example, Plott built a doorbell called the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2021/Honorees/E/Ettie.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ettie</a> that can take people’s temperature before they’re allowed to enter. Another company, Alarm.com, created a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/alarm-com-touchless-video-doorbell-ces-2021-rings-itself-so-your-hands-stay-clean/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Touchless Video Doorbell</a> to cut down on the transmission of bacteria and viruses that we otherwise often leave on places we touch. Kohler also built a toilet that flushes with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/kohler-ces-2021-bathroom-designs-include-touchless-toilet-16000-dollar-bathtub/" rel="noopener noreferrer">wave of a hand</a>. As we head further into 2021 and beyond, be on the lookout for more voice-activated and touchless devices to help slow the spread of germs and help us live our lives free from worry.</p>
<h3>Adapt to the Cybersecurity Landscape in a Hyper-Connected World</h3>
<p>We’ve become more reliant on technology than ever before to stay connected with loved ones from afar, work from home without missing a beat, participate in distance learning, and find new forms of digital entertainment. But with this increase in time spent online comes a greater risk of cyberthreats, and we must stay vigilant when it comes to protecting our online safety. Hackers continue to adapt their techniques to take advantage of users spending more time online, so we must educate and protect ourselves and our devices from emerging threats. This way, we can continue to embrace new technologies, while we live our digital lives free from worry.</p>
