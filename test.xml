<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Though 2020 is coming to an end, companies will continue to adjust to the events of the year, with ripples spreading out into every facet of business operations. The distribution of a vaccine will likely bring the year&#8217;s most noteworthy event, the coronavirus pandemic, to an eventual end, but one <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/adapting-post-pandemic-world-tb/pandemic-your-remote?lx=V3y1kl" rel="noopener noreferrer">impact of the pandemic</a>—a major increase in remote work—is likely here to stay.</p>
<p>For cybersecurity, both the pandemic and remote work have created challenges. This past year, driven by keen interest in every development related to the pandemic, COVID-themed phishing lures have taken off, and a variety of bad actors have used information on topics such as vaccine research to get inside systems. Meanwhile, remote work has resulted in security researchers and attackers focusing on the necessary infrastructure—such as virtual private network (VPN) software—as a target of attack.</p>
<p>Many of those trends will continue into the new year, said Michael Sentonas, chief technology officer for CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity services firm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We see the threats going through the roof; a lot of the adversaries see this as a good opportunity. You have one dynamic which has a huge number of attacks &#8230; especially as people access applications from outside the organization far more often than they used to.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/michaelsentonas?lang=gu" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Michael Sentonas</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cybersecurity teams and security operation center (SOC) analysts <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/state-of-secops-tb/state-secops-202021-takeaways?lx=ipOpkU&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">have had to adapt to the various threats as well as working in a remote cybersecurity team as well</a>. With more cloud infrastructure, exposed VPN appliances, and harder-to-manage user systems, cybersecurity teams will have their work cut out for them in the next year, said Deepen Desai, CISO and vice president of security research at Zscaler, a cloud security company.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Users will continue to remain prime targets [of] cleverly crafted social engineering campaigns. The goal here is to perform credential theft or system compromise, which can then be leveraged to perform further attacks.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ddesai_av" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Deepen Desai</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are five trends SecOps pros need to prepare for in the new year.</p>
<h3>1. Debate over making ransomware payments illegal will heat up</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/ransomware-pandemic-getting-ridiculous" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ransomware has become the de facto standard</a> for cyber criminals to make money from compromises. In the past, desperate companies have often chosen to pay the ransom, but that may cease to be an option in the future.</p>
<p>As a matter of public policy, the most effective way to take on ransomware is to prohibit victims from paying the ransom. The United States may be moving to take that approach, using laws to sanction criminal and terrorist organizations. In October, the US Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) clarified that paying ransom to a sanctioned group could result in penalties against the company making the payment.</p>
<p>Companies that facilitate ransomware payments to cyber actors on behalf of victims, including financial institutions, cyber insurance firms, and companies involved in digital forensics and incident response, not only encourage future ransomware payment demands but also may risk violating OFAC regulations.</p>
<p>The notice highlights that companies may not have an option in the future to pay ransoms to perpetrators—the cyber criminals and nation-state hackers behind ransomware. Expect the debate to heat up, said CrowdStrike&#8217;s Sentonas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The fastest way to kill this as a problem is to effectively mandate that no one can pay these people. But the counter-argument is that you are punishing the victim, because the risk is, if you have an organization who can&#8217;t recover, what options do they have?&#8221;<br />—Michael Sentonas</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2. Shadow IT rises again due to remote work</h3>
<p>Information technology that flies under the radar of the IT department has raised significant issues for companies. Often such technology—whether a wireless router, a development server, or a cloud application—is not well maintained by the employee who installed it, leaving a potential security issue.</p>
<p>A decade ago, the most significant threat was likely a rogue Wi-Fi access point. A few years ago, cloud storage and cloud applications became the greatest risk for most organizations. Now, with a large portion of the office workforce working remotely, their home devices have become the latest shadow-IT attack surface, said Yassir Abousselham, chief information security officer for Splunk.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/state-of-secops-tb/essential-guide-ai-soc?lx=ipOpkU&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">Security organizations will need to keep an eye on new technologies,</a> with a focus on shadow IT, as everyone faces new challenges during and coming out of the pandemic, Abousselham said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Attackers will continue relying on the same tactics with preference for the easiest path to achieving compromise, [whether that is] weak passwords, open public cloud storage, [or some other technical issue.]&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ayassir?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Yassir Abousselham</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies should invest in basic security hygiene, focus on automated security measures and checks, and enable stakeholders to take part in the security program, he said.</p>
<h3>3. Less access to packet data hinders network monitoring</h3>
<p>While preventing breaches is still Plan A for most companies, detecting a breach before the attacker can do significant damage is key to preventing some of the worst forms of cyber attack, including ransomware. Monitoring the network for anomalous activity is a key part of the approach, but the adoption of more cloud services as part of business infrastructure means that more traffic will be encrypted and difficult to monitor for threats, said Mike Hamilton, the former CISO for the city of Seattle and the co-founder and CISO of cybersecurity firm CI Security.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Attackers are looking to steal data or do damage, so they have to go deep into the network, and that is the opportunity [for defenders] to see their signal. But problematically, we are going to have less and less access to packet data because pervasive encryption is continuing to be rolled out. And the criminals, of course, are using encryption more as well, so it becomes more about the metadata.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seattlemkh/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mike Hamilton</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analysts should develop more visibility and alerts based on metadata and not indicators of compromise that may no longer be visible, he said.</p>
<h3>4. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) becomes ubiquitous</h3>
<p>With the movement of many business processes and applications to cloud services, the single most effective countermeasure to protect corporate data and infrastructure is incorporating a second, or third or fourth, factor of authentication.</p>
<p>With remote work expected to continue, incorporating MFA into every facet of infrastructure is increasingly important, said Mick Baccio, cybersecurity advisor at Splunk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Many employees either don’t think about security on a day-to-day basis, or they actively make decisions that prioritize convenience over secure processes. That just can’t happen in a work-from-home world, so security leaders are now playing catch-up.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nohackme?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mick Baccio</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>5. The United States unfetters its response to nation-state hacking</h3>
<p>A bevy of new regulations for cybersecurity will continue to arrive, from requirements for more secure Internet of Things hardware to greater privacy expectations from states such as California. However, the government is also focused on finding ways to cause pain to attackers.</p>
<p>The Cyberspace Solarium Commission report advocated for a more aggressive policy of targeting cyber-attack groups with the aim of making their efforts more difficult. The Trump Administration and the US military adopted this policy, dubbed Defend Forward, as a way to &#8220;preempt threats, defeat ongoing harm, and deter future harm&#8221; from malicious actors and nation-states in cyberspace on a daily and an ongoing basis, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/due-diligence-and-us-defend-forward-cyber-strategy" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a paper by the Hoover Institution</a>.</p>
<p>Most notably used in the run-up to the presidential election to blunt foreign-sponsored disinformation, the policy doctrine could help companies by engaging cyber threats before they become more serious, said CI Security&#8217;s Hamilton.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a country is full of threat actors engaged in crime against us, we need to hit them in the economy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We need to drop all the legitimate business traffic to that country. The Trump Administration has just scratched the service on this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hamilton sees greater cooperation between government and business to fend off larger cyber threats, such as China&#8217;s industrial espionage and North Korea&#8217;s financial attacks.</p>
<h3>Cyber resilience comes of age</h3>
<p>Overall, cybersecurity organizations should expect more mature policies in 2021. At the same time, they may have more responsibilities, including increased requirements to protect data to fewer options in dealing with ransomware.</p>
<p>The post-pandemic world will see bigger shifts for security teams, such as the move from a cybersecurity approach to that of broader cyber resilience. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbfernandes?originalSubdomain=ca" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mark Fernandes</a>, CTO for security at Micro Focus, wrote recently that <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cyber-resilience-tb/state-secops-beyond-soc?lx=dSbBFJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">it&#8217;s time for the traditional SOC to evolve </a>into an &#8220;integrated threat operations center,&#8221; or ITOC.</p>
<p>He urges SecOps teams to welcome the use of technologies such as AI, ML, and automation, so that your team can focus on what matters.

					<description><![CDATA[Government and Private Sector organizations are transforming their businesses by embracing DevOps principles, microservice design patterns, and container technologies across]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div></div>
<p>Government and Private Sector organizations are transforming their businesses by embracing DevOps principles, microservice design patterns, and container technologies across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments. Container adoption is becoming mainstream to drive digital transformation and business growth and to accelerate product and feature velocity. Companies have moved quickly to embrace cloud native applications and infrastructure to take advantage of cloud provider systems and to align their design decisions with cloud properties of scalability, resilience, and security first architectures. The declarative nature of these systems enables numerous advantages in application development and deployment, like faster development and deployment cycles, quicker bug fixes and patches, and consistent build and monitoring workflows. These streamlined and well controlled design principles in automation pipelines lead to faster feature delivery and drive competitive differentiation.</p>
<p>As more enterprises adapt to cloud-native architectures and embark on multi-cloud strategies, demands are changing usage patterns, processes, and organizational structures. However, the unique methods by which application containers are created, deployed, networked, and operated present unique challenges when designing, implementing, and operating security systems for these environments. They are ephemeral, often too numerous to count, talk to each other across nodes and clusters more than they communicate with the outside endpoints, and they are typically part of fast-moving continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Additionally, development toolchains and operations ecosystems continue to present new ways to develop and package code, secrets, and environment variables. Unfortunately, this also compounds supply chain risks and presents an ever-increasing attack surface.</p>
<p>Lack of a comprehensive container security strategy or often not knowing where to start can be a challenge to effectively address risks presented in these unique ecosystems. While teams have recognized the need to evolve their security toolchains and processes to embrace automation, it is imperative for them to integrate specific security and compliance checks early into their respective DevOps processes. There are legitimate concerns that persist about miscon­figurations and runtime risks in cloud native applications, and still too few organizations have a robust security plan in place.</p>
<p>These complex problem definitions have led to the development of a special publication from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) – NIST SP 800-190 Application Security Container Guide. It provides guidelines for securing container applications and infrastructure components, including sectional review of the fundamentals of containers, key risks presented by core components of application container technologies, countermeasures, threat scenario examples, and actionable information for planning, implementing, operating, and maintaining container technologies.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/mvision-cnapp.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">MVISION Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP)</a> is a comprehensive device-to-cloud security platform for visibility and control across SaaS, PaaS, &amp; IaaS platforms.  It provides deep coverage on cloud native security controls that can be implemented throughout the entire application lifecycle. By mapping all the applicable risk elements and countermeasures from Sections 3 and 4 of NIST SP 800-190 to capabilities within the platform, we want to provide an architectural point of reference to help customers and industry partners automate compliance and implement security best practices for containerized application workloads. This mapping and a detailed review of platform capabilities aligned with key countermeasures can be referenced <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/white-papers/wp-container-security-strategy-nist-sp.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>As outlined in one of the supporting charts in the whitepaper, CNAPP has capabilities that effectively address all the risk elements described in the NIST special publication guidance.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-115099 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1.png" alt="" width="977" height="581" /></p>
<p>While the breadth of coverage is critical, it is worth noting that the most effective way to secure containerized applications requires embedding security controls into each phase of the container lifecycle. If we leverage Department of Defense’s Enterprise DevSecOps Reference Design guidance as a point of reference, it describes the DevSecOps lifecycle in terms of nine transition stages comprising of plan, develop, build, test, release, deliver, deploy, operate, and monitor.</p>
<figure id="attachment_115102" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-115102" style="width: 977px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-115102 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2.png" alt="" width="977" height="372" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-115102" class="wp-caption-text">DevSecOps Software Lifecycle: Referenced in DoD Enterprise DevSecOps Reference Design v1.0 Guidance</figcaption></figure>
<p>The foundational principle of DevSecOps implementations is that the software development lifecycle is not a monolithic linear process.  The “big bang” style delivery of the Waterfall SDLC process is replaced with small but more frequent deliveries, so that it is easier to change course as necessary. Each small delivery is accomplished through a fully automated process or semi-automated process with minimal human intervention to accelerate continuous integration and delivery. The DevSecOps lifecycle is adaptable and has many feedback loops for continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Specific to containerized applications and workloads, a more abstract view of a container’s lifecycle spans across three high-level phases of <strong>Build</strong>, <strong>Deploy</strong>, and <strong>Run</strong>.</p>
<h2>Build</h2>
<p>The “<strong>Build</strong>” phase centers on what ends up inside the container images in terms of the components and layers that make up an application. Usually created by the developers, security efforts are typically focused on reducing business risk later in the container lifecycle by applying best practices and identifying and eliminating known vulnerabilities early. These assessments can be conducted in an “inner” loop iteratively as developers perform incremental builds and add security linting and automated tests or can be driven via an “outer” feedback loop that’s driven by operational security reviews and penetration testing efforts.</p>
<h2>Deploy</h2>
<p>In the “<strong>Deploy</strong>” phase, developers configure containerized applications for deployment into production. Context grows beyond information about images to include details about configuration options available for orchestrated services. Security efforts in this phase often center around complying with operational best practices, applying least-privilege principles, and identifying misconfigurations to reduce the likelihood and impact of potential compromises.</p>
<h2>Runtime</h2>
<p>“<strong>Runtime</strong>” is broadly classified as a separate phase wherein containers go into production with live data, live users, and exposure to networks that could be internal or external in nature. The primary purpose of implementing security during the runtime phase is to protect running applications as well as the underlying container infrastructure by finding and stopping malicious actors in real time.</p>
<figure id="attachment_115105" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-115105" style="width: 1012px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-115105 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3.png" alt="" width="1012" height="489" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-115105" class="wp-caption-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/containerized-lifecycle/docker-application-lifecycle/containers-foundation-for-devops-collaboration" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker containerized application life cycle.</a> </figcaption></figure>
<p>By applying this understanding of container lifecycle stages to respective countermeasures that can be implemented and audited upon within MVISION Cloud, CNAPP customers can establish an optimal security posture and achieve synergies of shift left and runtime security models.   Security assessments are critically important early in planning and design, where important decisions are made about architecture approach, development tooling and technology platforms and where mistakes or misunderstandings can be dangerous and expensive. As DevOps teams move their workloads into the cloud, security teams will need to implement best practices that apply operations, monitoring and runtime security controls across public, private, and hybrid cloud consumption models.</p>
<p>CNAPP first discovers all the cloud-native components mapped to an application, including hosts, IaaS/PaaS services, containers, and the orchestration context that a container operates within.  With the use of native tagging and network flow log analysis, customers can visualize cloud infrastructure interactions including across compute, network, and storage components. Additionally, the platform scans cloud native object and file stores to assess presence of any sensitive data or malware. Depending on the configuration compliance of the underlying resources and data sensitivity, an aggregate risk score is computed per application which provides detailed context for an application owner to understand risks and prioritize mitigation efforts.</p>
<p>As a cloud security posture management platform, CNAPP provides a set of capabilities that ensure that assets comply with industry regulations, best practices, and security policies. This includes proactive scanning for vulnerabilities in container images and VMs and ensuring secure container runtime configurations to prevent non-compliant builds from being pushed to production.  The same principles apply to orchestrator configurations to help secure how containers get deployed using CI/CD tools. These baseline checks can be augmented with other policy types to ensure file integrity monitoring and configuration hardening of hosts (e.g., no insecure ports or unnecessary services), which help apply defense-in-depth by minimizing the overall attack surface.</p>
<p>Finally, the platform enforces policy-based immutability on running container instances (and hosts) to help identify process-, service-, and application-level whitelists. By leveraging the declarative nature of containerized workloads, threats can be detected during the runtime phase, including any exposure created as a result of misconfigurations, application package vulnerabilities, and runtime anomalies such as execution of reverse shell or other remote access tools. While segmentation of workloads can be achieved in the build and deploy phases of a workload using posture checks for constructs like namespaces, network policies, and container runtime configurations to limit system calls, the same should also be enforced in the runtime phase to detect and respond to malicious activity in an automated and scalable way.  The platform defines baselines and behavioral models that can specially be effective to investigate attempts at network reconnaissance, remote code execution due to zero-day application library and package vulnerabilities, and malware callbacks.  Additionally, by mapping these threats and incidents to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/cloud-security/introducing-mitre-attck-in-mvision-cloud-defend-with-precision/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a> tactics and techniques, it provides a common taxonomy to cloud security teams regardless of the underlying cloud application or an individual component. This helps them extend their processes and security incident runbooks to the cloud, including their ability to remediate security misconfigurations and preemptively address all the container risk categories outlined in NIST 800-190.</p>

<h3><strong>Culture and leadership</strong></h3>
<h4>Business leaders will increasingly value DevOps, showing that the work of the DevOps enterprise community matters to the people who matter.</h4>
<p>One of the most amazing dynamics within the DevOps enterprise community is seeing business leaders co-presenting success stories with their technology leadership counterparts. For example, Ken Kennedy (executive vice president and president for Technology and Product at CSG) and Kimberly Johnson (chief operating officer at Fannie Mae) described the achievements of their technology leadership counterparts and why it was important to them. I expect this trend to continue, especially given how COVID-19 has accelerated the rate of digital disruption. I believe this bodes well for all of technology.<br /><em>— <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/RealGeneKim" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gene Kim</a>, author and founder of IT Revolution</em></p>
<h4><strong>Hybrid product teams will become a pillar of customer value delivery.</strong></h4>
<p>With the rise of hybrid (remote/in-office) product teams, upskilling and online training initiatives will expand. As the pressure continues to rise to sell products and services through e-commerce sites, apps, or SaaS solutions, the lines between product and engineering teams will rapidly blur, giving rise to cross-functional, multidisciplinary teams that must learn and grow together. Each member will need to develop a wider combination of process skills, soft skills, automation skills, functional knowledge, and business knowledge, while maintaining deep competency in their focus areas. Product and engineering teams will be measured on customer value delivered, rather than just features or products created. <br /><em>—<a target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/JayneGroll&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606243788660000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEfZETzbhas29XNzVJUFXk3Aino-Q" href="https://twitter.com/JayneGroll" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jayne Groll</a>, CEO of the DevOps Institute and author of the </em>2020 Upskilling Report</p>
<h4><strong>Corporate culture will transform as business leaders shift their focus to systems thinking, to drive strategic investments.</strong></h4>
<p>Business leaders faced the dilemma of knowing they need to improve time-to-market in order to remain competitive while on a limited budget. Millions of dollars have been spent on digital transformation, which (at best) has yielded local optimizations but not systemic business outcomes. This will drive a focus on applying systems thinking to first identify where and what types of investments will result in delivering desired business outcomes and then scaling these concepts across the organization.  <br /><em>—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carmendeardo/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Carmen DeArdo</a>, senior value stream management strategist, Tasktop Technologies</em></p>
<h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>
<div dir="ltr" style="margin:0px">
<div style="margin:0px">
<h4>CISOs will embrace DevSecOps methodologies.</h4>
<p>Cloud-native security will rise higher on the agenda for CISOs as their organizations embrace Kubernetes, serverless, and other cloud-native technologies. It’s a significant cultural shift to embed security within DevOps practices, but it’s necessary: Businesses are moving to the cloud so they can deliver new features quickly and at high frequency, and security teams need to embrace new tools and processes to ensure that these deployments are safe as well as fast.<br /><em>—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/lizrice" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Liz Rice</a>, vice president, open-source engineering, Aqua Security</em></p>
<h4><strong>Application security will no longer be an afterthought.</strong></h4>
<p>As more teams adopt the nimble iteration of DevOps, they won&#8217;t have time for a lengthy security testing cycle. That&#8217;s why 2021 will be the year when we officially bury the separate, after-the-fact model of software application security.</p>
<p>As 2021 progresses, more application teams will take full responsibility for their own security, with appropriate support from the security team. As responsibility and budgets shift, application teams will increasingly adopt a DevSecOps process, in which they fully leverage automation to maximize velocity, and develop a culture of continuous improvement that allows each team to tune and optimize its processes.<br /><em>—<a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-knudsen-b728256/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jonathan Knudsen</a>, senior security strategist, Synopsys</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<h4><strong>More developers will move to application security&#8217;s front lines.</strong></h4>
<p>As developers continue to migrate to the front lines of application security, more development teams will achieve measurably better security and productivity outcomes. By 2024, 40% of development teams will make it into the high-performer category, up from 25% today, demonstrating both high-velocity releases and strong security outcomes. The bad news is that adversaries will continue to outpace them when it comes to finding successful exploit paths to new vulnerabilities.<br /><em>—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/weekstweets" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Derek Weeks</a>, vice president and DevOps advocate at Sonatype, and co-founder of the All Day DevOps conference</em></p>
<h4><strong>DevOps teams will see the value of threat modeling through security partnerships.</strong></h4>
<p>Application and software security professionals have known about the value proposition of threat modeling for a decade. In 2021, we&#8217;ll see developers embracing threat modeling as security continues to cement existing partnerships and teaches developers to build threat models. DevOps is all about collaboration, and 2021 is the year for the security teams in big and small organizations to break down walls and change the security culture at scale.<br /><em>—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/edgeroute" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Chris Romeo</a>, CEO, principal consultant, and co-founder of Security Journey</em></p>
<h4><strong>The acceleration of cloud adoption during the pandemic will shift the software security landscape dramatically.</strong></h4>
<p>While DevOps represents a clear evolution in the way that software is built, delivered, and operated, the architecture, composition, and very definition of applications will continue to change rapidly, leading to a rethink of software security approaches. These dual pressures of delivery velocity and cloud transformation will have a big impact on software security.</p>
<p>To get ahead of cloud transformation, software security will evolve into a risk-based vulnerability management service that seeks to automate and orchestrate security services as part of the software build-and-delivery pipeline. Security teams will arm developers with “point of capture” tools and coaching to eliminate vulnerabilities during development and provide policy guardrails for enabling speed. Throughout the pipeline, orchestrated security services will automatically reinforce the policy guardrails and enable risk-based vulnerability management for overburdened, under-resourced security teams that are challenged to get in front of cloud adoption. This will result in an increased demand for API security, cloud application security, application security orchestration services, and consolidated, risk-based vulnerability management approaches to software risk reduction.<br /><em>—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/raidschmitt" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jason Schmitt,</a> general manager of the Synopsys Software Integrity Group</em></p>
<h4>Cybersecurity will move out of the dark ages as intelligent cybersecurity emerges.</h4>
<p>For years, both DevOps and security teams have struggled to implement security across ever-changing and complex environments. Today&#8217;s reactive approach to cybersecurity, with agent-based scanning and manual orchestration tools, has led to endless vulnerabilities. But in 2021, reactive security approaches will become a distant memory, part of an era that will come to be known as the &#8220;cybersecurity dark ages.&#8221; Cybersecurity in this new era will rely on intelligent machine-generated code that builds security, compliance and infrastructure in minutes.   </p>
<p>DevOps and security teams will use intelligence-based code solutions to automatically build secure infrastructure, replacing manual attempts to fix vulnerabilities. Teams won&#8217;t have to spend limited financial and personnel resources building secure infrastructures. Rather, the trend will use artificial intelligence and machine learning to build secure infrastructure. <br /><em>—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-azevedo-7031274/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lisa Azevedo</a>, founder and CEO of Containn </em></p>
<h3><strong>Analytics and automation</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Predictive DevOps will be the next transformation that will deliver business value.</strong></h4>
<p>This is about using AIOps techniques across the delivery chain to be more efficient in delivering continuous value improvements for the business. To achieve true value, DevOps teams will pivot toward monitoring the business instead of monitoring the application or infrastructure. As a consequence, many dev and ops organizations will realize that they do not have the right skill set to understand what really matters to the business—and the concept of BizDevOps will be born. Business people will become part of the team that delivers digital instead of being a consumer of digital.<br /><em>—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/larsrossen" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lars Rossen</a>, chief technology officer, Micro Focus</em></p>
<h4><strong>Autonomous DevOps automation will become the new normal.</strong></h4>
<p>DevOps will rely on more advanced and autonomous techniques to generate automated outputs across various stages and activities within the lifecycle. To that end, robotic process automation tools will invade the DevOps ecosystem and help with automation of manual and error-prone tasks for greater productivity. In addition, augmenting digital apps and automating end-to-end user flows and testing will become a reality in a codeless manner. This will allow teams to cut down their test automation time. Code reviews for better validation of post-code commits will also join standard unit testing and human code reviews. These will better enable the identification of more complex security, functionality, and performance issues.<br /><em>—<a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/ek121268" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Eran Kinsbruner</a>, chief evangelist for Perfecto, Perforce Software</em></p>
<h4><strong>Analytics techniques will be adopted at every step in the software development lifecycle to make smarter decisions.</strong> </h4>
<p>This will enable, for example, optimal business prioritization of backlog items to maximize customer satisfaction, effective testing validation to minimize risk through change impact assessment, and shorter time to resolve application problems through anomaly detection and proactive resolution. This will be enabled through analytical systems that will ingest big data across the value stream, including human and machine data, using a variety of analytics techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, NLP, etc.<br /><em>—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-conway-668ab11/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mark Conway</a>,<strong> </strong>director, Office of the CTO, Micro Focus</em></p>
<h3><strong>Operations management</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>DevOps will integrate with AIOps to provide seamless operational feedback, and automated bug fixes will remove most human involvement.   </strong></h4>
<p>Organizations will begin to understand AIOps&#8217; true potential for DevOps. While CloudOps teams understand that AIOps provides a layer of automation to remove the humans from having to deal the rising multicloud complexity, organizations are now considering integration with DevOps tool chains and processes. The advantages of leveraging AIOps as part of the DevOps tool chain includes the ability to leverage automated operational feedback from AIOps tools, including root-cause analysis and data consolidation/aggregation, that allows organizations to summarize gigabytes of operational data and direct that back to developers for application improvement, as well as to the automated DevOps systems such as testing, integration, and deployment. The objective will be to provide automated improvement of application operations, without having to have humans figure out what’s wrong and how to fix it. <br /><em>—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/davidlinthicum" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">David Linthicum</a>, chief cloud strategy officer at Deloitte Consulting</em></p>
<h4><strong>Microservice configuration management will become critical for tracking and deploying logical application versions and microservices across clusters.</strong></h4>
<p>Tracking the versions of microservices running across all clusters will become increasingly difficult as organizations embrace Kubernetes. In the process, those organizations will lose the concept of application versions and instead will need to track microservice relationships and configurations cluster by cluster.</p>
<p>To address the challenge, organizations will begin automating configuration management of microservices, versions, and the logical applications they create before deploying them to clusters. Those configuration insights will provide DevOps teams with the data they need to make informed decisions and the confidence to push microservices across dozens of clusters all day long. The bottom line: You will still need the ability to control what you release to your end users. Tracking the configurations and versions of services to application relationships will eliminate the risk and complexity of a microservice implementation. <br /><em>—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/@tracyragan" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tracy Ragan</a>, CEO and co-founder, DeployHub</em></p>
<h4><strong>Organizations will strive to achieve the platform-as-a-product model for internal platforms, but adoption will be difficult.</strong></h4>
<p>Organizations seeking to limit the cognitive load on software product teams have successfully used a platform-as-a-product model for defining, refining, and running their internal platforms. By applying to internal platforms the product management approaches normally used for B2C and B2B cloud products—such as UX, user personas, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and fine-grained cost tracking—organizations will find that their internal platforms are more responsive, less bloated, and less constraining to software product teams. But treating an internal platform as a product needs a different mindset and approach compared to the inflexible, monolithic, and cumbersome internal platforms of the past. Many organizations will adopt the surface aspects of platform as a product without the deep change needed; without true product management and a focus on UX, these approaches will flounder.<br /><em>—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/matthewpskelton" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Matthew Skelton</a>, founder of Conflux and co-author of the book </em><a target="_blank" href="https://teamtopologies.com/book" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Team Topologies</a></p>
<h3><strong>Development</strong></h3>
<div dir="ltr" style="margin:0px">
<p><h4><strong>Developers will have more say in the technology direction and data strategy of their companies.</strong></h4>
</p>
</div>
<p>Expect an aggressive “shift left” across all industries, where CIO’s will depend more on their development teams to guide the technical direction of the company. Historically, development teams have taken a top-down approach to move their data to the cloud, but, as with many things in the world, that changed with the pandemic and the subsequent reinforcement of cloud-based environments. In 2021, DevOps teams will continue to have far more say in the data strategy process, and as a result we’ll see a greater increase in the mobility of workloads, correlating with an increase in cloud data management techniques.<br /><em>—<a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/dannyallan5" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Danny Allan</a>, chief technology officer, Veeam</em></p>
<h4><strong>In an all-digital world, developers will have a more important seat at the table.</strong></h4>
<p>Rapid technology advancements, sweeping changes in business priorities, and a seemingly insatiable demand for software have collided—meaning developer roles will evolve and will have a more important seat at the table. GitLab’s latest DevSecOps survey found that developers are already seeing this change and reporting new ops and security responsibilities while releasing software at a faster rate. In 2021, software will be seen as critical to business success, and developers will become embedded in business teams, rather than technology teams.<br /><em>—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/olearycrew" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Brendan O&#8217;Leary</a>, senior developer evangelist, GitLab</em></p>
<h4><strong>Organizations will finally realize that deploying to production on every code commit isn&#8217;t always appropriate.</strong></h4>
<p>Though much is made of the big tech companies’ ability to deploy to production many times per hour and deploy to production on each code commit, organizations will begin to realize that that approach isn’t always appropriate. In order to succeed with that level of code commits, an organization’s software and associated delivery must have both a low cost of change and a low cost of failure. The big tech companies have lots of resources that they can choose to expend on establishing and maintaining these low costs. Most organizations will realize, however, that they don’t fall into that “deep pockets” category, and so they must craft continuous delivery processes that are consistent with that organization’s tolerance for change and failure. More organizations will be responsible and appropriate with their expectations and plans in 2021.<br /><em>—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/pgrizzaffi" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Paul Grizzaffi</a>, principal automation architect at Magenic</em></p>
<h4><strong>DevOps will follow the path of &#8220;BADgile,&#8221; becoming DevOps for most teams.</strong></h4>
<p>Many teams are mistakenly “doing agile” rather than “being agile” and have ended up with &#8220;BADgile,&#8221; and this same affliction will also affect teams moving to DevOps in the coming year. Their over-focus on automation tools will result in missed requirements and more defects pushed into production.</p>
<p>Successful DevOps teams will improve their end-to-end processes first, including robust automated and manual testing to validate quality standards and security requirements, and the segregation of duties across workflows. Because you can&#8217;t fail fast enough to make up for poor quality.<br /><em>—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/hanseckman" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hans Eckman</a>, principal research director, applications—agile development and management, Info-Tech Research Group</em></p>
<h3>Value streams</h3>
<h4><strong>DevOps will expand from product delivery to value delivery.</strong></h4>
<p>DevOps will expand beyond product delivery to business value delivery and value stream delivery, enabling a broader digital transformation. This requires taking an outside-in view from the business outcomes back into the people, processes, and technologies required to power them. We will see tighter collaboration between business stakeholders and delivery teams, aligning goals and measuring the right business KPIs such as customer satisfaction, usage, and transaction rates, followed by continuous adaptations in processes and technologies to improve them.<br /><em>—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/yaniv-sayers/1/658/234" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Yaniv Sayers</a>,<strong> </strong>senior director and chief technologist, Micro Focus</em></p>
<h4><strong>DevOps journeys will accelerate as teams adopt value stream management practices and platforms cross-organization.</strong></h4>
<p>DevOps debuted with <a target="_blank" href="https://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the Three Ways</a>, the first of which focuses on optimizing the flow of work, but teams are still struggling with understanding and improving cycle times from idea to value realization. Increasingly, organizations will be designing around value streams, and value stream mapping has long been established as a de facto practice for laying the groundwork for making improvements based on DevOps principles. Where value stream mapping failed, in driving ongoing, continuous and data-driven conversations that measure progress in a DevOps journey, value stream management will win. It connects the elements of the DevOps toolchain, allowing visibility of value, since it starts as an idea and continuing through its journey until it reaches the customer. By inspecting their value stream management platform’s data and insights, teams will be able to adapt, choose whether to pivot or persevere based on value stream performance, and receive real-time customer feedback.<br /><em>—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/BealHelen" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Helen Beal</a>, chief ambassador, DevOps Institute</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<h2 id="h.fsfwbygp4ipr"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Traditionally, web applications built on Drupal are built using various entities like Content types, blocks, components using Layout Builder, and then the product is made available to the end-user on the front-end using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The team usually starts with back-end stories related to building various content types, related roles, and permissions, and then the front-end team picks it up to make the site more usable and accessible as per the design requirements.</p>
<p>Of course, with component libraries like Storybook, Fractal, PatternLab, and with designs in place, the front-end team can start implementing them as component libraries in parallel, which are later integrated with Drupal.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about testing the application in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="h.ol22312lyu0p"><strong>Automated Testing in Drupal</strong></h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://behat.org/en/latest/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Behat</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://phpunit.de" rel="noopener noreferrer">PHPUnit</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.com/weitzman/drupal-test-traits" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drupal Test Traits (DTT)</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://nightwatchjs.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">NightwatchJS</a> are the most widely used tools for automating tests with Drupal. There are several reasons why these tools are popular within the Drupal community, such as all these tools are PHP-based frameworks (apart from NightwatchJS), offer ready to use Drupal extensions/plugins and have huge community support.</p>
<p>With these tools, one can automate unit, integration, and acceptance level tests. But what about automating the visual tests? That’s the missing tip of the pyramid which we will address through this blog post.</p>
<p>We have used <a target="_blank" href="http://cypress.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cypress</a> to automate the browser and <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools</a> for AI-based visual validation. Our reasons for using Cypress over other tools are many, including the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>One can quickly get started with writing actual tests with Cypress as compared to Selenium.</li>
<li>Cypress enables fast-paced test execution.</li>
<li>Our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.axelerant.com/resources/team-blog/usecase-setup-e2e-testing-drupal-website-cypress" rel="noopener noreferrer">POC</a> with Cypress + Drupal proved that testing the Drupal side of things can also be achieved with Cypress.</li>
<li>Cypress offers harmonious integration with Applitools. Having said that, please note that Applitools does have SDKs for <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/selenium-php.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium PHP</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://libraries.io/npm/@applitools%2Feyes-nightwatch" rel="noopener noreferrer">NightwatchJS</a> and many <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/" rel="noopener noreferrer">more</a> just in case you have your existing automation functional suites written using any of the other testing frameworks.</li>
<li>Since Cypress is a JS-based framework, developers can also contribute to writing automated tests.</li>
</ol>
<p>The site to demonstrate the concept is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/umami-drupal-demonstration-installation-profile" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drupal Umami</a>, the major advantage being that the site is already constructed and we can directly focus on writing automated visual tests without having to worry about creating these pages.</p>
<p>NOTE: If you are completely new to the concept of automated visual validation testing, then please refer to the course <a target="_blank" href="https://testautomationu.applitools.com/automated-visual-testing-a-fast-path-to-test-automation-success/" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Automated Visual Testing: A Fast Path To Test Automation Success”</a> on Test Automation University from Angie Jones.</p>
<h2 id="h.mzma644tnsm2"><strong>Applitools and Drupal</strong></h2>
<p>Applitools provides an <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/cypress.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">SDK</a> for Cypress which makes it very easy for us to integrate automated visual validation tests in the same functional test suite created using Cypress. The steps to configure Applitools with Cypress are straightforward and you can refer to their official <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/cypress.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> for more details. Let’s take a look at the test written for the Homepage. The gist as shown below:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler"/>
<p>The test in the above example launches the homepage and verifies the UI using the “<em>checkWindow()</em>” command. The <em>checkWindow()</em> command takes in the following parameters:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>tag:</em> The name of the test.</li>
<li><em>target:</em> Shall the window be targeted or a particular element?</li>
<li><em>fully:</em> Identify the scope, whether it is the current viewport or the entire window.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it! And you are ready to execute the first automated visual test. So, let’s execute it using the command `npx cypress run`, assuming that the baseline image was captured correctly on the first run.</p>
<p>Here’s a small <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DnKrVV4bOUtt2XzVLKPEKnKjQRTQvHHo/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer">screencast</a> for the same.</p>
<h3 id="h.b8d90akgbkwh"><strong>Interpreting the automated test execution results</strong></h3>
<p>Now that the tests have been executed, let’s look at the execution results, which brings us to the Applitools <a target="_blank" href="https://help.applitools.com/hc/en-us/sections/360001585211-Test-Results-Dashboard" rel="noopener noreferrer">dashboard</a>. Here’s the <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XW5od_Tegi_fO1G-EPE_ZLKY9zS1JCjc/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer">passed</a> test result.</p>
<p>The tests passing is a good thing. However, that’s not the primary reason for having automated tests. You want the tests to correctly detect the discrepancies as close as the point of introduction. For the purpose of this demo, we have intentionally introduced a couple of CSS bugs on the homepage through Cypress’s invoke command. Once the script launches the homepage, CSS changes are made at run-time in the browser and then the screenshots are captured as below:</p>

<p>Let’s re-execute our test to see how the tool catches these bugs. The tool has correctly highlighted the three errors (in pink color) below that we introduced on purpose:</p>
<ol>
<li>“Search bar” in the header has shifted from its original position.</li>
<li>The font-color for the “View recipe” button on the banner has changed.</li>
<li>“Find out more” link in the footer.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="wp-block-table"/>
<p>We confirm that these indeed are bugs, and reject the image marking the test as failed and then report bugs in Jira directly from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://applitools.com/docs/topics/integrations/jira-integration.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1606107886944000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3VPmk75LrQx6fkwRgO_Eo-" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools</a>. Additionally, the <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/root-cause-analysis/" rel="noopener noreferrer">root cause analysis</a> feature from Applitools helps us quickly identify the visual (UI) issues, in this case, caused by CSS changes  as shown in the images below:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>RCA RGB Bug</figcaption></figure>
<p>Until now, it was only about one browser. However, if we really want to leverage the automated tests written for validating the UI, then the true benefit lies in having the ability to execute these tests across several browsers, Operating systems, and devices. Verifying that the UI looks correct on one browser/device doesn’t guarantee that it would look exactly the same on all other browsers/devices because the rendering of the UI might be different on other browsers/devices.</p>
<h3 id="h.rgtifo85xuwc"><strong>Cross-browser/device/OS testing using the Ultrafast </strong>Test Cloud</h3>
<p>Now that we have seen and understood how automated visual testing is done with one browser, let’s discuss some points that need to be accounted for to scale up your automated testing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Configure your suite to execute automated tests across several browsers and devices. However, not only the test authoring time increases but also creates a dependency on the technical staff as the logic for tests to run all tests across several browsers and devices need to be coded.</li>
<li>Linear automated test execution increases execution time, thereby resulting in larger build times and delaying the feedback of the application to the entire team.</li>
<li>Maintain an in-house grid for parallel execution or purchase additional subscriptions provided by Cloud-based solutions for parallel execution of automated tests.</li>
</ol>
<p>This brings us to discussing the Applitools Ultrafast Test Cloud which inherently takes care of the above points.</p>
<p>By using Applitools Ultrafast Test Cloud, you would be able to execute the automated visual validation tests across several browsers, operating systems, and devices of your choice and at lightning speed as although the test runs once on say Chrome (assuming Chromedriver is configured in the tests), the capturing of the pages occurs in parallel, in the background for all the configured browsers and viewports.</p>
<p>So, let’s write some more tests for Articles and Recipes landing and listing pages on the site. Let us also execute these tests in parallel on several browsers/devices as configured below using Applitools Ultrafast grid solution:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler"/>
<p>Here are the Ultrafast Grid <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WCtG97PgiAZGGOdg33aTGaAdKQmCRWSB/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer">Test Results</a> across several browsers and devices.</p>
<p>To be precise, here are the details:</p>
<ol>
<li>Number of browsers and devices = 7</li>
<li>Total number of functional tests = 6</li>
<li>Total number of visual tests = 7*6 = 42</li>
<li>The time taken for complete execution on Ultrafast grid – 5 minutes 2 seconds</li>
</ol>
<p>Execute once and see the results on so many browsers and devices. Now, that’s what I call truly automating your visual tests.</p>
<p>Also, notice that using the Applitools <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/docs/topics/working-with-test-batches/working-with-test-batches-in-overview.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Batch</a> feature, we have logically grouped the Test Results, to make it extremely readable.</p>
<h2 id="h.p4jx8frv8jdz"><strong>Other tools in the market</strong></h2>
<p>There are many other Open Source tools like <a target="_blank" href="https://garris.github.io/BackstopJS/" rel="noopener noreferrer">BackstopJS</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gizra.com/content/visual-regression-travis-shoov-ngrok/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shoov</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://yandex.com/dev/gemini/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://webdriver.io/blog/2019/05/18/visual-regression-for-v5.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual regression</a> service for WebdriverIO to name only a few, but none of the tools has the Applitools advantage and we will look at a few of many reasons in the coming section.</p>
<h3 id="h.x88ozo2n75uv"><strong>The Applitools Advantage</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>The AI-driven image comparison algorithm is incredibly accurate and avoids false positives which otherwise occurs in a pixel-to-pixel based comparison. The amount of time it would take to troubleshoot false positives, especially on full-page screenshots would be time and cost-prohibitive. Pixel-based is ok for verifying small components across a short period of time, otherwise, it breaks down.</li>
<li>Seamless integration with your existing functional automation suite through several Web, mobile, screenshot, desktop, and codeless SDKs available for testing and automation frameworks like Cypress, Selenium, WebdriverIO, Nightwatch, Appium, and also languages like PHP, Java, Javascript, C#, Python only to name a few.</li>
<li>With the help of Ultrafast Test Cloud, your entire web application can be tested for visual accuracy at a fast speed (as the tests run only once whereas the visual rendering validations happen in parallel on several browsers and devices in the background) with guaranteed reliability and security.</li>
<li>Applitools also provides out of the box integration with the Storybook component library for React, Vue and Angular.</li>

<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>Over the past 9 months, the world has grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic. With closing of borders, curfews and lockdowns, technology has become essential especially in the area of security. As we all have been spending more time at home, we are grateful for reliable energy as it provides our lights, air and heating. It is imperative during these critical times that businesses run smoothly without any interruptions from cyberthreats.</p>
<p>A leading North American oil and gas company was already bombarded daily by cyberthreats before Covid-19, but the onset of the pandemic and the transition to thousands of employees working from home only made it a bigger target. From the onset of the remote work environment (and ever since), the company has experienced a much higher volume of campaigns by sophisticated threat actors.</p>
<p>Don’t want your home life disrupted? To ensure that wouldn’t happen, a vaccine was needed to resolve this issue to prevent any interruption to its business. the company’s security team purchased McAfee’s MVISION EDR after a proof-of-concept bakeoff against two competing products. The McAfee solution’s integration capabilities, attractive pricing, and lack of dependency upon a complex and costly infrastructure placed it far ahead of its endpoint threat detection and response (EDR) competitors. The need to accelerate threat response increased the company’s sense of urgency to implement <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products/mvision-edr.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">MVISION EDR.</a></p>
<p>With help from McAfee technical support experts, the company’s security team completed its roll out of MVISION EDR across 16,000 endpoints within just two weeks. Now that MVISION EDR is deployed, the IT security manager and his team have much greater visibility into threats across all endpoints, including those belonging to employees working from home. This increase in visibility and understanding has helped them quickly identify patient zero and follow the trajectory of an attack to understand its potential impact. With MVISION EDR, they were able to determine every lateral movement that took place and analyze endpoints to determine if they were affected.</p>
<p>With McAfee MVISION EDR, the company’s security team can easily prioritize alerts, quickly grasping which ones need immediate attention and which can wait. In the future they hope to leverage the solution’s artificial intelligence-guided investigations and automate tasks to keep improving threat analysis and threat hunting, all of which will shrink the time-to-response gap even more.</p>
<p>Another benefit for the security team is the ability to use MVISION EDR for inventory tracking and can easily check registry settings to monitor system licensing as well as ensure proper configurations. When they roll out new tools in the environment, for example, they use MVISION EDR to make sure that the systems are working properly and communicating the way they should.</p>
<p>As you find yourself spending all your time at home, remember the critical role your energy company plays to provide you comfort in a not so comfortable time.  Cybersecurity is complex but to find out how we are simplifying handling potential threats to our customers read the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/case-studies/cs-oil-gas-infrastructure.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">case study</a>.

<div>
<p><em>TechBeacon</em>&#8216;s special report, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/next-generation-esm-?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next-generation ESM: The evolution of service management in the enterprise</a>,&#8221; offers the latest insights on how enterprise service management is transforming the enterprise.</p>
<p>This essential guide looks at <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/extend-it-service-management?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">how enterprise service management (ESM) has evolved </a>over the last 30 years, how IT service management (ITSM) led to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/esm-essentials?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">the emergence of ESM</a>, and where the discipline goes from here. It also provides best practices for creating your own converged service management (CSM) infrastructure. Here are five important takeaways.</p>
<h3>1. ESM evolved from ITSM</h3>
<p>The first help desks were purely reactive services. If something broke, the affected employee filed a support request ticket, and eventually a technician was dispatched to fix the problem based on its severity—or, more commonly, based on the overall workload of an often-overworked tech support staff.</p>
<p>With the formalization in the late 1980s of the <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-itil4-sre-align-devops" rel="noopener noreferrer">Information Technology Infrastructure Library</a> (ITIL)—a set of practices to align IT services with business needs—the concept of <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/it-service-management-tb/automation-ai-itil-itsm" rel="noopener noreferrer">IT service management</a> was born.</p>
<p>ITSM transformed the help desk into a service that provides real, forward-looking value to its customers—the organization&#8217;s internal users. Each of the practices in the ITIL framework can be <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/8-it-service-management-metrics-matter-most" rel="noopener noreferrer">quantified with appropriate metrics</a> to measure the performance of the IT organization in real time and over the long run. Today, ITSM is the de facto standard, streamlining support and service operations to make end users and IT itself more efficient and effective.</p>
<p>ESM essentially takes the concept of ITSM and applies it company-wide. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-hamilton-a5455a34/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Paul Hamilton</a>, managing director of HaloITSM, an ITSM software developer, summarized ESM in the report as &#8220;a complete, end-to-end process in one all-encompassing system with slick communications between departments, an easy procurement process, and the perfect end-result on time, every time.&#8221;</p>
<h3>2. ESM is about more than IT</h3>
<p>From the ESM point of view, a service is a service, and it doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be tied to IT. Whether the service needed is a fix for a broken keyboard, a request for a standing desk, or the onboarding of a new employee, the task can be managed through a centralized portal that offers triage, workflow management, and intelligent automation.</p>
<p>This broader view of services delivers several benefits across the enterprise, including improved cost controls, increased overall efficiency, better accuracy, a simplified data structure, and, crucially, happier employees.</p>
<h3>3. ESM is more about &#8216;single view&#8217; than &#8216;single tool&#8217;</h3>
<p>An effective ESM environment revolves around one core tenet, said <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marilynnelson/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Marilyn Nelson</a>, global head of delivery Success for DXC&#8217;s ServiceNow practice: &#8220;How do we look at multiple transactions through a single pane of glass?&#8221; </p>
<p>By building a consistent data model where all of a business&#8217;s relevant information can be shared, data becomes more holistic, aligning three parties: employees, customers, and management.</p>
<p>Facilitating this will likely require different platforms for each line of business. But Nelson said that&#8217;s okay, since the central point of ESM isn&#8217;t necessarily that a single tool must be used, but rather that all the organization&#8217;s data is migrated to a single data lake.</p>
<h3>4. ESM is an enterprise-wide digital transformation that IT can lead</h3>
<p>Given ESM&#8217;s roots in ITSM, it&#8217;s not unreasonable to believe that the IT organization is the most appropriate choice to lead an ESM implementation. And in modern, progressive organizations, IT has had success doing that.</p>
<p>But the move to ESM is a transformation that touches every corner of the enterprise, often necessitating that the organizational chart be revamped. That requires the highest levels of leadership to be involved. The big challenge is who really owns ESM, said Doug Tedder, principal of Tedder Consulting. Outside of the CEO, there is no one role in the organization that has accountability for end-to-end work flowing through the organization, so this really takes a commitment from senior leadership, he said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The technology part of ESM is easy. The processes are the hard part.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/dougtedder" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Doug Tedder</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s worth considering whether IT can lead your ESM implementation. If so, it will need the support of your CIO and rank-and-file workers to ensure its success.</p>
<h3>5. AI will drive the next evolution of service management</h3>
<p>Converged service management will be the next evolution of ESM. The idea is for CSM to further centralize business services and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/it-service-management-how-it-tools-practices-are-evolving" rel="noopener noreferrer">fulfill service requests more quickly and with less effort</a>.</p>
<p>The discipline is still in its formative phase, but key enablers have already been identified: virtual agents and robotic process automation (RPA) to handle service requests; machine learning to identify patterns in user requests; and the holy grail, a single, user-friendly portal experience for multiple services.</p>
<p>The transition to CSM will be even more daunting than was the ESM transformation. It will require new ways of undertaking fundamental business processes, complex new technologies, and the talent to develop, implement, and manage new tools.</p>
<p>But the challenge of unifying all business lines is an essential part of the process, said DXC&#8217;s Nelson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the journey that makes digital transformation come to life.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
