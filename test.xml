					<description><![CDATA[Those of us working in service management, and throughout IT, not only spend time and effort resolving incidents, but also helping]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Those of us working in service management, and throughout IT, not only spend time and effort resolving incidents, but also helping address users&#8217; underlying tech problems. Much of this is a consequence of a bigger problem: the time constraints of <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/optimize-it-service?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">modern IT support</a>. And, as is often the case, problems lead to more problems.</p>
<p>Improving problem management processes and juggling incident management require striking a balance between the two. It&#8217;s not too challenging to tackle once you make the decision to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-ku-transformed-its-health-system-lean-it-service-management" rel="noopener noreferrer">start fixing the problems facing the service desk</a> head on.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re already working to capacity with daily responsibilities. Setting up and maintaining problem management can, therefore, quickly become a mundane job rather than a top-level priority. However, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/has-devops-morphed-itsm" rel="noopener noreferrer">taking an agile attitude</a> and being open to working both reactively and proactively can streamline the process. Here&#8217;s how.</p>
<p><em>[ Learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/enterprise-service-management-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to optimize your Enterprise Service Management (ESM)</a>. Plus: Get TechBeacon&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/buyers-guide-esm-products?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buyers Guide to ESM Products</a> ]</em></p>
<h3>1. Separate incidents from problems</h3>
<p>While it might seem counterproductive, the most crucial step is to separate single incidents from larger problems. Log these in their own dedicated spaces.</p>
<p>Doing so allows for clarity and transparency of the problem&#8217;s details, creates an accessible record during any investigations, and provides insight into the resources needed to fix all incidents. Additionally, this eliminates the temptation of storing everything in a single hold-all space that is typically used as a one-stop shop when dealing with a call.</p>
<h3>2. Create a known-error database</h3>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve identified each problem&#8217;s root cause, track these in a known-error database. Much as with incidents, keep known errors in a separate area from problems. The reason behind this is simply to allow the service desk to become more dynamic in its categorizations.</p>
<p>In the event that you must re-categorize an error to something more suitable post-investigation, you can. Now, as you discover problems, the <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/it-service-management-tb/itsm-tools-practices?lx=-rqtPA&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">service management solution </a>can provide an up-to-date record of shifts in your thinking and priorities. The known-error database then becomes an accessible, comprehensive archive of all problems discovered, as well as their workarounds for your team&#8217;s future use.</p>

<h3>3. Understand the 5 whys</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/optimize-it-service?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">Challenging the service desk&#8217;s methodology</a> helps continuously provide your team with a different perspective on daily challenges and helps identify new root causes of problems. By eliminating some of the more intensive methods for identifying problems at their core, you&#8217;re able to simplify your conflict digging.</p>
<p>An effortless way of doing so is through the &#8220;five whys&#8221; approach.</p>
<p>When adopting the five whys, you throw out complexity and return to a toddler-like approach to problem solving, asking, &#8220;Why?&#8221; &#8220;Why?&#8221; &#8220;Why?&#8221; Rather than deriving a foundational conclusion, you’re encouraged to ask even more about why something may be the way it is, asking a series of questions until arriving at the root cause. Continuing to ask why something is happening is key; typically, five whys is the magic number.</p>
<h3>4. Assign a problem manager role</h3>
<p>Assigning a member of the team or hiring someone for the position who is responsible for problem management helps improve the service desk&#8217;s entire process set. Naming an individual to help support solving problems can motivate the team in the direction of the same goal.</p>
<p>These same individuals gain—through the course of their work—the insight needed to monitor and analyze trends to better address problem management. The problem manager helps maintain momentum for the team and supports your ability to create a better internal organization for problem solving, which helps users.</p>
<h3>5. Share knowledge</h3>
<p>When it comes to problem solving, perhaps nothing is better than team collaboration. Invite the team to contribute to problem management; this adds variety to their daily roles and helps identify root causes more quickly if you have colleagues who are motivated.</p>
<p>Using the team&#8217;s knowledge also <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/customer-experience-what-counts-today-how-good-itsm-helps" rel="noopener noreferrer">helps embed cultural change</a> throughout your organization, which ultimately means better problem management for users&#8217; reported issues. </p>
<h3>A balancing act</h3>
<p>Improving problem management while also juggling incident management means striking a balance between the two. Setting up and maintaining problem management can quickly be addressed when you implement the processes for doing so simply and straightforwardly.</p>
<p>The results of doing so are well worth the effort, and your organization will reap the rewards of reduced incident impact, increased staff efficiency, and, ultimately, happier customers.</p>

<p>On the Test Maintenance Road to Nowhere? Your Visual AI Exit Is Just Ahead.</p>



<p>Congrats! You just spent hours authoring new tests. They all passed 100% of the time. Now you can now start the real work of managing quality. That is, until the application under test starts to change. Now, the potential for instability in code-based assertions surfaces, and your maintenance nightmare ensues.</p>



					</div>
					
<!-- /wp:more -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When a test fails, quality engineers spend a ton of time trying to understand the cause of the failure. Did we surface an actual regression? An unexpected new feature? An environmental issue such as a new browser or system update? A false-positive due to subtle movements in our locators? After hours of troubleshooting and frustration, we finally get the tests to pass again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just in time for the next candidate to come along. More tests break. We do it all over again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>If you have been following this blog series about the seminal report on the <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/impact-of-visual-ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of Visual AI Test Automation</a>, what follows next is logical — a test suite that relies on code-based locators requires you apply resources and team discipline to ensure locator consistency. Otherwise, assume your assertions likely will change between releases – making your test code unstable. <em>Test instability is the root cause of your test maintenance woes</em>. An example using this simple one-page application illustrates the point:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":18236} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Here is a simple login page. Our job – write the code to navigate to this page and click the Login button (our test condition) and validate the response. Since we didn’t enter a username and password combination, we expect an error response requesting that we fill both fields.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, let’s go ahead and author our functional tests using Selenium.</p>

<p>There has never been a better time to get started with enterprise service management (ESM). The vendor landscape has solidified, and TechBeacon&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/buyers-guide-esm-products?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buyer’s Guide to Enterprise Service Management Products</a> reveals a market that&#8217;s competing vigorously for your business.</p>
<p>Charles Betz, who wrote <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/forrester-wave-esm-q419?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Forrester Wave for Enterprise Service Management</a>, said the products interoperate nicely and are easier to use than those of earlier generations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Any of these tools is a credible alternative—even the ones that come in last in the &#8216;Wave.&#8217; There are around 400 tools to choose from—it&#8217;s crazy—and they all offer value of some kind.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/CharlesTBetz" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Charles Betz</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Couple that abundance of choice with enhancements that add AI, automation, machine learning, and predictive capabilities, and you have a new ESM game where businesses can save money while supporting their customers and employees with new levels of responsiveness and efficiency.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/it-service-management-tb/automation-ai-and-analytics-reinventing-itsm?lx=-rqtPA" rel="noopener noreferrer">A 2019 EMA study</a><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/it-service-management-tb/automation-ai-and-analytics-reinventing-itsm?lx=-rqtPA&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer"> </a>found that 87% of the organizations surveyed already had some level of ESM underway. So, many of your competitors are likely already reaping some of the benefits of ESM: increased customer satisfaction, scalable efficiency, and enhanced productivity. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been waiting for the right time to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/5-ways-overcome-practical-political-challenges-esm" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduce ESM to your organization</a>, there&#8217;s no longer any reason to stall. As they say, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is today.</p>
<p>Having a lot of tools to choose from can be overwhelming, but don&#8217;t worry about that quite yet. You don&#8217;t start by looking for the right tools; you start by looking for the right project. First you need to be sure you know exactly what you need to accomplish, and why that&#8217;s worth doing.</p>
<p>Many organizations have experience with <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/it-service-management-tb/itsm-tools-practices?lx=-rqtPA&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">IT service management (ITSM)</a>, but that&#8217;s not quite the same thing. </p>
<p>A key difference between ESM and ITSM is scope. ITSM refers to services delivered by IT—things such as provisioning laptops, managing cloud services, and patching and upgrading servers. ESM is a much larger idea, covering all kinds of non-IT services your enterprise delivers to customers and employees, such as hiring, catering, business travel, and sales call requests.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/extend-it-service-management?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESM is a long-term strategy</a> for an organization and can add significant value to the business across many dimensions, over many years. But it will die after the first try in your organization if the first project is overly complex, takes too long, or delivers a mediocre result in an area that nobody really cares about.</p>
<p>Here are eight ways to set yourself up for success with a smart ESM project that will prove the value of service management and lay the foundation for your ESM road map—and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-pandemic?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">your digital transformation</a>—for years to come.</p>

<h3>1. Choose a progressive department</h3>
<p>The IT department is used to service management automation, but other departments might find it harder to embrace it. You&#8217;ll be miles ahead if you can run your project in an area of the organization that welcomes experimentation.</p>
<p>Look for a department that is known for being progressive, with managers who are not afraid of the uncertainties that come with trying new technologies and practices.</p>
<p>Avoid spinning up your initial project in a department where teams are afraid to make mistakes. They will be slower to learn and will not have the proper support and confidence to move ESM forward, said Doug Tedder, principal of Tedder Consulting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Successful companies understand that progress often requires you to fail fast and learn fast. [Their attitude is], if we don’t succeed at first, what did we learn? Let’s make changes and try again.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/dougtedder" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Doug Tedder</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is practical value in letting one area of the business step up to be the pioneers for ESM projects. Their experience will pave the way for projects across the whole organization.</p>
<p>In a couple of years, that group will be prepared to tackle more difficult ESM challenges, such as how to make sure you handle privacy data properly, he said. Without that well-supported learning model, the organization as a whole may take much longer to reach the level of ESM maturity that will let it take advantage of emerging technologies and competitive opportunities.</p>
<h3>2. Look at different request-fulfillment workflows</h3>
<p>Straightforward service requests of every kind are &#8220;low-hanging-fruit targets for starting ESM,&#8221; Tedder said. Human resources is a natural place to expand these principles beyond IT, because HR is usually &#8220;fairly well-defined regarding function and responsibilities and handles many requests from both within and external to the organization,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Phyllis Drucker, a senior consultant at Linium, said HR tended to be forward-thinking about automation, considering chatbots, for example, for their portals &#8220;even out of the gate.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;[HR organizations are] far more focused on the employee experience than many IT groups, who are more focused on the technical aspects of support.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/msitsm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Phyllis Drucker</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A fairly typical HR implementation will include setting up a portal to handle some of the more frequent HR requests. This involves importing existing knowledge into the tool&#8217;s knowledge base, and then instrumenting a common chatbot script that looks for answers or submits simple requests, according to Drucker.</p>
<p>Other corporate areas to consider are facilities, internal catering services, or really any internal support organization that receives and processes requests from another area of an organization, Tedder said.</p>
<p>When you find situations where end users, employees, or customers are currently using email or phone calls to request information or services, &#8220;they are falling-off-the-tree ripe for ESM,&#8221; according to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/enterprise-service-m?lx=XrrwBl" rel="noopener noreferrer">a 2019 EMA report</a> titled &#8220;Enterprise Service Management: It&#8217;s Closer Than You Think.&#8221; It&#8217;s based on in-depth research with 400 global IT executives.</p>
<p>Even if you use ESM only to log and track a request, close the ticket when the work is done, and deliver regular reports, you will have delivered a winning ESM project with measurable value. You&#8217;ll be replacing manual workflows where requests can get lost, forgotten, or misdirected with order, accountability, speed, and increased customer satisfaction.</p>

<h3><span>3. Choose projects with limited risks</span></h3>
<p>Make sure you start with smaller, internal processes before you jump into a workflow that customers see, Tedder said. Internal processes let you learn by doing, see results, and make adjustments, he said.</p>
<p>Customer-facing processes are less forgiving and can even damage your brand if something clumsy happens.</p>
<p>And remember that it’s very risky to work with regulated data and systems during your initial projects. Sales and financial departments are not the best places to experiment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Eventually they will benefit from what you learn on the other things.&#8221;<br />—Doug Tedder</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Always bear in mind that <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-extend-it-service-management-whole-business" rel="noopener noreferrer">your entire organization will be learning to trust service management</a>, and each successful project will build experience and credibility across the business. Limiting the exposure to risk, especially early on, will make everyone more comfortable.</p>
<h3>4. Get to launch quickly</h3>
<p>Limit the scope so you don&#8217;t run out of oxygen before you can launch. Don&#8217;t choose initial projects that will take six months or a year to complete, said Tedder. Think in terms of small, quick iterations of work.</p>
<p>Look at things that you can spin up in a month or two, and that will begin delivering measurable improvements within a quarter or two.</p>
<p>If your sponsor wants to tackle something big, break it up into phases, and make sure the first phase is meaningful and can be finished quickly.</p>
<h3>5. Use existing tools when you can</h3>
<p>People sometimes discover products already in use somewhere in the organization that could be used for ESM. Of course, not all tools can be leveraged for this purpose.</p>
<p>For example, it is very likely that someone is using some kind of ticket-tracking tool somewhere in your organization, but it might not turn out to be an ESM tool, said Tedder. You may even discover that some of those using a ticket-tracking tool are trying to use it to manage their ESM demands and are struggling, he said.</p>
<p>This kind of tool would not be a good fit for your ESM project.</p>
<p>As you look for tool capabilities that would support ESM, Tedder suggested you look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workflow definition and automation</li>
<li>Queue management</li>
<li>Performance reporting</li>
<li>Service request catalog support</li>
<li>Service portfolio support</li>
<li>Escalation/alerting</li>
<li>Ability to pre-define models (for managing requests, incidents, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-choose-it-service-management-tool" rel="noopener noreferrer">find existing ITSM tools</a> that you want to use for ESM, Tedder suggested you be very smart about how you use them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In my experience, many organizations are too concerned with the implementation of the tool and do not put any effort into the design of processes, measurement, and continual improvement—things that are critical for ESM success.&#8221;<br />—Doug Tedder</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Existing tools may not be free, so you may need to buy additional licenses when you expand the use of an existing tool. But if you can find a way to repurpose something already being used, you will benefit from having people in-house who already know how to use it, and you might be able to shave some days off of your timeline.</p>
<h3>6. Do something that will have a measurable impact</h3>
<p>ESM is supposed to make back-office operations better, faster, and cheaper across the organization, so select a project with the metrics to prove it. Choose something that can deliver business benefits, including reduced costs or improved speed and efficiency by implementing workflow automation, user self-service, or workload reductions.</p>
<p>This is likely to be where most of the financial savings will be identified that will clearly demonstrate the ROI, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/digital-transformation-esm?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent ESM white paper</a>, &#8220;Digital Transformation &amp; ESM.&#8221;</p>
<p>Be sure to capture all the relevant &#8220;before&#8221; metrics to show what the baseline was when using overly manual processes, delivering siloed responses to requests, and relying on shared email boxes to capture service requests.</p>
<p>Relevant metrics will demonstrate how ESM has made something better, faster, and/or cheaper. Track things such as average response time for incoming requests, employee satisfaction ratings, average completion time for service requests, average daily requests handled per staff member, service volumes, and even customer feedback and satisfaction scores.</p>
<p>Remember, ESM must earn the trust of the business. Data is the language you use for that.</p>
<h3>7. Leverage existing knowledge bases</h3>
<p>Having a good base of current, well-documented knowledge can set you up nicely for a chatbot implementation. With a good existing knowledge base, little else is needed to get started, said Linium&#8217;s Drucker.</p>
<p>You need a service portal with an embedded chatbot and a couple of simple scripts that allow the bot to pull information from the existing knowledge base, or submit the right request for someone, she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen organizations start at this level with a simple but robust script that searches for answers or submits a ticket,&#8221; said Drucker.</p>
<p>If you have been doing ESM for a long time and have already developed good knowledge bases, the predictive tools that some ESM apps offer are the easiest place to start adding automation, Drucker said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In some cases, you can just turn these tools on and they will almost instantly start offering up information. The effort goes into setting up the processes to deal with that information.&#8221;<br />—Phyllis Drucker</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Be prepared for what it takes</h4>
<p>Don&#8217;t underestimate the level of effort this might require. You&#8217;ll need to define exactly what should happen in every possible scenario, so your processes play by the rules of governance.</p>
<p>These examples from Drucker highlight the level of analysis that this requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a tool displays five similar incidents and five possible fixes, does the service desk agent know how to proceed? Have results been tested enough to know how exact a match is needed to avoid doing more harm versus restoring service with a workaround?</li>
<li>If the tool says a particular change has a 75% chance of success as documented, does the organization understand the process and risk well enough to drive the right level of authorization for the change, based on that prediction?</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. Take a building-block approach</h3>
<p>It’s a good idea to think about your ESM initiatives in terms of building blocks, Tedder said. Here are some tips.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the first business problem</strong> you want to solve; maybe you can do something small in that space first. It should take weeks, not years, to solve it to some degree of completeness. Get that block in place.</li>
<li><strong>Be responsive to the needs of the business.</strong> Design an adaptive, flexible road map that can adjust to emerging opportunities. You want to make sure that you are working on things that really matter to the entire organization, not just the requirements of one or two departments.</li>
<li><strong>Add block after block of new ESM projects</strong> or extended AI capabilities in a regular cadence.</li>
<li><strong>Show incremental value,</strong> using meaningful metrics mapped to business objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Continue to roll in that way, </strong>and in two years you will have everything in place that you dreamed of, and your organization will be prepared to adopt advanced technologies as they come to market.</li>
</ul>
<p>You&#8217;ll also have a lot more satisfied customers and employees by then. And you&#8217;ll probably have a bigger ESM budget and staff as well.</p>
<ol/>
<h3>Get started</h3>
<p>Once you have defined a project that you can pilot in a safe place, that won&#8217;t take too long to complete, and that will be meaningful to your business, you&#8217;re ready to think about tools. If you didn&#8217;t discover some tools already in place that are right for your project, you will need to add ESM to your toolkit.</p>
<p>Get this first project right, and you will earn the trust of the business, build expertise in your team, and establish a foundation that can support the digital transformation of your business for years to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p>
<div>
<p>The widespread use of Kubernetes is testament to enterprises&#8217; faith in their ability not just to handle the complexity of modern app development and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/sap-modernization-enterprise-devops-tb/modernize-legacy-apps?lx=AL8Ybs&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">modernization initiatives</a>, but to do so at scale.</p>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CNCF_Survey_Report.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a recent survey of 1,340 technical experts</a> in companies of all sizes, conducted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), 78% of respondents are <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/one-year-using-kubernetes-production-lessons-learned" rel="noopener noreferrer">using the open-source container orchestration tool in production</a>. This is up from just 58% last year.</p>
<p>But while Kubernetes is one of the most popular projects on GitHub, many organizations are still <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/47-advanced-tutorials-mastering-kubernetes" rel="noopener noreferrer">intimidated by its complexity</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Organizations have seen <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb/move-app-to-continuous-delivery?lx=-DC2cJ&amp;custom_url=continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">the value of building </a><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb/move-app-to-continuous-delivery?lx=-DC2cJ&amp;custom_url=continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">microservices</a>—delivering applications as discrete functional parts, each of which can be delivered as a container and managed separately. But for every application there are more parts to manage, especially at scale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kubernetes solves that problem by providing an extensible, declarative platform that <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/capistrano-kubernetes-lessons-phraseapps-transition" rel="noopener noreferrer">automates the management of containers</a> for high availability, resiliency, and scale. But Kubernetes is a big, complex, fast-moving, and sometimes confusing platform that requires users to develop new skills. The Kubernetes project itself recently completed a security audit. (Here&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/kubernetes-security-audits-what-admins-need-know-do" rel="noopener noreferrer">what admins need to know</a> about it.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Companies developing their <a target="_blank" href="http://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/kubernetes-heralds-cloud-native-era" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud-native strategies</a>, including <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/ai-ops-transform-it-tb/ai-cloud-ops-efficiency?lx=my3YKV&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">what platforms and tools they should use</a> to ensure the safe deployment of cloud-native apps, may benefit from understanding Kubernetes&#8217; security challenges, which fall into four main buckets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are the challenges you&#8217;ll face, and recommendations for mitigating them.</p>
<p><em>[ Get up to speed on <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/it-operations-monitoring-tb?utm_campaign=00134846&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_source=techbeacon" rel="noopener noreferrer">IT Operations Monitoring with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide</a>.

<h3>1. Hardening and compliance</h3>
<p dir="ltr">When using Kubernetes, you must be hyperfocused on what is and is not turned on by default. For example, pod security policies are key to securing a multi-tenant cluster, but the feature is still beta and is not turned on by default. The feature-rich Kubernetes platform can make it <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-configure-harden-your-managed-kubernetes-services" rel="noopener noreferrer">challenging to understand the default features</a>, but it is essential to figure it out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Organizations can <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/4-lessons-soc-metrics-what-your-secops-team-needs-know" rel="noopener noreferrer">use security benchmarks</a> to help harden Kubernetes. The Center for Internet Security, for example, provides configuration guidelines to harden systems, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">including Kubernetes</a>, against evolving cyber threats.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Having this type of step-by-step checklist can go a long way toward securing a system as complex as Kubernetes. However, since security is always about risk management, organizations need to evaluate <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/3-best-practices-container-performance-testing" rel="noopener noreferrer">the impact of certain settings on performance</a> and weigh the risks versus the benefits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some organizations don&#8217;t have the skillsets or time <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/6-best-practices-highly-available-kubernetes-clusters" rel="noopener noreferrer">to harden Kubernetes</a> on their own. It can be a huge job to ensure that the desired configuration of the cluster is set and maintained to include things such as ensuring access to the API server is always over HTTPS, that X.509 certificates are used to authenticate communication between platform components, or that the etcd datastore is encrypted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Organizations that are overwhelmed by even this relatively short list might want to consider a commercial implementation of Kubernetes that has already done the hardening.</p>
<h3>2. Managing configurations of all workloads deployed on the cluster</h3>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to managing the configuration of the cluster, organizations need to manage the configurations of all the workloads running on the cluster. You can use the <a target="_blank" href="https://helm.sh" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">open-source tool Helm Charts</a> to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-manage-containers-scale-3-challenges" rel="noopener noreferrer">automate application provisioning and configuration</a> for Kubernetes as well as to deploy simple or complex applications made up of several separate services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, while Helm is very useful for managing Day 1 operations, it does not extend to Day 2 operations, which is where Kubernetes operators shine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Operators are a way to package, deploy, and manage complex applications designed to run on Kubernetes. Operators take human operational knowledge and encode it into software that is packaged with the application and shared.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They make it easier for application developers to deliver automated lifecycle management for the services that run on Kubernetes. Helm Charts can also be wrapped in a Kubernetes operator and used together.</p>
<p>When it comes to security, operators ensure that services deployed on Kubernetes maintain supported configurations; if an unsupported configuration is made to a deployed service, operators can reset the service to its original, declared configuration.</p>
<p>The really interesting thing is that you can use Kubernetes operators to manage Kubernetes itself, making it easier to deliver and automate secured deployments.</p>
<p><em>[ Robotic Process Automation can do mundane tasks, allowing you to get strategic. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/8743/396776?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Find out how in this April 28 Webinar.</a></em> <em>Plus</em><em>: Learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/robotic-process-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to roll out RPA</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide. ]</em></p>
<h3>3. Managing multi-tenant clusters</h3>
<p>As Kubernetes scales, it becomes more and more difficult to manage all workloads deployed on the clusters and the clusters themselves. Multi-tenancy is one of the most effective ways to handle what could easily become chaotic. Indeed, Kubernetes&#8217; support for multi-tenancy has come a long way.</p>
<p>Key capabilities include the following, (which, you should note, are not always turned on by default):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Namespaces,</strong> which allow organizations to isolate multiple teams within the same physical cluster when used with RBAC (defined below) and network policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Role-based access control (RBAC) </strong>determines whether a user is allowed to perform a given action within a cluster or namespace. To help simplify the use of RBAC, consider the use of default roles that can be bound to users and groups cluster-wide or locally per namespace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Resource quotas in Kubernetes </strong>limit aggregate resource consumption per namespace, making systems less vulnerable to attacks such as denial of service. By default, all resources in a Kubernetes cluster are created with unbounded CPU and memory requests/limits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Network policy for micro-segmentation</strong> specifies how groups of pods communicate with each other and other network endpoints. Policies are namespace-scoped. By default, if no policies are set in a namespace, ingress and egress traffic is allowed to and from pods in that namespace.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Balancing security and agility</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The pressure is on for organizations to constantly innovate, which makes it easy to treat security as an afterthought. Ideally, security is built into the DevOps cycle, but organizations will benefit by explicitly adding &#8220;sec&#8221; into the middle of DevOps—or, put another way, by <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/6-devsecops-best-practices-automate-early-often" rel="noopener noreferrer">building as much security automation</a> into the pipeline as possible.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To ensure that app dev organizations can implement security best practices, take a step back and revisit your CI/CD pipelines. Are they using automated unit and functional tests? Have they integrated automated security gates such as integrated vulnerability scanners?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ops can help with DevSecOps by adding features to both development and production clusters that make it easy for the app dev team to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-microservices-broke-monitoring-how-fix-it" rel="noopener noreferrer">leverage monitoring, alerting, and logging services</a> in a uniform way while developing and deploying microservice-based apps.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition, while adding a service mesh to a Kubernetes cluster may seem to add complexity, it&#8217;s actually making important business logic more visible. Previously, developers needed to build the logic into their code. Now, these capabilities can be made available as part of the Kubernetes platform, saving developers work and accelerating the delivery of microservices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A service mesh also provides more visibility for microservice interactions to the operations team, especially when observability and visualization of east-west cluster traffic are included as part of the service mesh solution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But this is not just about tools; it&#8217;s also about culture and process. Ideally, this kind of self-assessment work, along with changes to the CI/CD pipeline, is done in collaboration with the organization&#8217;s security team, creating an opportunity for <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-bridge-security-development-divide" rel="noopener noreferrer">developers to learn more about security and vice versa</a>. After all, there&#8217;s a shortage of security professionals, so let&#8217;s work together and spread the wealth.</p>
<h3>Use the tools and techniques at your disposal</h3>
<p>Build security capabilities into your software that make it as easy as possible for your organization to meet its security goals without having to rely on a large collection of point products that may or may not work well together.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s terrific to see the Kubernetes community invest not only in traditional security evaluations, such as the Kubernetes security audit, but also in the full spectrum of capabilities that enhance security, including hardening guidance, RBAC, pod security policies, network policies, service mesh, and operators.</p>

<h3>Parasoft Selenic and Applitools Eyes Integrate to Improve Web UI Testing</h3>
<p>Guest Author: Joyce (Joy) Ruff, Product Marketing Manager at Parasoft.</p>
<p>In a web application design, the user interface (UI) can make or break the usability. To verify the UI works well, you need to ensure that you can thoroughly test it. As applications become more complex and more difficult to test, an automated test environment provides better visibility to potential web UI issues. </p>
<p>For many companies, Selenium is the de facto standard for web UI testing. Parasoft introduced the Selenic tool to enhance Selenium test creation with the page object model, simplify maintenance with self-healing, and reduce testing time with optimized execution. With Parasoft Selenic, you can understand if your Selenium tests have broken due to locators or wait conditions and receive AI-powered recommendations for how to fix them.</p>
<p>With the latest release, Selenic now provides integration with Applitools, which uses AI to capture screenshots of UI differences that can be hard to see without the aid of computer vision. The combination of these capabilities makes it easier for you to assess the results of your Web UI testing. With a simple configuration setup, when you run your Selenium tests with Selenic, an Applitools Visual AI screenshot will be automatically captured at each click and navigation step, ensuring maximum test coverage with incredible speed, accuracy, and stability.</p>
<p>See how fast and easy it is to integrate Applitools and Selenic for better visibility of your web UI changes in this short video.</p>
