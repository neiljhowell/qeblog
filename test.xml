<div>
<p>In this article, let us look at an example Page Object Model (POM) for a Test Automation Framework. POM is a popular <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/06/29/design-patterns-in-test-automation/" rel="noopener">design pattern</a> with classes that represent each page of an application. In some cases, it represents a repeating element such as a menu, header, footer, or widget. By the end of this article, you will read about TestProject’s <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#HowToInstallSeleniumDrivers" rel="noopener">agent</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#HowToCreateToken" rel="noopener">development token</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The agent installs Selenium drivers.</li>
<li>The development token is used by the open-source OpenSDK for communication between the agent and TestProject’s platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the agent and development token, we are going to <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#ModelYourFirstPage" rel="noopener">model our first POM</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#HowToBuildCSS" rel="noopener">build a CSS Strategy using Chrome Developer Tools</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#CreateTestClass" rel="noopener">create a Test Class</a>, then <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#ViewExampleReport" rel="noopener">view an example report</a> in TestProject. The code will be placed on GitHub at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RexJonesII/TestProject-POM-CI_CD.git" rel="noopener">https://github.com/RexJonesII/TestProject-POM-CI_CD.git</a></p>

<h2><a target="_blank" id="HowToInstallSeleniumDrivers" rel="noopener"><strong>How To Install Selenium Drivers via TestProject’s Agent</strong></h2>
<p>The agent from TestProject is a free wrapper that comes with Selenium and Appium dependencies. As a result, we have benefits for testing web and mobile applications. We can install the agent on our local machine, virtual machine, or Docker container. The operating systems include Windows, Mac, and Linux. While installing our agent, the drivers are automatically consolidated for each browser.</p>
<p>Here are the steps for installing TestProject’s agent:</p>
<ol>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://app.testproject.io/" rel="noopener">Log into TestProject</a> (or <a target="_blank" href="https://app.testproject.io/signup/" rel="noopener">sign up</a> to create a new account if you don’t have one yet. Don’t worry, it’s 100% free)</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Agents</strong> menu</li>
<li>Select the <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/6TWgSBPP2YU" rel="noopener"><strong>Download Agent</strong></a> button
<ul>
<li>Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux</li>
<li>Available for Docker</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16834 size-full" title="TestProject Agent Download" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.2-Download-Agent.png" alt="TestProject Agent Download" width="887" height="643" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.2-Download-Agent.png 887w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.2-Download-Agent-512x371.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.2-Download-Agent-768x557.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 887px) 100vw, 887px"/></p>
<p>We can also hover over the <strong>Agents</strong> menu and select <strong>Download An Agent</strong>. After installing the agent, we must make sure it is running to register the agent. We register by hovering over the Agents menu then selecting Register An Agent. In the background, our agent provides a way to control our devices while maintaining a way to share our Test Scripts.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16835" title="Select OS for TestProject Agent Download" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.3-Agent-Ment.png" alt="Select OS for TestProject Agent Download" width="590" height="597"/></p>
<h2><a target="_blank" id="HowToCreateToken" rel="noopener"><strong>How To Create Development Token</strong></h2>
<p>The purpose of a development token is to help <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/opensdk-v2" rel="noopener">TestProject’s OpenSDK</a> communicate with the agent and platform. We configure the token by defining it as an environment variable or adding it as a parameter in the driver’s constructor.</p>
<ul>
<li>The environment variable is <strong>TP_DEV_TOKEN</strong>.</li>
<li>Example constructor syntax is <strong>ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver (“token”);</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the steps for creating a developer token:</p>
<ol>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://app.testproject.io/" rel="noopener">Log into TestProject</a></li>
<li>Click the <strong>Integrations</strong> menu</li>
<li>Click <strong>Display token</strong> to receive your token</li>
</ol>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16836 size-full" title="Get developer token" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.4-Developer-Key.png" alt="Get developer token" width="888" height="664" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.4-Developer-Key.png 888w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.4-Developer-Key-512x383.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.4-Developer-Key-768x574.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px"/></p>
<p>From the screenshot, we see TestProject’s OpenSDK is available for Java, C#, and Python. It’s 1 solution for our end-to-end Test Automation Scripts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 2 allows us to select the programming language.</li>
<li>Step 3 installs the OpenSDK.</li>
<li>Step 4 provides examples and documentation for the OpenSDK.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a target="_blank" id="ModelYourFirstPage" rel="noopener"><strong>Model Your First Page Object Model (POM)</strong></h2>
<p>TestProject supports POM in our coded test and when using the <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/ai-tools/" rel="noopener">AI-Powered</a> Test Recorder. The POM is an efficient approach for managing our Test Scripts. There are 3 components in a <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2021/01/06/test-automation-framework-benefits-pom-selenium-locators-opensdk-junit/#POMBenefits" rel="noopener">POM</a> whereby the Test Scripts are stored separately from the Page Objects:</p>
<ol>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#WebPages" rel="noopener">Web Pages</a> are pages in our Application Under Test (AUT).</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#PageObjects" rel="noopener">Page Objects</a> are class files representing a web page or repeating elements on a web page.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#FormTest" rel="noopener">Test Scripts</a> are logical automation steps for testing an AUT.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a target="_blank" id="WebPages" rel="noopener"><strong>Web Pages</strong></h3>
<p>In this POM model, there will be two Web Pages from TestProject’s <a target="_blank" href="https://example.testproject.io/web/index.html" rel="noopener">Example Page</a>: Login page and Form page. The Login page contains 3 elements and the Form page contains 6 elements for our POM.</p>
<ul>
<li>Login page
<ol>
<li>Full Name field</li>
<li>Password field</li>
<li>Login button</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Form Page
<ol>
<li>Country dropdown</li>
<li>Address field</li>
<li>Email field</li>
<li>Phone field</li>
<li>Save button</li>
<li>Confirmation message</li>

<h3><a target="_blank" id="PageObjects" rel="noopener"><strong>Page Objects</strong></h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" id="BasePage" rel="noopener"><strong>BasePage</strong></h4>
<p>For a Page Object, it’s optional to include a BasePage. However, the objective of a BasePage is to operate as a superclass with common actions that will be used across other Page Objects. In our model, 2 common actions are typing text into a field and clicking a button. The following BasePage class has a method for type and click.</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java">package pages;&#13;
&#13;
import org.openqa.selenium.By;&#13;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;&#13;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;&#13;
&#13;
public class BasePage {&#13;
&#13;
  protected WebDriver driver;&#13;
&#13;
  public BasePage (WebDriver driver) {&#13;
    this.driver = driver;&#13;
  }&#13;
&#13;
  protected WebElement find (By locator) {&#13;
    return driver.findElement(locator);&#13;
  }&#13;
&#13;
  protected void type (String text, By locator) {&#13;
    find(locator).sendKeys(text);&#13;
  }&#13;
&#13;
  protected void click (By locator) {&#13;
    find(locator).click();&#13;
  }&#13;
}</pre>
<p>In addition to the common actions, our BasePage contains a constructor and find method. Here’s a breakdown of the BasePage:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>public BasePage() </strong>is the constructor designed to accept a WebDriver driver parameter. The driver will access our browser and locate elements.</li>
<li><strong>protected WebElement find ()</strong> improves readability and reduces code duplication by not writing driver.findElement() in the common method actions. For example, the type and click methods implement <u>find()</u> rather than writing <u>findElement()</u> when locating an element. The By locator parameter accepts a Selenium locator such as id, XPath, and cssSelector.</li>
<li><strong><a target="_blank" id="type" rel="noopener">protected void type ()</strong> enters data into a field using the sendKeys method. The String text parameter receives data while By locator receives a Selenium locator. find(locator) locates an element such as the text field.</li>
<li><strong><a target="_blank" id="click" rel="noopener">protected void click ()</strong> clicks a button on the Login and Form pages. When applicable, this method can also be used to click a link, radio button, or checkbox. The By locator parameter receives a Selenium locator while find(locator) locates the Login and Save buttons.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a target="_blank" id="LoginPage" rel="noopener"><strong>LoginPage</strong></h4>
<p>The LoginPage has 3 variables, 1 constructor, and 3 methods for logging into TestProject’s <a target="_blank" href="https://example.testproject.io/web/index.html" rel="noopener">Example Page</a>. Here’s the code snippet displaying LoginPage extending BasePage so LoginPage can leverage the type and click methods.</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java">package pages;&#13;
&#13;
import org.openqa.selenium.By;&#13;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;&#13;
&#13;
public class LoginPage extends BasePage {&#13;
&#13;
  private By fullNameField = By.id("name");&#13;
  private By passwordField = By.id("password");&#13;
  private By loginButton = By.id("login");&#13;
&#13;
  public LoginPage (WebDriver driver) {&#13;
    super(driver);&#13;
  }&#13;
&#13;
  public void setFullName (String fullName) {&#13;
    type(fullName, fullNameField);&#13;
  }&#13;
&#13;
  public void setPassword (String password) {&#13;
    type(password, passwordField);&#13;
  }&#13;
&#13;
  public FormPage clickLoginButton () {&#13;
    click(loginButton);&#13;
    return new FormPage(driver);&#13;
  }&#13;
}&#13;
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Variables
<ol>
<li>private By fullNameField</li>
<li>private By passwordField</li>
<li>private By loginButton</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Constructor = public LoginPage (WebDriver driver)</li>
<li>Methods
<ol>
<li>public void setFullName (String fullName)</li>
<li>public void setPassword (String password)</li>
<li>public FormPage clickLoginButton ()</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a target="_blank" id="variables" rel="noopener">variables are private so only methods in the LoginPage have access to them. By is a class for locating each element. The <a target="_blank" id="constructor" rel="noopener">constructor calls super(driver) so it can load the constructor from our BasePage. When it comes to methods, this LoginPage class has 2 types of methods:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Setter method</strong> helps create a test to interact with our application.</li>
<li><strong>Transition method</strong> helps our Test Script adapt when a page changes in the application.</li>
</ol>
<p>The setter methods are setFullName() and setPassword(). Notice how both methods take advantage of <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#type" rel="noopener">type()</a> from our BasePage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>type(fullName, fullNameField)</strong> = only write <strong>type</strong> then <strong>fullName</strong> followed by the <strong>fullNameField</strong> variable</li>
<li><strong>type(password, passwordField)</strong> = only write <strong>type</strong> then <strong>password</strong> followed by the <strong>passwordField</strong> variable</li>
</ul>
<p>The transition method is clickLoginButton(). It’s called a transition method because the application transitions from the Login Page to the Form Page after clicking the Login button. Our return type is FormPage followed by the method name clickLoginButton. The return type and return new <strong>FormPage(driver)</strong> complete the transition method. Our BasePage is called again via click then we pass in the loginButton variable.</p>
<h4><strong>FormPage</strong></h4>
<p>The FormPage has 6 variables, 1 constructor, and 3 methods. Here’s the code snippet for selecting a country, entering data, and clicking the Save button on TestProject’s <a target="_blank" href="https://example.testproject.io/web/index.html" rel="noopener">Example Page</a>.</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java">package pages;&#13;
&#13;
import org.openqa.selenium.By;&#13;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;&#13;
import org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.Select;&#13;
&#13;
public class FormPage extends BasePage {&#13;
&#13;
  private By countryDropDown = By.id("country");&#13;
  private By addressField = By.cssSelector("#address");&#13;
  private By emailAddressField = By.cssSelector("#email");&#13;
  private By phoneNumberField = By.xpath("//input[@id='phone']");&#13;
  private By saveButton = By.xpath("//button[@id='save']");&#13;
  private By confirmationMessage = By.cssSelector("#saved span");&#13;
&#13;
  public FormPage (WebDriver driver) {&#13;
    super(driver);&#13;
  }&#13;
&#13;
  public void selectFromCountryDropDown (String value) {&#13;
    Select country = new Select(find(countryDropDown));&#13;
    country.selectByVisibleText(value);&#13;
  }&#13;
&#13;
  public void completeForm (String country, String address, String email, String phone) {&#13;
    selectFromCountryDropDown(country);&#13;
    type(address, addressField);&#13;
    type(email, emailAddressField);&#13;
    type(phone, phoneNumberField);&#13;
    click(saveButton);&#13;
  }&#13;
&#13;
  public String getConfirmationMessage () {&#13;
    return find(confirmationMessage).getText();&#13;
  }&#13;
}</pre>
<p>The same concept exists for our <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#variables" rel="noopener">variables</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#constructor" rel="noopener">constructor</a> regarding both Page Objects. However, there are 2 different types of methods. It has a Convenience method and Getter method.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Convenience method</strong> combines multiple methods.</li>
<li><strong>Getter method</strong> gets the state of our application.</li>
</ol>
<p>The convenience method is <strong>completeForm()</strong> and it accepts several parameters with multiple methods. Parameters are country, address, email, and phone while the methods are selectFromCountryDropDown, type, and click. First method selectFromCountryDropDown() was created in this FormPage class but type and click leverage the <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#BasePage" rel="noopener">BasePage</a>.</p>
<p>The getter method is <strong>getConfirmationMessage()</strong> which gets a message after saving the form. It finds the confirmation message and returns the text via Selenium’s getText method. Here’s a screenshot of the confirmation message labeled “Saved”.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16839" title="Saved form" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.7-Confirmation-Message-512x430.png" alt="Saved form" width="586" height="492" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.7-Confirmation-Message-512x430.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.7-Confirmation-Message.png 621w" sizes="(max-width: 586px) 100vw, 586px"/></p>
<h2><a target="_blank" id="HowToBuildCSS" rel="noopener"><strong>How To Build CSS Strategy Using Chrome Developer Tools</strong></h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/11/26/next-generation-front-end-testing-using-webdriver-and-devtools-part-1/" rel="noopener">Chrome Developer Tools</a> is a set of tools built into Chrome and Edge. Both browsers provide ways to gain more knowledge about a web application. It has several tabs such as Elements, Console, Sources, Network, Performance, Memory, Application, Security, and Lighthouse. In the Elements tab, we can inspect an element by finding a string, selector, or XPath. Here are a screenshot and code snippet of the Login page inspecting the Full Name field.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16840 size-full" title="Element locator strategy" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.8-Inspect-Full-Name.png" alt="Element locator strategy" width="888" height="602" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.8-Inspect-Full-Name.png 888w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.8-Inspect-Full-Name-512x347.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.8-Inspect-Full-Name-768x521.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px"/></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="html">&lt;input id="name" type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter your full name" required=""&gt;</pre>
<p>It’s best to find an element when the DOM has an id attribute with a unique value. In this example, the id attribute has a value of name. As a result, we can quickly find the element using CSS Selector by writing <strong>#name</strong> in the Find by string, selector, or XPath text field.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16841" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.9-Full-Name-CSS-Selector-512x145.png" alt="Inspect using Developer Tools" width="593" height="168" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.9-Full-Name-CSS-Selector-512x145.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.9-Full-Name-CSS-Selector-768x218.png 768w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.9-Full-Name-CSS-Selector.png 887w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px"/></p>
<p>Notice how the <strong>input tag</strong> is highlighted yellow after writing <strong>#name</strong> in the text field. That means the Full Name element was successfully located in the DOM. However, in the Selenium automation code, we have the option of choosing <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2021/01/06/test-automation-framework-benefits-pom-selenium-locators-opensdk-junit/#LocatorBenefits" rel="noopener">different locators</a>.</p>
<p>Recall the <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#LoginPage" rel="noopener">LoginPage</a> class used an id locator for the fullNameField, passwordField, and loginButton variables. It’s not a requirement but many engineers start with the Selenium id locator if the <strong>id</strong> is available in the DOM.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16842" title="Elements located by ID" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.10-LoginPage-Variables-512x152.png" alt="Elements located by ID" width="596" height="177" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.10-LoginPage-Variables-512x152.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.10-LoginPage-Variables.png 581w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px"/></p>
<p>Like the Full Name field, most elements (Country, Address, Email, Phone, Save) contain an id attribute on the Form page. Therefore, we can use the Selenium id locator for each variable. However, the FormPage class uses a combination of id, cssSelector, and xpath as the <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/category/selenium/" rel="noopener">Selenium</a> locators.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2757.png" alt="❗" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Note: We probably would not use a combination of locators if our preferred locators were applicable for finding an element.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the cssSelector and XPath values. The following is a screenshot of Address located using CSS Selector and variables from our FormPage class.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16843 size-full" title="Css Selector in Developer Tools" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.11-Inspect-Address.png" alt="Css Selector in Developer Tools" width="888" height="550" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.11-Inspect-Address.png 888w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.11-Inspect-Address-512x317.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.11-Inspect-Address-768x476.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px"/></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16844" title="Using different locator strategies" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.12-FormPage-Variables-512x172.png" alt="Using different locator strategies" width="595" height="200" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.12-FormPage-Variables-512x172.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.12-FormPage-Variables.png 745w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px"/></p>
<p>The addressField and emailAddressField use cssSelector with a value starting with #.</p>
<ul>
<li>addressField = By.cssSelector(“#address”);</li>
<li>emailAddressField = By.cssSelector(“#email”)</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s different for the Phone field and Save button. They use XPath as the Selenium locator. We are going to use the Save button as an example.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16845 size-full" title="XPath example" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.13-Save-Button.png" alt="XPath example" width="887" height="347" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.13-Save-Button.png 887w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.13-Save-Button-512x200.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.13-Save-Button-768x300.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 887px) 100vw, 887px"/></p>
<p>In the AUT and Page Object class, the XPath value for the Save button is <strong>//button[@id=’save’]</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>button</strong> is the tag name</li>
<li><strong>@id</strong> identifies the attribute name</li>
<li><strong>‘save’</strong> shows the value for id is save</li>
</ul>
<p>The confirmationMessage is different from all other variables in our Page Objects. It does not have an id value and must use cssSelector or XPath. For this example, the cssSelector is shorter than XPath so our FormPage class assigns the variable to <strong>#saved span</strong>. The value for XPath is <strong>//div[@id=’saved’]/h3/span</strong>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16846 size-full" title="Css example" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.14-Confirmation-CSS-Selector.png" alt="Css example" width="883" height="454" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.14-Confirmation-CSS-Selector.png 883w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.14-Confirmation-CSS-Selector-512x263.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.14-Confirmation-CSS-Selector-768x395.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px"/></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16847 size-full" title="Css example" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.15-Confirmation-XPath.png" alt="Css example" width="889" height="449" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.15-Confirmation-XPath.png 889w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.15-Confirmation-XPath-512x259.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.15-Confirmation-XPath-768x388.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px"/></p>
<h2><a target="_blank" id="CreateTestClass" rel="noopener"><strong>Create Test Class Using POM and TestProject’s OpenSDK</strong></h2>
<p>The Test Classes consist of a class for our BaseTest and a class for executing our automation steps.</p>
<h3><strong>BaseTest</strong></h3>
<p>The purpose of our BaseTest is similar to a BasePage. It serves as a parent class that will be extended by child classes. The common methods across each Test Class are set up and tear down our test. Set up methods are annotated with @BeforeClass while tear down methods are annotated with @AfterClass. We use a Test Framework like <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/02/26/junit-5/" rel="noopener">JUnit</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/10/31/the-power-of-testng-test-next-generation/" rel="noopener">TestNG</a> for testing java classes. Here’s the code snippet for BaseTest.</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java">package tests;&#13;
&#13;
import io.github.bonigarcia.wdm.WebDriverManager;&#13;
import io.testproject.sdk.drivers.web.ChromeDriver;&#13;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeOptions;&#13;
import org.testng.annotations.AfterClass;&#13;
import org.testng.annotations.BeforeClass;&#13;
import pages.LoginPage;&#13;
&#13;
public class BaseTest {&#13;
  protected ChromeDriver driver;&#13;
  private final String URL = "https://example.testproject.io/web/index.html";&#13;
  protected LoginPage loginPage;&#13;
&#13;
  @BeforeClass&#13;
  public void setUp () throws Exception {&#13;
    WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();&#13;
&#13;
    driver = new ChromeDriver(&#13;
            "add token value from TestProject",&#13;
            new ChromeOptions(),&#13;
            "My first Project");&#13;
    driver.manage().window().maximize();&#13;
    driver.get(URL);&#13;
    loginPage = new LoginPage(driver);&#13;
  }&#13;
&#13;
  @AfterClass&#13;
  public void tearDown () throws Exception {&#13;
    driver.quit();&#13;
  }&#13;
}</pre>
<p>TestProject’s OpenSDK looks just like pure Selenium code. That’s the benefit of using <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener">TestProject</a>. There’s not a learning curve if you are already familiar with Selenium commands. The ChromeDriver import statement is <strong>import io.testproject.sdk.drivers.web.ChromeDriver</strong> which initiates a new session with the Agent using a provided token and project name.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16848 size-full" title="Initialize ChromeDriver using TestProject" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.16-ChromeDriver.png" alt="Initialize ChromeDriver using TestProject" width="810" height="552" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.16-ChromeDriver.png 810w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.16-ChromeDriver-512x349.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.16-ChromeDriver-768x523.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px"/></p>
<p>Within the setup() method, we add the <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/##HowToCreateToken" rel="noopener">token value</a> from TestProject, new ChromeOptions(), then include a project name. The application is loaded by writing driver.get(URL) and we quit the browser via teardown() method.</p>
<h3><a target="_blank" id="FormTest" rel="noopener"><strong>FormTest</strong></h3>
<p>The FormTest class contains easy to read steps for completing the form. They are easy to read because our Page Objects and BaseTest incorporate most of the work. Page Object classes utilize Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and incorporate Selenium WebDriver methods. The BaseTest makes sure our Pre-Conditions and Post-Conditions are in place. Here’s the code snippet for the FormTest class.</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="java">package tests;&#13;
&#13;
import org.testng.Assert;&#13;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;&#13;
import pages.FormPage;&#13;
&#13;
public class FormTest extends BaseTest {&#13;
&#13;
  @Test&#13;
  public void logIntoTestProjectExamplePage () {&#13;
&#13;
    loginPage.setFullName("Rex Jones II");&#13;
    loginPage.setPassword("12345");&#13;
    FormPage formPage = loginPage.clickLoginButton();&#13;
&#13;
    formPage.completeForm(&#13;
            "United States",&#13;
            "1234 TestProject",&#13;
            "<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c193a4b9ef8baeafa4b28195a4b2b5f592b4a2a2a4b2b2efaeb3a6" rel="noopener">[email protected]</a>",&#13;
            "214-225-1234");&#13;
&#13;
    Assert.assertTrue(formPage.getConfirmationMessage().equals("Saved"));&#13;
  }&#13;
}</pre>
<p>Before writing our automation steps, we begin by extending our BaseTest. Next, is the <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/10/31/the-power-of-testng-test-next-generation/#test-annotation" rel="noopener">@Test</a> annotation which identifies our <strong>logIntoTestProjectExamplePage</strong> method as a Test Method. At this point, our logic starts on the Login page.</p>
<ul>
<li>Login Page
<ul>
<li>The first step is to enter the Full Name via <strong>setFullName(“Rex Jones II”)</strong></li>
<li>The second step is to enter the Password via <strong>setPassword(“12345”)</strong></li>
<li>The final step is to click the Login button via <strong>clickLoginButton()</strong></li>
<li>Our Test Script transitions to the <strong>FormPage</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Form Page
<ul>
<li>Complete the form by selecting “<strong>United States</strong>” as the country</li>
<li>Enter the address as “<strong>1234 TestProject</strong>”</li>
<li>Enter the email as <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="83d1e6fbadc9ecede6f0c3d7e6f0f7b7d0f6e0e0e6f0f0adecf1e4" rel="noopener">[email protected]</a></strong></li>
<li>Enter the phone as “<strong>214-225-1234</strong>”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Verify the form with an <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/10/31/the-power-of-testng-test-next-generation/#assertions" rel="noopener">assertion</a>. We assertTrue the confirmation message equals Saved on the Form page.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a target="_blank" id="ViewExampleReport" rel="noopener"><strong>View Example Report In TestProject</strong></h2>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/executive-test-reports/" rel="noopener">reports</a> are generated automatically and offer visibility into our testing progress. Examples of the Velocity and Individual Run Reports are below after executing the FormTest.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16849 size-full" title="TestProject Velocity report example" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.17-Velocity-Report.png" alt="TestProject Velocity report example" width="888" height="565" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.17-Velocity-Report.png 888w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.17-Velocity-Report-512x326.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.17-Velocity-Report-768x489.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px"/></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16850 size-full" title="Test run report example" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.18-Individual-Run-Report.png" alt="Test run report example" width="888" height="470" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.18-Individual-Run-Report.png 888w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.18-Individual-Run-Report-512x271.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/16.18-Individual-Run-Report-768x406.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px"/></p>
<p>The Velocity Report shows a total of 4 executions. 1 test failed and 3 tests passed for a 75% Success Ratio. It also shows the last execution Passed status.</p>
<p>The Individual Run Report provides details for each test and each step. We see 100% Passed for the test and every step on the right side of the report. A green vertical bar indicates that a specific step passed. In addition, we can also download a Summary and/or Full Report of the test. This helps a lot for debugging and understanding the quality of our Application Under Test. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusions</strong></h2>
<p>This Page Object Model example should give you an idea of how to build your own automation testing framework using TestProject, Selenium WebDriver and TestNG.</p>
<p>Happy Testing! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h2><strong>It’s Time to Have “The Talk” About the Internet: 7 Conversation-Starters for Staying Much Safer Online</strong></h2>
<p>With Safer Internet Day upon us, it’s time to have “The Talk.” The internet talk, that is.</p>
<p>What’s the internet talk? It’s a candid conversation about how safe we’re <em>really</em> being when we go online, as opposed to how safe we <em>think </em>we’re being. Indeed, there can be a sizable gap between the two, and our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/52367395/en" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021 Consumer Security Mindset Report</a> shows us just how significant it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 out of 3 people in the U.S. (66%) say they’re concerned about today’s cyber risks—a striking statistic despite <a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273550/data-breaches-recorded-in-the-united-states-by-number-of-breaches-and-records-exposed/" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly 6,500 data breaches and 1.1 billion records exposed just between 2010 and 2019 in the U.S. alone</a></li>
<li>70% of respondents said they purchased at least one connected device in 2020, while 1 in 3 bought three connected devices. However,</li>
<li>Only 50% purchased security software, and 1 in 4 of those who have said that they check to see if their security software is up to date.</li>
<li>Over half of U.S. respondents (51%) said that they never considered how much the data they store online is worth. However, nearly 9 in 10 consumers say they would be proactive about protecting that data if it could be traded as a currency, which indeed it is by hackers who sell it on the black market.</li>
<li>Nearly 1 in 3 (29%) respondents admitted that they are not confident in their ability to prevent a cyber-attack.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t know about you, but I was struck by the fact that only 50% of people are purchasing security software when they buy a new device. If that’s so, then it’s indeed it’s time for the talk.</p>
<p>Whether we have the talk with our kids, our parents, or even have it with ourselves, this is a chance to make sure we’re protecting the things that matter when we go online—our families, our privacy, our finances, our data, and, of course, our stuff too—like our computers, tablets, smartphones, and other connected things too.</p>
<h3><strong>Internet security: What’s there to talk about?</strong></h3>
<p>Plenty. However, let’s look at Safer Internet Day as a way to take some important first steps by asking a handful of questions that can lead to a much safer you online.</p>
<h3><strong>1) Are you using holistic security solutions?</strong></h3>
<p>Given that security software statistic mentioned above, let’s start at square one. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holistic security solutions will provide you with strong antivirus protection and much more on top of that</a>. It can steer you clear of malicious downloads and links, intercept phishing emails before they hit your inbox, and protect your privacy as well—just to name a few. Additionally, it can protect your smartphones and tablets too, whether you have a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/android.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/ios.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS devices</a>. Don’t forget to cover those things too, as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/#:~:text=Mobile%20accounts%20for%20approximately%20half,since%20the%20beginning%20of%202017." rel="noopener noreferrer">chances are you do about half of your browsing on them</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>2) Are your passwords strong and unique?</strong></h3>
<p>If you’re using simple passwords or repeating the use of the same password with little or no variation, it’s time to make a change. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe/?hilite=%27password%27" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strong, unique passwords protect you</a> in this age of data breaches and hacks, where passwords are stolen and then sold on the black market. If creating strong and unique passwords for each of your accounts sounds like a lot of work, consider using a password manager to create and securely store passwords for you.</p>
<h3><strong>3) Are you protected by a firewall and a VPN?</strong></h3>
<p>A firewall acts as a digital barrier that blocks unauthorized access to your computers and devices, which is a must these days (and has been for some time now). It’s often included with comprehensive security software (one more reason why having comprehensive security software is far superior to having “just” antivirus).</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn/mcafee-safe-connect.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">A virtual private network (VPN) is software that creates a secure connection over the internet</a>, so you can safely connect from anywhere. You may want to use it at home when you’re looking for extra protection while banking or handling finances. And you’ll most certainly want to use it when logged into public Wi-Fi at places like airports, hotels, and cafes because so-called “free Wi-Fi” is often unsecured, making it easier for hackers to access your device or the information you’re sending and receiving.</p>
<h3><strong>4) Are you oversharing on social media?</strong></h3>
<p>It may come as surprising, but hackers can piece together a great deal of information about you from social media and use it as the means for all manner of attacks. That includes identity theft, social engineering attacks where they impersonate you or someone you know, and even password theft. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/50plus-tech-savvy-but-still-at-risk/?hilite=%27oversh%27" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avoid oversharing on social media</a> by keeping details like addresses, school names, and other personally identifying information to yourself. Also, set you profiles to private so that only friends and family can see them.</p>
<h3><strong>5) Can you tell a secure website from one that isn’t?</strong></h3>
<p>When you’re shopping, banking, or passing along any sort of sensitive information, make sure the site address starts with “https” instead of “http.” The “s” stands for secure, and many browsers will represent that with a little padlock icon to indicate use of https, which uses encryption to scramble and help secure data from prying eyes.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/safe-browser/mcafee-webadvisor.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another form of protection from malicious sites is McAfee Web Advisor</a>, which can help you steer you clear of adware, spyware, viruses, phishing scams, and sketchy downloads.</p>
<h3><strong>6) Are you updating your apps and software?</strong></h3>
<p>Updates do more than keep your apps and software current with the latest features, they often include security improvements as well. When and where possible, set your devices and software to update automatically. And when prompted to update, say yes. The few moments you spend here can prevent major headaches down the road should your app or software open an avenue to an attack.</p>
<h3><strong>7) When’s the last time you backed up your data?</strong></h3>
<p>Now that’s the $50,000 question. And I say that only half-jokingly. Where would you be without your photos, files, tax records, finances, projects, and so on? The answer is probably “a world of hurt.” Losing it could set you back personally and financially. Back up your data. I suggest doing so with a combination of a reputable cloud storage service and a local physical device like an external hard drive that you store in a safe location.</p>
<p>Another option for particularly sensitive data and files is use encrypted storage. For example, our File Lock feature allows you to create password-protected encrypted drives on your PC that only appear when you’ve unlocked them, perfect for storing sensitive files like tax returns and financial documents.</p>
<h3><strong>Having “The Talk” is your first step to a much safer life online</strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes asking the right question can set things in motion, and I hope that’s what this little talk does by helping you identify and patch up any gaps you find in your security. Go ahead and set aside some time to have “The Talk.” You and anyone you have it with will be safer for it.</p>
<h3><strong>Stay Updated </strong></h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<h2><strong>1. Attackers have a plan, with clear objectives and outcomes in mind. Do you have one?</strong></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Clearly this was a motivated and patient adversary. They spent many months in the planning and execution of an attack that was not incredibly sophisticated in its tactics, but rather used multiple semi-novel attack methods combined with persistent, stealthy and well-orchestrated processes. In a world where we always need to find ways to stay even one step ahead of adversaries, how well is your SOC prepared to bring the same level of consistent, methodical and well-orchestrated visibility and response when such an adversary comes knocking at your door?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Plan, test and continuously improve your SecOps processes with effective purple-teaming exercises. Try to think like a stealthy attacker and predict what sources of telemetry will be necessary to detect suspicious usage of legitimate applications and trusted software solutions.</span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Modern attacks abuse trust, not necessarily vulnerabilities. Be</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">threat focused</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">. Do threat modeling and identify where the risks are. Leverage BCP data and think of your identity providers (AD Domain Controllers, Azure AD, etc.) as ‘crown jewels’.</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Assume that your most critical assets are under attack, especially those that leverage third-party applications where elevated privileges are a requirement for their effective operation. Granting service accounts unrestricted administrative privileges sounds like a bad idea – because it is. Least-privilege access, </span><span data-contrast="auto">micro segmentation</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and ingress/egress traffic filtering should be implemented in support of a Zero-Trust program for those assets specifically that allow outside access by a ‘trusted’ 3rd-party.</span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. IOCs are becoming less useful as attackers don’t reuse them, sometimes even inside the same victim. Focus on TTPs &amp; behaviors.</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The threat research world has moved beyond atomic indicators, file hashes and watchlists of malicious IPs and domains upon which most threat intelligence providers still rely. Think beyond Indicators of Compromise. </span><span data-contrast="auto">We should rely less on</span><span data-contrast="auto"> static lists of artifacts but </span><span data-contrast="auto">instead</span><span data-contrast="auto"> focused on heuristics and behavioral indicators. Event-only analysis can easily identify the low-hanging fruit of commodity attack patterns, but more sophisticated adversaries are going to make it more difficult. Ephemeral C2 servers and single-use DNS entries per asset (not target enterprise) were some of the more well-planned (yet relatively simple) behaviors seen in the Sunburst attack. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Monitor</span><span data-contrast="auto"> carefully for changes in asset configuration like logging output/location or even the absence of new audit messages in a given polling period. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">4</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">. Beware of the perfect attack fallacy. Attackers can’t innovate across the entire attack chain. Identify places where you have more chances to detect their presence (i.e. privilege escalation, persistency, discovery, defense evasion, etc.)</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">All telemetry is NOT created equal. Behavioral analysis of authentication events in support of UEBA detections can be incredibly effective, but that assumes identity data is available in the event stream. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Based on my experience, </span><span data-contrast="auto">SIEM data typically yields only 15-20% of events that include useful identity data, whereas almost 85% of cloud access events contain this rich contextual data, a byproduct of growing IAM adoption and SSO practices. Events generated from critical assets (crown jewels) are of obvious interest to SecOps analysts for both detection and investigation, but don’t lose sight of those assets on the periphery; perhaps an RDP </span><span data-contrast="auto">jump box</span><span data-contrast="auto"> sitting in the DMZ that also synchronizes trust with enterprise AD servers either on-premises or in the cloud. Find ways to isolate assets with elevated privilege or those running ‘trusted’ third-party applications using </span><span data-contrast="auto">micro segmentation</span><span data-contrast="auto"> where behavioral analysis can more easily be performed. Leverage volumetric analysis of network traffic to identify potentially abnormal patterns; monitor inbound and outbound requests (DNS, HTTP, FTP, </span><span data-contrast="auto">etc</span><span data-contrast="auto">) to detect when a new session has been made to/from an unknown source/destination – or where the registration age of the target domain seems suspiciously new. Learn what ‘normal’ looks like from these assets by baselining and fingerprinting, so that unusual activity can be blocked or at the very least escalated to an analyst for review.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">5</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">. Architect your defenses for visibility, detection &amp; response to augment protection capabilities. Leverage EDR, XDR &amp; SIEM for historical and real-time threat hunting.</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The only way to gain insight into the attacker behaviors – and any chance of detecting and disrupting attacks of this style – require extensive telemetry from a wide array of sensors. Endpoint sensor grids provide high-fidelity telemetry about all things on-</span><span data-contrast="auto">device but</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">are rarely deployed </span><span data-contrast="auto">on server assets</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and tend to be </span><span data-contrast="auto">‘</span><span data-contrast="auto">network-blind</span><span data-contrast="auto">’</span><span data-contrast="auto">. SIEMs have traditionally been leveraged to consume and correlate data from all 3rd-party data sources, but it likely does not have the ability (or scale) to consume all EDR/endpoint events, leaving them largely </span><span data-contrast="auto">‘</span><span data-contrast="auto">endpoint-blind</span><span data-contrast="auto">’</span><span data-contrast="auto">. As more enterprise assets and applications move to the </span><span data-contrast="auto">cloud,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> we have yet a third source of high-value telemetry that must be available to SOC analysts for detection and investigation.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>To achieve the high-velocity goals of digital transformation, you need to improve your organization&#8217;s ability to consistently deliver customer value through shared processes.</p>
<p>Organizations that want to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/6-takeaways-how-forecast-value-devops-transformations" rel="noopener">accelerate value delivery</a> and improve collaboration, people, and teams traditionally have turned to published IT frameworks and models. But defining, documenting, and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/ai-ops-transform-it-tb/aiops-tools-implementation?lx=my3YKV&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">automating your processes</a> are not enough.</p>
<p>For shared organizational processes to be sustainable and improved over the long term, you need to establish effective, accountable, and scalable governance and ownership roles. And for these to be effective, you need to create a shared vision, a collaborative culture, effective teaming models, and a shared tooling strategy.</p>
<p>Effective process and practice ownership require interest, time, skills, knowledge, passion, and authority.</p>
<p>Several well-known frameworks address this issue. Lean Six Sigma and COBIT identify the process owner role as a critical control. <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/enter-nexus-ken-schwaber-scaling-scrum-future-agile" rel="noopener">Agile Scrum</a> says that while self-managed teams have roles with accountability for process elements, the product owner is responsible for product outcomes, while the Scrum master is responsible for the processes.</p>
<p>ITIL describes the need for governance roles, such as process owners and coordinators, to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/it-service-management-tb/it-tools-practices?lx=-rqtPA&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">improve the productivity of ITSM practices.</a> These roles focus on process design, communication, awareness, and process advocacy.</p>
<p>Here are five foundational capabilities that will help nurture and sustain <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-pandemic?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener">any digital transformation practice or shared objective</a>, across complex value chains consisting of internal and external service organizations.</p>
<h3>1. Leadership: Creating systems thinking and constancy of purpose</h3>
<p>Your behavior and choices reflect the environment you come from, which includes both good and bad attributes demonstrated by current and past organizational leaders.</p>
<p>The tone at the top primarily determines an organization&#8217;s culture, ethics, focus, drive, direction, and willingness to collaborate. Leadership either intentionally programs organizational culture or develops haphazardly through workers&#8217; beliefs and experiences.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a direct correlation between an organization&#8217;s results and its culture, while, conversely, the culture&#8217;s relationship to the organization&#8217;s beliefs and experiences reflects its leadership.</p>
<p>In turn, there&#8217;s a direct correlation between an organization&#8217;s ability to establish effective <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/units/how-governance-change-depend-your-business-processes" rel="noopener">process governance</a> roles and how that organization&#8217;s leaders work with their peers and teams. Organizations in which senior leaders visibly align around common objectives and demonstrate their commitment are better able to establish this role as well as create coherence and a common approach across teams.</p>
<p>Systems thinking and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/transformational-leadership-what-every-devops-leader-needs-know" rel="noopener">lean leadership practices</a> stress that for a complex system to gain overall speed and velocity, stakeholders must share common values, beliefs, practices, and priorities. A main role of lean leadership is to create a constancy of purpose within the value system.</p>
<p>While you can partially accomplish this by planning systems and focusing on organizational culture, it also depends on <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/why-value-stream-management-success-hinges-flow-governance" rel="noopener">process governance</a>—which in turn depends on a leadership team that helps create a systems-thinking culture.</p>
<h3>2. Culture: Moving from silo-based to collaborative relationships and shared goals</h3>
<p>Both human societies and organizations have natural boundaries where our concept of &#8220;us&#8221; ends and we consider all others to be &#8220;them.&#8221; While this is normal, challenges can arise when our sense of whom we self-identify with is too narrow. Systems thinking centers on sharing the same values, beliefs, practices, and prioritization of work to effectively achieve common goals.</p>
<p>Establishing efficient process governance structures that cross multiple teams is largely impossible when the sense of &#8220;us&#8221; is narrow and limited. Building an agreement for shared and common practices within your silo isn&#8217;t a problem, but introducing a common practice into other groups in a highly siloed culture becomes almost impossible due to cultural constraints.</p>
<p>The solution is to widen the sense of &#8220;us&#8221; through systems thinking to establish trust-based relationships that reduce silo thinking and move relationships from transactional to cooperative and, ultimately, collaborative.</p>
<p><em>Figure 1. Readiness for collaboration happens when both parties have built initial trust and are prepared to form a working relationship where individual goals and desires are willingly subordinated to a shared set of values, beliefs, practices, and priorities that can co-create value. Source:</em> <em>AXELOS</em></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-new-it4it-reference-architecture-game-changer" rel="noopener">ITIL 4 models</a> can help organizations create this larger sense of identity and systems thinking, while enabling a culture and willingness to collaborate across teams.</p>
<h3>3. Structure: Creating velocity through cross-functional teams</h3>
<p>Vertically oriented structures and management systems are often based on turn-of-the-century design principles that focused on task specialization. While creating localized specialization is important, it can also negatively affect cross-functional collaboration.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s fast-paced, highly automated business environment requires both increased speed to market and faster innovation, so leaders must find ways to increase collaboration, engagement, and creativity across teams using shared processes and tools.</p>
<p>Traditional, top-down organizational structures are experimenting with <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/project-management-surefire-way-kill-your-software-product" rel="noopener">product-oriented cross-functional teams</a> for both development and support. These concepts have been in place for decades in other verticals that have adopted lean manufacturing principles.</p>
<p>The principle of cross-functional collaboration is not new. Developing a project team of members with specializations means forming a temporary teaming structure that shares values, goals, priorities, and outcome-based measures for which they are mutually accountable.</p>
<p>Recent discussion in the IT community has centered on transitioning the project team to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/projects-products-what-it-means-why-it-matters" rel="noopener">a semi-permanent, cross-functional product team</a>. This is not a new concept; Agile Scrum describes the development team and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-recruit-great-scrum-master" rel="noopener">the Scrum master role</a>. DevOps literature describes a DevOps team as having both development and operations members on a product-oriented team.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While people describe DevOps teams as full-stack, this doesn&#8217;t represent how most organizations use them. Most teams labeled &#8220;DevOps&#8221; are silo-based.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creating a team structure that includes the right skills and specializations results in a culture of collaboration that reduces silos and establishes a larger sense of &#8220;us.&#8221; This ultimately makes process ownership roles such as the Scrum master more effective.</p>
<h3>4. Performance: Moving to shared outcome versus activity-based measures</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-agile-coaches-measure-high-performance-spotify" rel="noopener">Highly effective teams</a> have shared outcome-based measures, rather than individual activity measures.</p>
<p>What is measured is important and, in many organizations, current performance management systems are tied to vertical organizational structures. Teams and individuals are measured on individual activity versus shared process or product outcomes.</p>
<p>The problem is that traditional performance measurement systems often contradict the aim of creating shared process goals. This negatively affects process governance roles; ultimately, people pay attention to what they are measured on.</p>
<h3>5. Automation: Moving from best-of-breed point solutions to integrated suites</h3>
<p>The desire to use shared tools for shared processes is the final foundational requirement for creating effective process governance. Achieving this goal depends on the previous four enablers.</p>
<p>Vertical, silo-based organization and team structures drive the acquisition process for tools and how they&#8217;re used. This aligns with the DevOps community&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/collective-ownership/" rel="nofollow noopener">description of Conway&#8217;s Law</a>: &#8220;Any organization that designs a system (defined more broadly here than just information systems) will inevitably produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization&#8217;s communication structure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unless you align your organization&#8217;s leadership, culture, team structure, and measurement systems around systems thinking and shared processes, the likelihood of adopting shared tools is quite low. Most organizations preach integrated solutions to their customers, but when it comes to their own acquisition of IT tools, they prefer best-of-breed point solutions over integrated suites.</p>
<p>The use of shared tools comes back to leadership and culture. To address this, leaders and teams must first resolve the following five questions before sharing tools. Can they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agree to agree to agree? (Engage in systems versus silo thinking.)</li>
<li>Agree on one way to do something? (Reduce complexity and variability.)</li>
<li>Agree to focus on simplifying how that should be done? (Focus on value-added activities and reducing waste.)</li>
<li>Agree to use one tool for collaboration? (Move to common tools for each category to improve collaboration and reduce technical debt.)</li>
<li>Agree on an integrated solution over a best-of-breed point solution? (Help automate delivery pipelines via systems integration.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Digital transformation requires effective processes</h3>
<p>To move from a reactive and low maturity to an improved ability to deliver value consistently and reliably, your organization must establish effective process governance. Ownership roles need to define, deploy, sustain, and improve those processes to support your organization&#8217;s objectives.</p>
<p>For these roles to fulfill their mandate, you need to have the five critical foundational enablers described above. And for most organizations, there&#8217;s much work left to do.</p>
<p><em>Learn how to implement the five foundational enablers with Troy DuMoulin and his colleagues as they offer practical recommendations and approaches for success at Pink Elephant&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pinkelephant.com/en-us/PinkInAction/Home" rel="nofollow noopener">ITIL 4 in Action</a> online symposium</em>. <em>The event takes place February 22 and 23, 2021.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>If you read my previous blog, <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/fast-testing-multiple-browsers/" rel="noopener">Fast Testing Across Multiple Browsers</a>, you know that participants in the <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/modern-cross-browser-testing-report/" rel="noopener">Applitools Ultrafast Cross Browser Hackathon</a> learned the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applitools <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/product-ultrafast-test-cloud/" rel="noopener">Ultrafast Grid</a> requires an application test to be run just once. Legacy approaches require repeating tests for each browser, operating system, and viewport size of interest.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/cross-browser-testing/" rel="noopener">Cross browser tests</a> and analysis complete typically within 10 minutes, meaning that test times match the scale of application build times. Legacy test and analysis times involve several hours to generate results</li>
<li>Applitools makes it possible to incorporate cross browser tests into the build process, with both speed and accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, we’re going to talk about another benefit of using Applitools Visual AI and Ultrafast Grid: test code stability.</p>
<h2 id="h-what-is-test-code-stability">What is Test Code Stability?</h2>
<p>Test code stability is the property of test code continuing to give consistent and appropriate results over time. With stable test code, tests that pass continue to pass correctly, and tests that fail continue to fail correctly. Stable tests do not generate false positives (report a failure in error) or generate false negatives (missing a failure).</p>
<p>Stable test code produces consistent results. Unstable test code requires maintenance to address the sources of instability. So, what causes test code instability?</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anandbagmar/" rel="noopener">Anand Bagmar</a> did a great <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/uncover-flaky-tests/" rel="noopener">review of the sources of flaky tests</a>. Some of the key sources of instability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Race conditions – you apply inputs too quickly to ensure a consistent output</li>
<li>Ignoring settling time – your output becomes stable only after your sampling time</li>
<li>Network delay – your network infrastructure causes unexpected behavior</li>
<li>Dynamic environments – your inputs cannot guarantee all the outputs</li>
<li>Incompletely scoped test conditions – you have not specified the correct changes</li>
<li>Myopia – you only look for expected changes and actual changes occur elsewhere</li>
<li>Code changes – your code uses obsolete controls or measures obsolete output.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you develop tests for an evolving application, code changes introduce the most instability in your tests. UI tests, whether testing the UI or complete end-to-end behavior, depends on the underlying UI code. You use your knowledge of the app code to build the test interfaces. Locator changes – whether changes to coded identifiers or CSS or Xpath locators – can cause your tests to break.</p>
<p>When test code depends on the App code, each app release will require test maintenance. Otherwise, no engineer can ensure that a “passing” test omitted an actual failure, or that  a “failing” test indicates a real failure and not a locator change.</p>
<h2 id="h-test-code-stability-and-cross-browser-testing">Test Code Stability and Cross Browser Testing</h2>
<p>Considering the instability sources, a tester like you takes on a huge challenge with cross browser tests. You need to ensure that your cross browser test infrastructure addresses these sources of instability so that your cross browser behavior matches expected results.</p>
<p>If you use a legacy approach to cross browser testing, you need to ensure that your physical infrastructure does not introduce network or other infrastructure sources of test flakiness.  Part of your maintenance ensures that your test infrastructure does not become a source of false positives or false negatives.  </p>
<p>Another check you make relates to responsive app design. How do you ensure responsive app behavior? How do you validate page location based on viewport size?</p>
<p>If you use legacy approaches, you spend a lot of time ensuring that your infrastructure, your tests, and your results all match expected app user behavior. In contrast, the Applitools approach does not require debugging and maintenance of multiple test infrastructures, since the purpose of the test involves ensuring proper rendering of server response.</p>
<p>Finally, you have to account for the impact of every new app coding change on your tests. How do you update your locators? How do you ensure that your test results match your expected user behavior?</p>
<h2 id="h-improving-stability-limiting-dependency-on-code-changes">Improving Stability: Limiting Dependency on Code Changes</h2>
<p>One thing we have observed over time: code changes drive test code maintenance. We demonstrated this dependency relationship in the Applitools Visual AI Rockstar Hackathon, and again in the Applitools Ultrafast Cross Browser Hackathon. </p>
<p>The legacy approach uses locators to both apply test conditions and measure application behavior. As locators can change from release to release, test authors must consider appropriate actions.</p>
<p>Many teams have tried to address the locator dependency in test code. </p>
<p>Some test developers sit inside the development team. They create their tests as they develop their application, and they build the dependencies into the app development process. This approach can ensure that locators remain current. On the flip side, they provide little information on how the application behavior changes over time. </p>
<p>Some developers provide a known set of identifiers in the development process. They work to ensure that the UI tests use a consistent set of identifiers. These tests can run the risk of myopic inspection. By depending on supplied identifiers – especially to measure application behavior, these tests run the risk of false negatives. While the identifiers do not change, they may no longer reflect the actual behavior of the application. </p>
<p>The modern approach limits identifier use to applying test conditions. Applitools Visual AI measures the application response of the UI. This approach still depends on identifier consistency – but with way fewer identifiers. In both hackathons, participants cut their dependence on identifiers by 75% to 90% – basically, they used way fewer identifiers. Their code ran more consistently and required less maintenance.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>
<h2 id="h-implications-of-modern-cross-browser-testing">Implications of Modern Cross Browser Testing</h2>
<p>Applitools Ultrafast Grid overcomes many of the hurdles that testers experience running legacy cross browser test approaches. Beyond the pure speed gains, Applitools offers improved stability and reduced test maintenance.</p>
<p>Modern cross browser testing reduces dependency on locators. By using Visual AI instead of locators to measure application response, Applitools Ultrafast Grid can show when an application behavior has changed – even if the locators remain the same. Or, alternatively, Ultrafast Grid can show when the behavior remains stable even though locators have changed. By reducing dependency on locators, Applitools ensures a higher degree of stability in test results.</p>
<p>Also, Applitools Ultrafast Grid reduces infrastructure setup and maintenance for cross browser tests. In the legacy setup, each unique browser requires its own setup and connection to the server. Each setup can have physical or other failure modes that must be identified and isolated independent of the application behavior. By capturing the response from a server once and validating the DOM across other target browsers, operating systems, and viewport sizes, Applitools reduces the infrastructure debug and maintenance efforts.</p>
<h2 id="h-conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Participant feedback from the Hackathon provided us with consistent views on cross browser testing. From their perspective, participants viewed legacy cross browser tests as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Likely to break on an app update</li>
<li>Susceptible to infrastructure problems</li>
<li>Expensive to maintain over time</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, they saw Applitools Ultrafast Grid as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less expensive to maintain</li>
<li>More likely to expose rendering errors</li>
<li>Providing more consistent results.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-what-s-next">What’s Next</h2>
<p>What holds companies back from cross browser testing? Bad experiences getting results. But, what if they could get good test results and have a good experience at the same time? We ask participants about their experience on the Applitools Cross Browser Hackathon.</p>
