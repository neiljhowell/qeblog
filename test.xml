										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>Appium is an open source test automation framework for use with native, hybrid and mobile web apps.</p>
<p>It drives iOS, Android, and Windows apps using the WebDriver protocol and gives you the ability to automate any mobile app from any language and any test framework.</p>
<p>Appium released its first major version almost 7 years ago. Since then, Appium has rolled out a lot of new features and its automation backend architecture has evolved quite a lot. </p>
<p>That said, getting started with implementing automated tests and executing them using Appium the 1st time can be a daunting experience.</p>
<p>There are a lot of dependencies that need to be set up – node, android-command-line tools, appium, etc.</p>
<h2 id="h-appium-setup-scripts">Appium Setup Scripts</h2>
<p>In order to make this task easier, and avoid having to do this manually, one at a time, I have written a script that will help set the Appium-Android environment automatically for you. The script is available for Mac OSX and Ubuntu and will set up the latest available version of the dependencies &amp; appium itself.</p>
<p>You can find the scripts here:</p>
<p>MacOSX: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anandbagmar/AppiumJavaSample/blob/master/setup_mac.sh" rel="noopener">setup_mac.sh</a></p>
<p>Ubuntu: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anandbagmar/AppiumJavaSample/blob/master/setup_linux.sh" rel="noopener">setup_linux.sh</a></p>
<p>The mentioned setup scripts install all dependencies required for implementing / running tests on Android devices. To do the setup for iOS devices, run <strong><em>appium-doctor</em></strong> and see the list of dependencies that are missing, and install the same.</p>
<p>To ensure the setup is working properly, you can clone / download this sample repository (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anandbagmar/AppiumJavaSample" rel="noopener">https://github.com/anandbagmar/AppiumJavaSample</a>) which has 2 tests that can be executed to verify the setup. </p>
<p>Refer to the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anandbagmar/AppiumJavaSample/blob/master/README.md" rel="noopener">README</a> file for specifics of the prerequisites to do the setup and also for running the tests.</p>
<p>To get full value of your functional test automation, add the power of Visual AI to your tests. You can refer to the relevant tutorial for adding Applitools Visual AI to your Appium tests from <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h-summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Automate your Android and Appium test execution environment setup using an automated script on MacOSX (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anandbagmar/AppiumJavaSample/blob/master/setup_mac.sh" rel="noopener">setup_mac.sh</a>) and Ubuntu (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anandbagmar/AppiumJavaSample/blob/master/setup_linux.sh" rel="noopener">setup_linux.sh</a>).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />

<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>On February 17<sup>th</sup>, 2021, McAfee <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/dont-call-us-well-call-you-mcafee-atr-finds-vulnerability-in-agora-video-sdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">disclosed findings</a> based on a 10-month long disclosure process with major video conferencing vendor Agora, Inc.  As we disclosed the findings to Agora in April 2020, this lengthy disclosure timeline represents a nonstandard process for McAfee but was a joint agreement with the vendor to allow sufficient time for the development and release of a secure SDK. The release of the SDK mitigating the vulnerability took place on December 17<sup>th</sup>, 2020. Given the implications of <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/ApphMr2k5QE" rel="noopener noreferrer">snooping and spying on video</a> and audio calls, we felt it was important to provide Agora the extended disclosure time. The affected users of Agora include popular voice and video messaging apps, with one notable application being the popular new iOS app known as Clubhouse.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-117547 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1.png" alt="" width="403" height="660" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1.png 403w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-183x300.png 183w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-79x129.png 79w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px"/><br /><em>Clubhouse Application Screenshot</em></p>
<p>Clubhouse has made headlines recently as one of the newest players in the social networking sphere, rising in popularity after a series of high-profile users including Elon Musk, Kanye West and influencers in various geographies posted about the platform. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clubhouse_(app)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Released in April of 2020</a>, Clubhouse quickly carved out a niche in Chinese social media as the platform to discuss sensitive social and political topics – perhaps aided by its invite-only approach to membership – and the spotlight shined on it by these key players further propelled it into viral status early this year. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the application was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china-ban-clubhouse-reports-social-app-users-avoid-government-censorship-2021-2" rel="noopener noreferrer">blocked for use in China</a> on February 8<sup>th</sup>, 2021.</p>
<p>Last week, Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO) <a target="_blank" href="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/clubhouse-china" rel="noopener noreferrer">released research</a> regarding the popular Clubhouse app’s use of Agora real-time engagement software and suggested that Agora could have provided the Chinese government access to Clubhouse user information and communications.  While the details of Stanford’s disclosure focus on the audio SDK compared to our work on the video SDK, the functionality and flaw are similar to our recent disclosure, CVE-2020-25605.  This includes the plaintext transmission of app ID, channel ID and token – credentials necessary to join either audio or video calls. We can confirm that Clubhouse updated to the most recent version of the Agora SDK on February 16<sup>th </sup>– just a day prior to our public disclosure.</p>
<p>Despite the recent noise surrounding Clubhouse, the reality is that this application is just one of many applications that leverage the Agora SDK. Among others, we investigated the social apps eHarmony, Skout, and MeetMe, along with several widely-used healthcare apps, some of which have a significantly larger user base. For example, MeetGroup (comprised of several apps) reported approximately 18 million monthly users compared to Clubhouse, which had approximately 600k total users as of December 2020.</p>
<p>We felt it was important to highlight these data points and are continuing to investigate these applications as well as monitor any potential instances of malicious actors exploiting this vulnerability. Given that Agora has released an updated SDK that fixes the call setup issues, vulnerable applications should have already switched to the secure calling SDK, thus protecting the sensitive audio and video call data as many claim to do. With that in mind, we decided to check back in with some of the Agora-based apps we previously investigated to confirm whether they had updated to the patched version. We were surprised to see many, as of February 18, 2020, still had not:</p>

<div>
<p><strong>After Alex Birsan’s $130,000 bug-bounty haul last week,</strong> hundreds of bogus npm packages have popped up out of nowhere. They appear to have been published by copycat researchers—some of whom have less-than-pure intentions.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, it’s our old friend, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/check-your-dependencies-githubs-npm-finds-nasty-trojan-packages" title=" GitHub's npm finds nasty Trojan packages" rel="noopener">dependency confusion</a>,</strong> but this time with a twist. Birsan discovered a bunch of private module names and created aliases on public repositories, with higher version numbers.</p>
<p><strong>And, of course,</strong> that means he was running his code on other people’s networks. In this week’s <i><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/contributors/richi-jennings" rel="noopener">Security Blogwatch</a></i>, we get lost.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://richi.uk/" rel="noopener nofollow" title="Richi Jennings">Your humble blogwatcher</a> curated these bloggy bits for your entertainment. Not to mention: <em>Discombobulate.</em></p>
<h3>‘Now Publish Malware’ redux</h3>
<p><strong>What’s the craic?</strong> Careful with that Ax Sharma—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/copycats-imitate-novel-supply-chain-attack-that-hit-tech-giants/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Copycats imitate novel supply chain attack</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>This week, over 275 new packages have been published to the npm open-source repository named after private components being internally used by major companies. [The] packages are identical to the proof-of-concept packages created by Alex Birsan [who] recently managed to infiltrate over 35 major tech firms and walk away with over six-figures in bug bounty.<br />…<br />Birsan had taken advantage of an inherent design flaw of open-source development tools called &#8220;dependency confusion&#8221; or &#8220;namespace confusion&#8221; to squat names of private dependencies used by major companies on public open-source repos including npm, PyPI, and RubyGems. [He] hit over 35 tech firms, [including] Microsoft, Apple, PayPal, Tesla, Uber, Yelp, Shopify.<br />…<br />&#8220;It is … only natural to expect other bug hunters, or even malicious actors, to start uploading packages too now, and I have no control over what they do,&#8221; Birsan [said] in a statement. [He] believes these attacks are here to stay. … The possibility remains for such attacks to resurface and grow.<br />…<br />Companies should consider squatting their own private dependency names on public repos. … Also, the configuration of your development tools should be evaluated to ensure both private and public dependencies are not being inadvertently pulled from the public repository by default.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>And</strong> Dan Goodin adds—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/supply-chain-attack-that-fooled-apple-and-microsoft-is-attracting-copycats/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">New type of supply-chain attack</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Last week, a researcher demonstrated a new supply-chain attack that executed counterfeit code on networks belonging to some of the biggest companies on the planet, Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla included. Now, fellow researchers are peppering the Internet with copycat packages.<br />…<br />[Birsan’s] attack starts by placing malicious code in an official public repository such as NPM, PyPI, or RubyGems. By giving the submissions the same package name as dependencies used by companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, [etc.], Birsan was able to get these companies to automatically download and install the counterfeit code … by giving the packages version numbers that were higher than the authentic ones.<br />…<br />In other words, the researcher was squatting on the authentic package name belonging to the companies. [He] ended up receiving $130,000 in bug bounties. … Both Shopify and Apple awarded Birsan $30,000 bounties each.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>This has been a slow train coming</strong> for Alex Birsan—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">How I Hacked Into Apple</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Ever since I started learning how to code, I have been fascinated by the level of trust we put in a simple command like … <strong>pip install package_name</strong><br />…<br />When downloading and using a package from any of these … public code repositories … you are essentially trusting its publisher to run code on your machine. So can this blind trust be exploited by malicious actors?</p>
<p>Of course it can.</p>
<p></em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>See that light?</strong> Is it the end of the tunnel, or an oncoming express train? Microsoft suggests <i><a target="_blank" href="https://aka.ms/pkg-sec-wp" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">3 Ways to Mitigate Risk</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Many organizations use public package feeds — such as Maven Central, npm, NuGet Gallery, and the Python Package Index (PyPI). [But some] organizations fail to treat these uncurated feeds as a potential source of malware.<br />…<br />Unexplained build or test failures should be treated as a potential warning of a package substitution attack. [But] even though the build failed, the attacker likely achieved remote code execution.<br />…<br />1. Reference one private feed, not multiple: … Configuring the package manager to use only a single source isolates you from unexpected public feed changes. [But] ensure your feed is configured to disallow … public packages to override private packages.<br />…<br />2. Protect your packages using … controlled scopes, namespaces, or prefixes: The details vary by ecosystem, but the purpose is to protect a range of package names.<br />…<br />3. Utilize client-side verification features: … These include options such as version pinning and integrity verification.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Heed the work ethic of</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@markusdresch/wow-thanks-for-sharing-this-gem-ef2bedd9dae1" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Markus Dresch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I just finished reviewing and fixing all pipelines. Took me several hours, but hey — this vulnerability is so scary simple it just waits to be exploited.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>But are we asking the right questions?</strong> Let <i><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26090204" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">ryukafalz</a></i> ask you this:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Let me ask you this: Why do we consider it acceptable that code you install through a package manager implicitly gets to do anything to your system that you can do? That seems silly! Surely we can do better than that?<br />…<br />In many cases, the dependencies you install don&#8217;t need nearly as much authority as we give them right now. Maybe some of these packages need network access … but do they need unrestricted filesystem access?<br />…<br />They don&#8217;t necessarily even need unrestricted network access either. What they&#8217;re communicating with is likely pretty well-known.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The problem is endemic.</strong> Or so says <i><a target="_blank" href="https://linux.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=18033396&amp;cid=60939058" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">vanyel</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Seems to me all too many things, particularly websites, fetch things from third parties on the fly, making them susceptible to compromise by things they have given up control over, whether it be security or gratuitous changes. Keeping the things you know work local will make things much more stable.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>oBvIoUsLy</em>, the answer is blockchain.</strong> Now, what was the question? <i><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26081713" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">codevark</a>’s</i> suggestion didn’t go down well on HN:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If each new package name were checked against an immutable blockchain of existing names, and was only allowed if it did not already exist either privately or publicly, would that help mitigate this issue?</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>But it’s turtles all the way down,</strong> screams <i><a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/supply-chain-attack-that-fooled-apple-and-microsoft-is-attracting-copycats/?comments=1&amp;post=39667516#comment-39667516" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">HYS</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>I have been bitten by this bug when trying to install a relatively unknown program from PyPI that had a even more unknown dependency. There happened to be another obscure package with the same name as that dependency, and my installation attempt was always trying to install that wrong one.<br />…<br />In the context of security, this becomes a more serious problem. Signing the packages, or using some sort of provider ID would sort out the duplicates.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>This is something J2EE did right.</strong> (I guess there had to be <i>something</i>.) Here’s a surprised <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@tomas.langer/i-was-expecting-that-exact-versions-should-be-used-coming-from-java-ecosystem-7942cae67f5c" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Tomas Langer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Coming from Java ecosystem … I was expecting that exact versions should be used. … Surprising how many modules depend on &#8220;latest&#8221; versions.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Meanwhile,</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://linux.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=18033396&amp;cid=60938826" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">brunes69</a></i> suggests a nice idea:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Umm, have these folks never heard of a local NPM registry? There are literally a dozen different solutions to choose from here. Do they think commercial vendors download all their NPM dependencies from the internet every time they build?</em></p></blockquote>
<h3>The moral of the story?</h3>
<p>Make sure the code you’re importing really is <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/check-your-dependencies-githubs-npm-finds-nasty-trojan-packages" title=" GitHub's npm finds nasty Trojan packages" rel="noopener">the code you <em>think</em> you’re importing</a>.</p>
<h3>And finally</h3>
