<p>What is refactoring? Do we, as testers, need to perform such a task? Why and when? And especially, how can we do it easily?</p>
<p>Listen to Senior Automation Engineer Corina Pip as she explains how IntelliJ can help us with this refactoring task, by highlighting areas that need improvement, or by automatically improving them.</p>
<p>This is a very hands-on, practical session!</p>
<p>Corina provided plenty of code examples, as she demonstrated — step by step — what needs to be improved and how we can easily make it happen.</p>
<p>Talking points included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why and when do we need to perform refactoring?</li>
<li>How did we get to this and what can we do to avoid it in the future?</li>
<li>A LOT of examples of how IntelliJ can help with this activity</li>
</ul>

<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<h2><strong>The Connected Lives of Babies: Protecting The First Footprints in the Digital World, Part One</strong></h2>
<p>A baby can leave their first footprints internet even before they’re born.</p>
<p>The fact is that children start creating an identity online before they even put a little pinky on a device, let alone come home for the first time. That “Hello, world!” moment can come much, much sooner. And it will come from you.</p>
<p>From posting baby’s ultrasound pic to sharing a video of the gender reveal celebration, these are the first digital footprints that your child will make. With your help, of course, because it’s you who’ll snap all those photos, capture all those videos, and share many of them on the internet. Yet even though you’re the one who took them, those digital footprints you’ve created belong to your child.</p>
<p>And that’s something for us to pause and consider during this wonderful (and challenging!) stretch of early parenthood. Just as we look out for our children’s well-being in every other aspect of their little lives, we must look out for their digital well-being too. Babies are entitled to privacy too. And their little digital lives need to be protected as well.</p>
<h3><strong>The connected lives of babies</strong></h3>
<p>Babies lives are more connected than you might think. Above and beyond the social media posts we make to commemorate all their “firsts,” from first solid food to first steps, there’s digital information that’s associated with your child as well. Things like Social Security Numbers, medical records, and even financial records related to them all exist, all of which need to be protected just like we protect that same digital information as adults.</p>
<p>Likewise, there’s all manner of connected devices like Wi-Fi baby monitors, baby sleep monitors, even smart cribs that sense restlessness in your baby and then rocks and soothes those little cares away. Or how about a smart changing table that tracks the weight of your child over time? You and your baby may make use of those. And because all these things are connected, they have to be protected.</p>
<p>This is the first of two articles that takes a look at this topic, and we’ll start with a look at making good choice about purchasing “smart devices” and connected baby monitors—each pieces of technology that parents should investigate before bringing them into their home or nursery.</p>
<h3><strong>Buying smart devices for baby, Part One: Connect with your care provider</strong></h3>
<p>As a new parent, or as a parent who’s just added another tyke to the nest, you’ll know just how many products are designed for your baby—and then marketed toward your fears or concerns. Before buying such smart devices, read reviews and speak with your health care provider to get the facts.</p>
<p>For example, you can purchase connected monitors that track metrics like baby’s breathing, heart rate, and blood-oxygen levels while they sleep. While they’re often presented as a means of providing peace of mind, the question to ask is what that biometric information can really do for you. This is where your health care provider can come in, because if you have concerns about Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), that’s a much larger conversation. Your provider can discuss the topic with you about and whether such a device is an effective measure for your child.</p>
<h3><strong>Buying smart devices for baby, Part Two: Do your security research</strong></h3>
<p>Another question to ask is what’s done with the biometric data that such devices monitor. Is it kept on your smartphone, or is it stored in the cloud by the device manufacturer? Is that storage secure? Is the data shared with any third parties? Who owns that data? Can you opt in or opt out of sharing it? Can you access and delete it as needed? Your baby’s biometrics are <em>highly </em>personal info and must be protected as such. Without clear-cut answers about how your baby’s data is handled, you should consider giving that device a hard pass.</p>
<p>How do you get those answers? This is another instance where you’ll have to roll up your sleeves and read the privacy policy associated with the device or service in question. And as it is with privacy policies, some are written far more clearly and concisely than others. The information is in there. You may have to dig for it. (Of note, there are instances where parents consented to the use of their data for the purposes of government research, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5718309/" rel="noopener noreferrer">such as this study</a> published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health.)</p>
<p>Related, here’s the advice I share on every connected “smart” device out there, from baby-related items to smart refrigerators: before you purchase, read up on reviews and comments from other customers. Look for news articles about the device manufacturer too. The fact of the matter is that some smart device manufacturers are much better at baking security protocols into their devices than others, so investigate their track record to see if you can uncover any issues with their products or security practices. Information such as this can help you make an even more informed choice.</p>
<h3><strong>Secure your Wi-Fi baby monitor (and other smart devices too)</strong></h3>
<p>An online search for “hacked baby monitor” will quickly call up several unsettling stories about hackers tuning into Wi-Fi baby monitors—scanning the camera about the room at will and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.11alive.com/article/money/consumer/louisville-family-baby-monitor-hacked-stranger/417-f803d099-c8f9-4111-9d3e-9629e3e536a7" rel="noopener noreferrer">perhaps even speaking directly to the child</a>. Often, this is because the default factory password has not been changed by the parents. And a “default password” may as well be “public password” because lists of default passwords for connected devices are freely available on the internet. In fact, researchers from Ben Gurion University looked at the basic security of off-the-shelf smart devices found that, “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-03/aabu-osd031218.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">It only took 30 minutes to find passwords for most of the devices and some of them were found only through a Google search of the brand</a>.”</p>
<p>The three things you can do to prevent this from happening to your Wi-Fi baby monitor, along with other connected devices around your home, are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Change the default password.</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe/?hilite=%27strong%27%2C%27passwords%27" rel="noopener">Use a strong and unique password</a> for your baby monitor and other devices.</li>
<li><strong>Update.</strong> Check regularly for device updates, as they often harden the security of the device in addition to adding performance upgrades.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use two-factor authentication if available. </strong>This, in addition to a password, offers an extra layer of protection that makes a device far more difficult to hack.</li>
</ul>
<p>What about “old-style” baby monitors that work on a radio frequency (RF) like a walkie-talkie does? Given that they’re not connected to the internet, there’s less risk involved. That’s because hacking into an RF monitor requires a per person to be in close physical proximity to the device and have access to the same broadcast frequency as your device—a far less likely proposition, yet a risk none the less. Some modern RF baby monitors even encrypt the radio signal, mitigating that much more risk.</p>
<h3><strong>And now, let’s talk about online privacy for babies and children </strong></h3>
<p>Next up, we’ll take a closer look at baby’s privacy online. Yes, that’s a thing! And an important one at that, as taking charge of their privacy right now can protect them from cybercrime and harm as they get older. Feel free to read on right here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>It’s been more than two years since we last evaluated <a target="_blank" href="https://info.applitools.com/uc2zs" rel="noopener">Cypress vs Selenium WebDriver</a>, and as we all know, a lot can happen in two years.</p>
<p>Since then, Selenium WebDriver has made impressive improvements as they prepare for the <a target="_blank" href="https://info.applitools.com/uc2zz" rel="noopener">major release of Selenium 4</a>, and Cypress has grown from its infancy phase. Let’s see what’s changed!</p>
<h2 id="h-target-audience">Target Audience</h2>
<p>In our previous post, we asserted that most of Selenium’s users are testers, while developers seemed to favor Cypress. While this was certainly true in its early days, <a target="_blank" href="https://info.applitools.com/uc2zQ" rel="noopener">the popularity of Cypress has increased with testers</a> as well. Cypress has become the most widely used test automation tool amongst our JavaScript users, which comprises mostly of dedicated automation engineers.</p>
<p>My theory for the uptick in the use of Cypress amongst testers is that collaboration is a key factor in tooling. It’s hard enough to get developers to contribute to UI testing, and if Cypress is a way to bridge that gap, then testers are all for it!</p>
<h2 id="h-language-support">Language Support</h2>
<p>Since Cypress was designed for frontend developers, it only supports JavaScript – the language of the web. This has not changed since Cypress was released, and it does not seem to be on the product’s roadmap. Consequentially, this puts Cypress at a disadvantage to Selenium which supports JavaScript as well as Java, Python, C#, Ruby, and Kotlin. This gives Selenium a much wider target audience, especially since <a target="_blank" href="https://info.applitools.com/uc2Ag" rel="noopener">Java is the most popular programming language for UI testing</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h-browser-support">Browser Support</h2>
<p>Arguably, the biggest enhancement to Cypress since our last post is its move from Chrome-only to cross browser support!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"/>
<p>Cypress’ lack of cross-browser support was a major con for those who needed to test their applications on more than just Chrome. Many Cypress users had to rely on third-party plugins such as <a target="_blank" href="https://info.applitools.com/uc27F" rel="noopener">Applitools’ Ultrafast Grid</a> to gain test coverage on multiple browsers.  However, with version 4 of Cypress, this now opens the possibility of <a target="_blank" href="https://cypress.io/blog/2020/02/06/introducing-firefox-and-edge-support-in-cypress-4-0" rel="noreferrer noopener">testing on Firefox and Edge</a> as well.</p>
<p>Of course, Selenium WebDriver has always supported Chrome, Firefox, and IE; and has also supported Edge and Safari for years. This gives Selenium an edge in this category for those who need to test on Internet Explorer and Safari (the default browser for iOS devices).</p>
<h2 id="h-browser-capabilities">Browser Capabilities</h2>
<p>The architecture for Cypress and Selenium varies quite a bit (see our <a target="_blank" href="https://info.applitools.com/uc2zs" rel="noopener">original comparison</a> for the details). Cypress runs tests in-browser while Selenium uses a browser driver. Both of these approaches have their pros and cons. </p>
<p>Cypress tests are faster since there are less processes to call for every browser interaction. However, features such as opening and manipulating multiple tabs and windows is not supported in Cypress. Likewise, Cypress has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cypress.io/blog/2020/02/12/working-with-iframes-in-cypress/" rel="noreferrer noopener">limited support</a> for working with iframes and requires you to write custom code to be able to do so.</p>
<p>Selenium users do not have to concern themselves with these limitations. Not only are iframes fully supported in WebDriver, but Selenium 4 boasts updated support for <a target="_blank" href="https://info.applitools.com/uc278" rel="noopener">multiple windows and tabs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h-server-manipulation">Server Manipulation</h2>
<p>In our previous post, we admired Cypress’ built-in support for mocking and intercepting server requests and responses. At that time, this powerful feature was not available in Selenium. However, Selenium 4 provides a brand new <a target="_blank" href="https://info.applitools.com/uc273" rel="noopener">Chrome DevTools Protocol API</a> which enables Selenium tests to not only mock server requests and intercept responses, but to fully leverage all of the possibilities of Chrome DevTools. This is a game-changing feature for Selenium WebDriver!</p>
<h2 id="h-which-is-better-selenium-or-cypress">Which is Better? Selenium or Cypress?</h2>
<p>That depends on your needs. </p>
<p>Cypress integrates quite nicely into a given production codebase making it favorable for developers, which therefore fares better for collaboration between developers and automation engineers/testers. Cypress’ architecture also inherently speeds up test execution.</p>
<p>However, Selenium has far more reach and support for browsers, programming languages, and browser capabilities. </p>
<p>If your application is relatively simple and speed and collaboration are the most important factors, then Cypress is a great choice. However, if your application and user journeys are more complex and require extensive testing across multiple platforms, then Selenium would be a better choice.</p>
<p>I applaud you for reading to the end! Tools have their intended purposes and while multiple tools may seem similar, we shouldn’t be so quick to label one tool as “better” than another. Evaluate any given tool against your requirements to determine which would be the most efficient for your needs. </p>
<p>I’m excited to see the progress in both Selenium WebDriver and Cypress over the last two years. Both are clearly here to stay!</p>

<p>This is the year to get down to business with cloud computing. It&#8217;s time to move from the hype-driven world of cloud migration—including <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/app-modernization-dx-tb/app-modernization-101?lx=my4KH8&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=WQDGNFY2037340&amp;_ga=2.80536343.188473915.1611057387-403716879.1610126925" rel="noopener">application modernization</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/about-digital-transformation?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener">digital transformation</a>—to the humbler world of long-term cloud-based systems operations. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where many IT shops stand today: Their organization moved to the cloud in a big way, and they now have a mix of cloud configurations—<a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/multicloud-vs-hybrid-cloud-management-top-approaches-tools" rel="noopener">whether they call it hybrid IT, hybrid cloud, or multicloud</a>—and the looming X-factor is how to manage the resulting complexity. They&#8217;re ready to set up standard operating procedures for long-term cloud operations. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s already clear that rapidly expanding cloud ecosystems are shaping up to be a <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/hybrid-multicloud-management-tb/manage-cloud-complexity?lx=ooPdGt&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">huge headache for IT in the coming yea</a><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/hybrid-multicloud-management-tb/ease-multi-cloud-management?lx=ooPdGt&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">r</a>. Success depends upon having an effective CloudOps strategy. You need an action plan to deal with everything from problem management to monitoring, security, and performance.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how your team can <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/hybrid-multicloud-management-tb/architect-manage-hybrid-multiclouds?lx=ooPdGt&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">better control cloud management issues at scale</a>, including <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/hybrid-multicloud-management-tb/ease-multi-cloud-management?lx=ooPdGt&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">what needs to be done now to ensure success</a>. </p>
<h2>CloudOps requires a reset</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s an uncomfortable truth: Most enterprises that migrated to cloud-based platforms, both public and private, did not focus on operations. Most transition teams believed that operations would be covered by the existing operational teams and that cloud computing systems would simply be another platform to be maintained, secured, and governed. </p>
<p>The enlightenment usually happens when enterprises are 30% to 40% migrated, both data and applications. Teams discover that approaches and technologies leveraged for traditional operations are unsuitable for use with cloud-based deployments. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering why, the answer lies with these three main factors:</p>
<h4>1. The remote nature of cloud-based platforms  </h4>
<p>Because cloud systems are out of the direct physical control of ops teams, special care must be taken in how they carry out operations. Typically, the ops team is dependent upon the cloud provider for all information, and the provider schedules and executes most platform-related fixes. </p>
<p>This lack of control actually contributes to the value of leveraging public cloud. You turn over most of the direct control to the public cloud provider, which typically involves relinquishing the time-consuming control of platforms down to the raw metal. In rare instances, it&#8217;s possible to maintain that control with some public cloud providers, but not many. </p>
<h4>2. Security is a shared responsibility </h4>
<p>Much like the issue above, responsibility for security operations (SecOps) needs to be partitioned between the enterprise CloudOps teams and the cloud provider. And this can get confusing, quick. </p>
<p>Most breaches that occurred within public clouds did not lack necessary security technology. Instead, there was a lack of understanding about the roles and responsibilities of each party. </p>
<p>If you want to review the legalese of this relationship, the particulars are spelled out in the agreements you accept (or accepted) before becoming your cloud provider&#8217;s customer. Today, it&#8217;s hard to find a CloudOps team member who has read and understands the legal jargon.  </p>
<h4>3. Teams can&#8217;t keep up with the number of new cloud services moving to production</h4>
<p>The &#8220;abundance of choice&#8221; or the need to select best-of-breed are the prime culprits of increased complexity that, in turn, the CloudOps team finds the most challenging. <a target="_blank" href="https://info.aptum.com/cloud-impact-study-1#whichcloud" rel="nofollow noopener">A report</a> by Aptum explains that abundance of choice typically results in a technological smorgasbord, where decoupled cloud dev and migration teams make their own calls around what technology to use.</p>
<p>Complexity naturally arises when it&#8217;s time to join and coordinate the multitudes of those apples and oranges, which come in every flavor and variety. </p>
<h3>Key tools and technology</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s time to recognize CloudOps as a new, separate discipline. Although many people had hoped to toss CloudOps in with traditional operations, the special needs of public cloud-based applications and data just won&#8217;t allow that strategy to succeed. Get comfortable with the idea that cloud requires a new set of concepts, approaches, and, yes, technologies. </p>
<p>Enterprises that have a set of ops tools and hope to extend them out to their newer public cloud platforms will find that the old tools won&#8217;t meet the changing requirements. Most ops teams will need to invest in new brands and technologies that make cloud and non-cloud operations specialized and separate, and thus more costly than expected.</p>
<p>The good news for CloudOps has been bad news for traditional enterprise IT Ops. No matter what report or metric you review these days, legacy systems do not get the investment they did just a few years ago. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudindustryforum.org/content/cloud-infrastructure-spend-surpasses-spend-legacy-it-finds-new-research-cif" rel="nofollow noopener">A report by the Cloud Industry Forum concluded</a> that UK organizations devote 19% of their IT budgets to cloud infrastructure, just ahead of the 18% spent on on-premises infrastructure, and that by 2022, just 12% of IT budgets will be spent on legacy technology, as cloud usage increases. Keep in mind, legacy systems still comprise the majority of <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/why-enterprises-are-adapting-their-cobol-apps-vs-ditching-them" rel="noopener">systems that run businesses</a>. </p>
<p>Among tool-makers, the lion&#8217;s share of R&amp;D investment is earmarked for CloudOps tool development. Obviously, this new focus comes at the expense of traditional ops tools, where users already see fewer updates and almost no innovation in on-premises systems operations technology. </p>
<p>The good news for those already in the cloud, or moving there, is that new categories of technology will be created around the emerging needs of CloudOps teams. This will include tools such as <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/ai-ops-transform-it-tb/aiops-essentials?lx=my3YKV&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">AIOps (artificial intelligence operations)</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb/release-managers-continuous-delivery?lx=-DC2cJ&amp;custom_url=continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener">CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous deployment)</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/infrastructure-code-engine-heart-devops" rel="noopener">IAC (infrastructure as code)</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/state-of-secops-tb/state-secops-202021-takeaways?lx=ipOpkU&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">SecOps (security operations)</a>, and MLOps (machine learning operations), just to name a few, all created specifically for the cloud.</p>
<p>The current state of the market makes it possible for those who support CloudOps to access special-purpose tooling, where the capabilities of CloudOps tools have surpassed the capabilities of traditional operations tools. But back on premises, the once unthinkable is becoming commonplace: Systems that run the majority of business processes are often the most neglected.  </p>
<h2>Steps to CloudOps success</h2>
<p>Your plan to succeed with CloudOps should include establishing approaches, playbooks, tool sets, skills, and ongoing processes to achieve sustainable long-term success. </p>
<p>Here are four emerging best practices that usually translate into an effective, optimized CloudOps enterprise. </p>
<h4>1. Include traditional systems in the CloudOps strategy and tooling, if possible</h4>
<p>Typically, this is not easy. There are paths to leverage the same operations approaches, including common SecOps processes and tooling, that may simplify enterprise IT operations overall. </p>
<p>However, in many instances, existing enterprise ops teams force common solutions and processes into places where they are not an optimized fit. While it&#8217;s more complex to keep different tools and skills around to support cloud and non-cloud systems, for the majority who approach CloudOps, there are no other options. </p>
<p>In this step, you&#8217;re determining if using a combined toolkit or processes is even a possibility. </p>
<h4>2. Promote data to become a first-class citizen  </h4>
<p>Data is often mixed in with general-purpose operations and approaches, including data that&#8217;s managed on public clouds. This is a big mistake. Consider the data—across platforms, across applications, even across clouds. </p>
<p>Managing data under a holistic and unified approach carries huge advantages. <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/key-requirements-successful-dataops-initiative" rel="noopener">The DataOps strategy</a> needs to be large and overarching, and then broken down into different approaches and tooling. This includes DataOps technology such as master data management (MDM), backup and recovery, data performance engineering, microservices, containers, serverless, and even data using cloud connected edge-based systems. </p>
<p>However, all should exist under a unified approach to DataOps that everyone on the ops teams understands. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-you-should-centralize-it-ops-destroy-data-islands" rel="noopener">Proper management of your data</a>, in the cloud and out, is about 75% of the CloudOps battle. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>3. Make security systemic throughout CloudOps </h4>
<p>While SecOps is part of CloudOps, there are many organizations that try to put SecOps, DataOps, NetOps, GovOps, etc., into their own silos. The trouble with that approach is that security needs to be a part of every aspect of CloudOps. Your workload security is only as effective as the most vulnerable component. </p>
<p>Even though SecOps should be centrally managed, the security systems leveraged in public clouds should be purpose-built for the application, data, systems, use case, etc. Yes, this means you&#8217;ll spend much more for cloud security than you might have anticipated, and, typically, the most secure cloud-based systems will also be the most complex. </p>
<h4>4. Place volatility and complexity into an operational domain </h4>
<p>The most successful CloudOps shops understand their underlying cloud-based services and how applications and data storage leverage those services. They also realize that cloud-based services will be in a constant state of change, pretty much forever. If you restrict change, the value of cloud computing goes down significantly. </p>
<p>Rather than limit change, learn to manage it effectively. The best practice here is to figure out where things change the most, such as database and development technology. Then learn how to leverage abstraction and automation to reduce the number of changes that need to be made to CloudOps processes and approaches. </p>
<p>For instance, leverage data services for all database access, no matter what technology or platform. This approach allows the actual database to change as often as needed, limiting the impact on applications or other entities that leverage data. This can be done for processes, DevOps tooling, and even operating systems. </p>
<h3>Get a clue, or buy one</h3>
<p>This year the alarm will sound around the importance of CloudOps. The fact that most enterprises have no clue as to how to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/cloudops-nirvana-achieve-continuous-ops-public-private-clouds" rel="noopener">properly implement CloudOps</a> will also come to light. </p>
<p>A few enterprises will react by slowing down their digital transformation efforts, which will allow ops to catch up. But if your enterprise ends up on that path, the above best practices were applied improperly or ignored altogether. You can count that as a fail. </p>
<p>If your enterprise does follow best practices, you will still need to remain vigilant to keep change and complexity issues under control. This is your mission, and with the proper planning and management, you will succeed.</p>
<h4>Keep learning</h4>
