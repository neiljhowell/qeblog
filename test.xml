										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>How far away are we from machines making safer software, faster? We might be closer than you think. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Other than ensuring that your people are happy and engaged, digital innovation is the best source of competitiveness and value creation for almost every type of business. As a result, three things are increasingly common among corporate software engineering teams and the 20 million software developers who work for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">They seek faster innovation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">They seek improved security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">They utilize a massive volume of open-source libraries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The universal desire for faster innovation demands efficient reuse of code, which in turn has led to a growing dependence on open-source and third-party software libraries. These artifacts serve as reusable building blocks, which are fed into public repositories where they are freely borrowed by millions of developers in the pursuit of faster innovation.</p>
<p>This is the definition of the modern technology supply chain—and more specifically, a <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/2019-state-software-supply-chain-report-5-key-takeaways" rel="noopener noreferrer">software supply chain</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Organizations that invest in securing the best parts, from the fewest and best suppliers, and keeping those components updated, are widening the gap against their competitors. The best-performing organizations are applying automation to help them manage their open-source component choices and updates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As these practices evolve, machines will become better at guiding developers to the best-quality and most secure component versions. And in the not-too-distant future, machines may be compiling the best components into application code based on functional requirements defined upfront.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here&#8217;s why automation should be a key strategy for helping you select open-source components, and other lessons from my team&#8217;s research.</p>
<h3>Beware of the proxies</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/2019-accelerate-state-devops-report-how-elites-drive-high-performance" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 2019 State of DevOps Report</a> found that elite organizations are deploying 200 times more frequently than their peers, and their change failure rates are seven times lower. They&#8217;re also much faster in mean time to recover from failure than other organizations.</p>
<p>But these kinds of metrics are really focused on how you&#8217;re doing internally as a development team and don&#8217;t take into account many external factors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This reminds me of what Jeff Bezos said in his 2017 letter to shareholders: &#8220;Beware of the proxies.&#8221; You can get so focused on a process, and doing that process well, that it becomes the thing that you&#8217;re trying to achieve.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You might be trying to achieve faster deployments, faster mean times to recovery, or more secure code releases. They can represent your proxies for success, while not necessarily contributing to the outcome your business is attempting to achieve.</p>
<h4>Who&#8217;s faster?</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Consider adversaries who attack your code. If you can release new security updates in your codebase within two weeks, but your adversaries can find and exploit the new vulnerabilities in two days, your organization&#8217;s data is at risk.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In this situation, it does not matter as much that you&#8217;ve already reduced your time to implement security updates fivefold if your adversaries are still faster.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Consider this real-world scenario. On Wednesday, April 29, 2020, the creators and maintainers of SaltStack, an open-source application, announced that the app had a critical vulnerability. On the very same day, they released the safe version of the application. If you had automatic updates turned on from SaltStack, you got the newer version. If you didn&#8217;t, then you needed to get the newer version, update your infrastructure, and do so before the adversaries found it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the researchers at F-Secure said that &#8220;the vulnerability was so critical, this was a patch-by-Friday-or-be-breached-by-Monday kind of situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s exactly what happened. By Saturday morning, May 2, some 18 people on GitHub reported that breaches were actively happening. They had lost control of their servers. SaltStack had been taken over, rogue code was executing on their systems, and their firewalls were being disabled. Throughout May, 27 breaches were recorded.</p>
<h3>Accelerate development</h3>
<p>But not all of the news is bad: We know that developers are getting faster, too, because they&#8217;re not writing all of their code themselves.<br /> </p>
<p><em>Figure 1: Number of download requests for Java component releases, 2012 to 2020, from the Central Repository. Source: 2020 State of the Software Supply Chain Report</em></p>
<p>We&#8217;re assembling more and more code from open-source components and packages. As one example, it&#8217;s amazing to look at download volumes for the npm package manager. There were 95 billion npm package downloads in July 2020. If you annualize that download volume, we would see over 1.1 trillion npm package downloads this year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In Java, similar things are happening. In 2019, Maven Central had 226 billion download requests. In 2020, download request volumes are expected to hit 376 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">How do these monstrous numbers translate to your own developers and applications? After analyzing 1,500 unique applications, we can see that 90% of their code footprint is built from open-source software components.</p>
<h3>Build the best code</h3>
<p>As I started thinking about all of the above, I wanted to understand not just how these parts are being used, but where they are coming from and who the open-source software suppliers are. So, in a two-year-long collaboration, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/RealGeneKim" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gene Kim</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-magill-2070a096/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stephen Magill</a>, and I examined software release patterns and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/open-source-risk-4-application-security-action-items" rel="noopener noreferrer">cybersecurity hygiene practices</a> across 30,000 commercial development teams and open-source projects.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We set out to understand what attributes we could use to identify the best open-source project performance and practices. If development teams were going to assemble applications from these building blocks, we wanted to understand who the best suppliers were.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We wanted to know who released most often, who were the most popular suppliers, who prioritized features over security or security over features, who enlisted automated build tools, which projects were consistently well staffed, and more. All of these variables played a role in identifying suppliers with the best track records, because they would be the ones to help developers build the best applications.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, the more you could teach machines to identify the attributes of the best open-source software suppliers for developers, the faster development could become.</p>
<h3>Lessons from our open-source projects</h3>
<p>The top-performing projects released 1.5 times more frequently than the rest of the teams we studied, were 2.5 times more popular by download count, had 1.4 times larger development teams, and managed 2.9 times fewer dependencies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We also saw a strong correlation between open source projects that updated dependencies more frequently and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/open-source-security-4-metrics-matter-app-sec-teams" rel="noopener noreferrer">their ability to maintain more secure code</a>. High-performing projects demonstrated a median time to update (MTTU) their dependencies that was 530 times faster than other projects. By moving to the latest dependencies, they purposely or consequently remediated known vulnerabilities discovered in older dependencies.</p>
<p><em>Figure 2: Open-source project cluster analysis of popularity and release speed. Source: 2019 State of the Software Supply Chain Report</em></p>
<p>To better understand all this, we performed a cluster analysis of these different open-source projects based on several attributes. We were able to see what development teams should focus on when choosing components.</p>
<p>Choosing open-source projects should be considered an important strategic decision for enterprise software development organizations. Different components demonstrate healthy or poor performance that affects the overall quality of their releases.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, MTTU should be an important metric when deciding which components to use within your software supply chains. Rapid MTTU is associated with lower security risk, and it&#8217;s accessible from public sources.</p>
<h3>Update your open-source components regularly</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Just as traditional manufacturing supply chains intentionally select parts from approved suppliers and rely upon formalized procurement practices, enterprise development teams should adopt similar criteria for their selection of open-source software components.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This practice ensures that the highest-quality parts are selected from the best and fewest suppliers. Implementing selection criteria and updated practices will not only improve code quality, but can accelerate mean time to repair when suppliers discover new defects or vulnerabilities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ideally, dependencies should be updated—simply, safely, and painlessly, and as part of the routine development process. But reality shows that this ideal is rarely met.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An astonishing story of how far an organization can stray from ideal update practices comes from <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/eileencodes" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Eileen M. Uchitelle</a>, staff engineer at GitHub, who said it took seven years to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIScxVu00bs" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">successfully migrate GitHub</a> from a forked version of Rails 2 to Rails 5.32.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even with new tools available to developers that automatically create pull requests with updated dependencies, changes in APIs and potential breakage can still hold back many developers from updating. We suspect this change-induced breakage is a primary driver of poor updating practices.</p>
<h3>A tale of three open source component releases</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Taking a deeper dive into the vast data available to us from the Central Repository, the world&#8217;s largest collection of open-source components, you can better visualize open-source project releases and their adoption by enterprise application development teams that migrate from one version to a newer one. We believe this data shows how open-source component selection can play a major role in allowing for easier and more frequent updates.</p>
<p><em>Figure 3: Migration patterns between component releases for the joda-time library. Source: 2020 State of the Software Supply Chain Report</em></p>
<p>Consider the widely used joda-time library, which shows that developers using this open-source component update fairly uniformly between all pairs of versions. This suggests that updates are easy, presenting a seemingly homogeneous set of versions to migrate to and from.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Figure 4: Migration patterns between component releases for the hibernate-validator library. Source: 2020 State of the Software Supply Chain Report</em></p>
<p>On the opposite extreme, consider the graph for the hibernate-validator library, where there are two sets of communities using it—one favoring version 5 and another preferring version 6. The two communities very rarely intersect. This suggests either that updating to version 6 from version 5 is too difficult or that the value is not worth the effort.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Figure 5: Migration patterns between component releases for the spring-core library. Source: 2020 State of the Software Supply Chain Report</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, we take a look at the pattern for spring-core, which suggests that updating is sufficiently difficult that the effort must be planned and some version ranges end up being avoided.</p>
<h3>Will machines make software?</h3>
<p>If you are a developer, don&#8217;t worry; your job is secure. No machine out there will take your place. Having said that, an increased reliance on automation to help you select better, higher-quality, and more secure components can serve you and your teams well today.</p>
<p>You can use automation, through advanced software composition analysis and open-source-governance tools, to point to better suppliers with a better track record—for instance, they release often, update vulnerabilities quickly, are well staffed, and are popular.</p>
<p>Using these tools to set policies around components can help you determine when to upgrade your dependencies, and they can quickly inform you of newly discovered vulnerabilities in need of remediation. Additionally, these tools can lead developers to the best versions of components, indicating which newer versions will introduce the fewest breaking changes or introduce troublesome dependencies.</p>

<div>
<p>Early January this year, Applitools announced the results of their<a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/hackathon-winners/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> </a><a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/hackathon-winners/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual AI Rockstar Hackathon winners</a> of which I am lucky to be included as one of their silver winners. I blogged about my experience as to how I approached the hackathon and my honest feedback as to why I think it’s modernising the way we do test automation which you can find in this post –<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mariedrake.com/post/applitools-modernising-the-way-we-do-test-automation" rel="noopener noreferrer"> </a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mariedrake.com/post/applitools-modernising-the-way-we-do-test-automation" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools: Modernising the way we do test automation</a>.</p>
<p>6 months in and they announced another hackathon but this time the focus is on cross browser testing via<a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/product-ultrafast-test-cloud/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> </a><a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/product-ultrafast-test-cloud/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultrafast Grid</a> and comparing it with traditional solutions such as running the same functional tests on different browsers and viewports locally. I participated in the hackathon again and ended up as one of their gold winners this time, which I’m extremely pleased, because not only did I win one of their amazing prizes but also, I improved my technical skill and learned a lot about the true cost of cross browser testing.</p>
<h2 id="h.bgexigit1a13">Why Automated Cross Browser Testing?</h2>
<p>First, let’s talk about why cross browser testing? Why another hackathon?</p>
<p>If you’re like me and have been testing web applications for some time, you’ll know that cross browser testing is a pain and time consuming to test. There is no way you can test 100% cross browser coverage, unless you have a lot of time and want to devote all your testing efforts in cross browser testing alone plus don’t forget that you also need to check on other viewports. In time, it gets really boring and tedious. This is why it’s a great idea to automate cross browser tests as much as possible so we can focus on other areas where we are also needed such as exploratory and accessibility testing.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there are not a lot of functional differences between different browsers. The code that gets deployed is mostly similar on any platform but the way the code is rendered visually exposes differences that we need to catch. Rather than doing cross browser functional testing where we are testing the functionality across different browsers, a better alternative is to do cross browser visual testing instead where we validate the look of our pages instead because this is what our users see.</p>
<p>The problem is automated cross browser testing, whether it’s functional or visual, can still take a considerable amount of time to set up because you need to create an automation framework that can scale and easily be maintained. This can be quite a challenge for testers who are considerably new in test automation.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>
<p>Cross Browser Testing in a nutshell</p>
<p>The purpose of this hackathon was to show how easy and how fast cross browser visual testing can be if you’re using modern tools such as Applitools. It’s also to highlight that existing testing tools are great for doing cross browser <em>functional</em> testing but not so great with cross browser <em>visual </em>testing which I’ll expand on later.</p>
<h2 id="h.k31gr9jtrxn7">The Hackathon Experience: Cypress</h2>
<p>The hackathon was split into automating three different scenarios for a sample e-commerce website called<a target="_blank" href="https://demo.applitools.com/gridHackathonV1.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"> </a><a target="_blank" href="https://demo.applitools.com/gridHackathonV1.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppliFashion</a>. The scenarios should be automated using any testing tool of your choice and also with the same testing tool but with using Applitools alongside. The automated tests will then be executed on two versions of the website – version 1, which is assumed to be bug free, and version 2, which has new bugs added in. On version 2, you have to update the automated tests to fix the bugs introduced and then compare the effort of doing this with the traditional testing tool that you have chosen as opposed to using Applitools.</p>
<p>I decided to use Cypress as my testing tool and while it’s a great tool for automating the browser, I spent 5.5 hours doing cross browser visual testing with this approach and still felt that I missed a lot of visual bugs. Let’s look at this in more detail.</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing Cypress: <strong>5 mins</strong></li>
<li>Writing tests for version 1: <strong>2 hours</strong></li>
<li>Test maintenance for version 2 and finding bugs: <strong>1 hour</strong></li>
<li>Test reporting and project refactoring: <strong>2 hours</strong></li>
<li>Documentation: <strong>30 mins</strong></li>
<li><strong>Total Time: 5 hrs, 35 mins</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Writing the tests took quite some time. I needed to verify a lot of the elements and get their selectors so I could assert that they were visible on the page. Some of the elements were hidden if you are on different viewports so these had to be reflected on the tests. You can find an example code on how I handled this on my<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mdcruz/applitools-ufg-hackathon/blob/master/TraditionalTestsV1/cypress/integration/task3.spec.js" rel="noopener noreferrer"> </a><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mdcruz/applitools-ufg-hackathon/blob/master/TraditionalTestsV1/cypress/integration/task3.spec.js" rel="noopener noreferrer">applitools ultrafast grid github repo</a>. The test execution time was also slightly longer because I had more viewports (desktop, tablet, mobile) and browsers (Chrome and Firefox) to cover locally.</p>
<p>When it was time to run the same test on version 2, I had to make some adjustments to my tests and log the bugs that my automated tests found. This took me an hour because I had to update the selectors to fix my tests but also, I wasn’t confident that my tests found all the visual bugs on version 2. I had to find some of the bugs manually since verifying CSS changes was difficult for me with just using Cypress alone.</p>
<p>When it came to test reporting and project refactoring, I invested 2 hours on this task. As I knew from experience, good reporting helps everyone make sense of test data. I wanted to integrate Mochawesome reporter so I could present the test results nicely to the hackathon judges. I wrote a tutorial on how to do this which you can find in this post –<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mariedrake.com/post/test-reporting-with-cypress-and-mochawesome" rel="noopener noreferrer"> </a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mariedrake.com/post/test-reporting-with-cypress-and-mochawesome" rel="noopener noreferrer">Test Reporting with Cypress and Mochawesome</a>. I also started noticing that my test code was getting a lot of duplication so I did some refactoring to clean up my automation framework.</p>
<h2 id="h.xfsxfxk9x2gl">The Hackathon Experience: Cypress with Applitools</h2>
<p>Now let’s look at how long it took me to do cross browser visual testing with Cypress and Applitools.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Applitools Cypress SDK: <strong>2 mins</strong></li>
<li>Setup project structure with Cypress and Applitools: <strong>10 mins</strong></li>
<li>Writing tests for version 1: <strong>20 mins</strong></li>
<li>Running tests for version 2: <strong>5 mins</strong></li>
<li>Bug reporting with Applitools: <strong>25 mins</strong></li>
<li>Documentation: <strong>10 mins</strong></li>
<li><strong>Total time: 1 hr, 12 min</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In total, I spent around just over one hour writing the tests for both version 1 and version 2 when using Cypress with Applitools. The time difference was massive! There were a few visual bugs that I missed that Applitools caught but even if this was the case, I didn’t have to rewrite my tests at all. All the adjustments were done on the Applitools Dashboard directly and marking the bugs through its annotation feature.</p>
<p>Writing the tests was considerably faster. As opposed to verifying individual selectors and checking that it’s visible, I took a screenshot of the whole page which is a better approach for visual validation.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1294" height="696" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-8.png" alt="carbon 8" class="wp-image-22988" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-8.png 1294w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-8-300x161.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-8-1024x551.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-8-768x413.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1294px) 100vw, 1294px"/></figure>
<p>Visual validation test with Cypress and Applitools</p>
<p>The code snippet above is simpler and will catch more visual bugs with less or even no test code maintenance.</p>
<p>So you might be wondering from the above code, how did I handle the cross browser capabilities? This was easily achieved by creating a file called <em>`applitools.config.js`  </em>on the root of your project and specifying the list of browsers that you want your tests to execute on. By utilising Ultrafast Grid and setting my concurrency to 10, I was able to run the tests quicker too.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1346" height="876" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-9.png" alt="carbon 9" class="wp-image-22989" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-9.png 1346w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-9-300x195.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-9-1024x666.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-9-768x500.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1346px) 100vw, 1346px"/></figure>
<p>Achieving Cross Browser Visual Testing with Applitools</p>
<h2 id="h.m35xq8vyzd1a">The Impact of Visual Cross Browser Testing for Testers</h2>
<p>Overall, this was another excellent hackathon from Applitools and showed that cross browser testing can be easy and fast. I’ve mentioned this in the past already that one of the trends that I’m seeing is more and more testing tools are becoming user friendly and if you are new to test automation, this is great news!</p>
<p>Also, from my experience, the production bugs that get missed most frequently are visual bugs. A test that hasn’t loaded any of its CSS files can still work functionally and your automated functional test will still pass. Rather than doing cross browser functional testing, it’s better to do cross browser visual testing to get maximum value.</p>
<p>Finally, the massive time saving that it provides means that we, as testers, have more time to explore the areas that automated tests can’t catch and that is a big win.</p>

<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<h2><strong>Announcing McAfee’s Enhanced Consumer Security for New Consumer Realities</strong></h2>
<p>With millions of people continuing to work and study remotely, scammers have followed them home—generating <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-quarterly-threats-july-2020.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">an average of 375 new threats per minute</a> so far this year. In response, our enhanced consumer portfolio directly addresses the new needs and new threats people face.</p>
<p>McAfee Labs found that these new threats via malicious apps, phishing campaigns malware, and more, according to its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-quarterly-threats-july-2020.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee COVID-19 Threat Report: July 2020</a>, which amounted to an estimated <a target="_blank" href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/federal.trade.commission#!/vizhome/COVID-19andStimulusReports/FraudLosses" rel="noopener noreferrer">$130 million in total losses in the U.S. alone</a>.</p>
<p>To help people stay safer and combat these threats, today we announced our latest consumer security portfolio. Our enriched products come with better user experiences such as a native Virtual Private Network (VPN), along with new features, including integrated Social Media and Tech Scam Protection—all of which are pressing security essentials today.</p>
<p>Specifically, our product lineup has been updated to include:</p>
<h3><strong>Boosts to security and privacy</strong></h3>
<p>Scams involving tech support and product activation have continued to sneak into people’s inboxes and search results, which require a critical eye to spot. Here are some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/top-tips-to-spot-tech-support-scams/?hilite=%27tech%27%2C%27support%27%2C%27scams%27" rel="noopener noreferrer">tips on how to identify these scams</a>. We’re making it easier for people to stay safer with new features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tech Scam Protection:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/safe-browser/mcafee-webadvisor.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee® WebAdvisor</a> now provides a warning when visiting websites that can be used by cybercriminals to gain remote access to your PC, helping combat the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/data-spotlight/2019/03/older-adults-hardest-hit-tech-support-scams" rel="noopener noreferrer"> $55 million total fraud loss in the U.S. due to tech scams</a>.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[While AIOps is increasingly taking center stage in industry discussions, and for good reason, there is also a great deal]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">While AIOps is increasingly taking center stage in industry discussions, and for good reason, there is also a great deal of confusion about it. Part of this is because the phrase &#8220;artificial intelligence for IT operations&#8221; often leads to debates that confuse use case and value with underlying technology capabilities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The other reason behind the confusion is the diversity of the AIOps market in terms of capabilities, focus, deployment requirements, direction, and overarching design.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As noted in EMA&#8217;s newly released Radar Report: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.enterprisemanagement.com/research/asset.php/3970/EMA-Radar-Report:-AIOps---A-Guide-for-Investing-in-Innovation" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AIOps—A Guide for Investing in Innovation</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Rather than [being] a market in the strictest sense, AIOps might be more accurately described as a &#8216;landscape&#8217; containing within it some rather startling surprises.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">The report examines 17 vendors in depth, based on extensive questionnaires and 31 deployment interviews, and provides the groundwork for the top 10 criteria. Here they are.</p>
<h3>1. Your key requirements</h3>
<p dir="ltr">EMA examined all 17 vendors across three use cases: incident, performance, and availability management; change impact and capacity optimization; and business impact and IT-to-business alignment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We saw striking differences in both focus and design relevant to these and related value propositions, such as integrated support for DevOps or SecOps. So the first thing to do is to understand and document your own unique top priorities before you go looking.</p>
<h3>2. Heuristic range</h3>
<p dir="ltr">While this could be a data scientist&#8217;s extravaganza, EMA evaluated this in large part based on four outcome-driven capabilities: anomaly detection, predictive insights, prescriptive insights (in which recommended actions are defined), and if/then analytics (if you make this change, then what will happen?).</p>
<p dir="ltr">By focusing on vendor strengths in each area, as they match your needs and readiness to go forward, you&#8217;ll have an excellent technical road map for AIOps selection.</p>
<h3>3. Integrated automation</h3>
<p dir="ltr">EMA has seen the handshake between analytics and automation as perhaps the single most transformative technology investment an IT organization can make. AIOps-related automation can be provided by the vendor, or via fully supported third-party sources, or through a mixture of both.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This automation can range from workflow to IT process automation to configuration automation to workload automation—as just four key examples.</p>
<h3>4. Required data and how it&#8217;s managed</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Not surprisingly, data is key for AIOps platforms to do their job well. This can typically include event, time-series data, log files, and other data such as configuration, topology, business-impact data, and even asset- and cost-related data.</p>
<h3>5. What&#8217;s already deployed</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Part of understanding your requirements involves getting a firm handle on what you already have deployed—what&#8217;s working well and the biggest gaps. Most AIOps platforms are designed to assimilate third-party tool sets and bring that data together, while supplementing with data collection capabilities of their own.</p>
<h3>6. Breadth of third-party integrations</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Across all 17 vendors, we saw a wide range in the number of supported integrations for third-party tool sets, from fewer than 10 to more than 100. These integrations typically include monitoring tools for infrastructure and application performance, automation options, IT service management (ITSM), and configuration management (including CMDBs), among other sources. </p>
<h3>7. Discovery and dependency mapping</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Another capability—either directly through the AIOps platform or through integrations—is support for discovery and dependency mapping for critical contextual insights. For instance, many of the platforms also support APM (application performance management) integrations for transaction-aware insights into application-to-infrastructure interdependencies.</p>
<h3>8. Deployment options</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Deployment options can significantly affect pricing, time-to-deploy, and administrative overhead. EMA looked for flexibility in spanning both SaaS and on-premises choices.</p>
<h3>9. Administrative overhead</h3>
<p dir="ltr">EMA’s research indicated a large delta in administrative overhead for ongoing support—not including initial deployment or significant upgrades. Basic ongoing support for an enterprise-size environment (10,000 employees of 5,000 managed entities) ranged from less than 0.5 of a full-time employee to three or more.</p>
<h3>10. Price</h3>
<p dir="ltr">While software costs are critical, they were rarely the most dominant factor in selecting an AIOps platform, based on our interviews. But when costs do inevitably come into play, it&#8217;s important to look at the larger context of administrative costs, deployment costs, and expected time-to-value, as well as the complexity affiliated with software licensing.</p>
<h3>Make <em>your</em> AIOps investment a success</h3>
<p>This list above provides a useful departure point for examining different AIOps platforms, but it&#8217;s also important to take the time to assess your own unique world.</p>
<p>What are your needs? Who are the most critical stakeholders? Where and how do they agree and disagree on their priorities? What process changes are likely to be needed? Do you have top-down executive support to help your IT organization evolve to work in new and more effective ways?</p>
<p>All these things may be relevant to making your AIOps investment a success.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>For deeper insights into what the data shows on how the AIOps market is evolving, with a fresh, in-depth look at all 17 vendors, read the EMA Radar Report: </em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.enterprisemanagement.com/research/asset.php/3970/EMA-Radar-Report:-AIOps---A-Guide-for-Investing-in-Innovation" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AIOps—A Guide for Investing in Innovation</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A guide to notable changes and deprecations for engineers looking to migrate from Selenium 3 to Selenium 4. There is]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<h2 id="h.trd73uc0493p">A guide to notable changes and deprecations for engineers looking to migrate from Selenium 3 to Selenium 4.</h2>
<p>There is huge excitement within the testing community since Simon Stewart, the lead of the Selenium project, announced the release of Selenium 4 with major changes and W3C standardization to the Selenium suite (Selenium IDE, Selenium WebDriver and Selenium Grid) during the official <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypmrrJmgM9U" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium Conference</a> 2018 at Bangalore, India.</p>
<p>As of early September 2020, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/" rel="noopener noreferrer">alpha version of Selenium 4</a> is available and can be downloaded to explore.</p>
<p>Manoj Kumar has already explained at a high level <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/selenium-4/" rel="noopener noreferrer">what’s new in Selenium 4</a>, and in this weekly blog series, we will discuss these features in detail with code snippets, benefits and possible use cases for the end users and well as the dev community who have built tools/products on top of Selenium.</p>
<p id="h.zac1ehcvyxfv">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the deprecated components and their replacements</li>
<li>Plan the migration from Selenium 3 to 4</li>
</ul>
<p>Selenium is a toolset for web browser automation that allows us to remotely control browser instances and emulate a user’s interaction with the browser. There are many changes in Selenium 4, the major being the W3C standardization, which implies that Selenium can be integrated with any software without any compatibility issues. Along with W3C standardization, there are few new methods added and deprecated/replaced.</p>
<p>Let’s discuss these in detail.</p>
<p>There are a couple of deprecations in Selenium 4. Let’s explore them.</p>
<h2 id="h.q3klgov012qo">FindsBy</h2>
<p>FindsBy interfaces are part of org.openqa.selenium.internal package having findElement(By) and findElements(By) methods, implemented by the RemoteWebDriver class. These are now deprecated as part of Selenium 4.</p>
<p>This is an internal change and does not impact end users, however if you have a product or tool built on top of Selenium APIs, have a look into these changes.</p>
<p>The By class can be used with findElement(By) and findElements(By) just like before.</p>

<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/ShamaUgale/0c2e9174680b510315f3feb24c9d4366.js</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h.jg0o7c8ahn0b">Actions</h2>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/interactions/Actions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Actions</a> class is a user-facing API for emulating complex user gestures like hovering, mouse movements, etc.</p>
<p>A few new methods have been added to the Actions class as a replacement of the classes under package org.openqa.selenium.interactions:</p>
<h3 id="h.mj2yxzjlz2t2">click</h3>
<p>A new method click(WebElement) is added to Actions class and is a replacement of moveToElement(onElement).click() and is used to click on an element.</p>
<h3 id="h.2mygl0gk2upp">clickAndHold</h3>
<p>Similarly, clickAndHold(WebElement) is used to click on an element without releasing and should be used as an replacement of moveToElement(onElement).clickAndHold()</p>
<h3 id="h.2qa0whoeiwd">contextClick</h3>
<p>contextClick(WebElement) is a replacement of moveToElement(onElement).contextClick() which was used to right click on an element.</p>
<h3 id="h.wmeymwc5pkoq">doubleClick</h3>
<p>doubleClick(WebElement) is used to double click on an element and is a replacement of moveToElement(element).doubleClick().</p>
<h3 id="h.tusoyvtzya5w">release</h3>
<p>release() is used to release the depressed left mouse button at the current mouse location. This was earlier part of org.openqa.selenium.interactions.ButtonReleaseAction class, and is now moved to Actions class.</p>
<h3 id="h.4s0zg88lo54k">Examples</h3>
<p>The below example demonstrates the usage of Actions methods discussed in Selenium 3 from line 17 to 33.</p>
<p>These methods can be replaced as shown in the below code snippet as part of Selenium 4 implementation from line 37 to 53.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/ShamaUgale/8e5a355017397ad12fd45d0819304ea5.js</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h.fcin1oerapqt">FluentWait</h2>
<p>The methods withTimeout() and pollingEvery() from FluentWait class have been changed. Now both methods accept a single parameter java.time.Duration in replacement of two parameters int and TimeUnit. Lets see the usages.</p>
<p>In the Selenium 3 example below, we see on line 6, the pollingEvery() method takes two parameters int and TimeUnit and can be imported from the package java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit. On line 7, withTimeout() also accepts int and TimeUnit as parameters.</p>
<p>Selenium 4 has replaced the TimeUnit with Duration and here is the sample code snippet demonstrating it. On line 12, pollingEvery() method now accepts only one parameter, Duration.</p>
<p>The Duration class can be imported from the java.time package and has methods to represent time duration in nano, millis, seconds, minutes, hours, days and so on.</p>
<p>In our example we have used ofMillis(int) and ofSeconds(int) methods.</p>
<p>Similarly, on line 14 withTimeout() method accepts Duration as a parameter.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="h.ldz60qiklzam">Driver Constructors</h2>
<p>A couple of driver constructors have been deprecated. Namely, the ones that accepted Capabilities objects have been replaced with ones that accept Options.</p>
<p>This means you will need to create a specific Options object for whichever Driver class you’re using, set your requirements and pass this object to the Driver constructor.</p>
<p>Examples for each of the drivers can are below</p>
<h3 id="h.9xw0f7uoe1lc">ChromeDriver</h3>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"></figure>
</div>
<p>ChromeDriver(Capabilities) is replaced by ChromeDriver(ChromeOptions).</p>

<h2 id="h.3bst29ontuje">Summary</h2>
<p>We went through the major deprecations in Selenium 4 and have outlined the ones that are important for end users in their migration from Selenium 3 to 4.</p>
<p>The list of all deprecations can be explored in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/deprecated-list.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium WebDriver API docs</a>. There are considerable internal interfaces, classes and ENUMs deprecated which have no impact on end users but may be of importance to vendors of tools and products built on top of Selenium.</p>
<p>In the next post of this series, we will explore the newly added features offered in Selenium 4 and the benefits they provide.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>When your team moves to a cloud testing solution like Sauce Labs, creating a solid, secure connection is likely to be a top priority.  One of the solutions to this challenge is Sauce Connect proxy. This is a command line tool that your team can use to create a TLS tunnel from your environment out to Sauce. This can be used to test applications that are not publicly facing; for example, if your team needs access to a local host system or a dev or staging environment. So rather than completely change your setup, you can easily download the proxy from Sauce Labs and run your tests from those internal environments. </p>
<p>Having this kind of structure in place gives your team confidence that the applications you&#8217;re testing are secured and easily accessible through Sauce Labs. As a best practice, you should use an identifier for the tunnel. This will assign the tunnel a name which you can use while executing tests so you’re able to tell the tunnels apart. This means you won’t have to constantly update tunnels IDs to replace the random identifier that Sauce Labs assigns. Instead, your  tunnel IDs can be passed as a capability to any test.</p>
<p>If you’re new to setting up proxy tunnels via the cloud, please take a look at one of our Tech Tip videos below. Senior Solutions Engineer Stan Williams walks you through the process of setting up Sauce Connect, how to point it at Sauce Labs, and best practices to follow.</p>
<div class="video">
<p><iframe title="Setting Up Sauce Connect - Sauce Tech Tip" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m2u1Gy14r9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
</div>
<p><b>Best Practice Alert: Keep Sauce Connect Up To Date! </b></p>
<p>Once you’re well established in using Sauce Connect, it’s a good idea to keep your version up to date in order to ensure a more secure and efficient testing practice. To help provide our customers with the most secure testing experience, we will be eliminating our support for Self Signed Certificates, and instead allowing for only Public Certificate Authority Signed Certificates. To achieve this, we are in the process of deprecating all versions of Sauce Connect prior to 4.6.x. If you are using an older version of Sauce Connect, we highly recommend you take a few minutes to download and <a target="_blank" href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwiki.saucelabs.com%2Fdisplay%2FDOCS%2FDownloading%2BSauce%2BConnect%2BProxy" rel="noopener noreferrer">install this update</a>. We also have helpful documentation on <a target="_blank" href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwiki.saucelabs.com%2Fdisplay%2FDOCS%2FBasic%2BSauce%2BConnect%2BProxy%2BSetup" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to set up Sauce Connect</a> that should make this process as smooth as possible. If applicable, please also ensure you are using the latest version of the Sauce Labs Jenkins plugin.</p>
<p>For further information on how to easily set up Sauce Connect, check out our <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.saucelabs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> and our <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Sauce+Connect+Proxy+FAQs" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ page</a>. Happy testing!</p>
