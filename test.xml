<h2 id="h.ep69ae7wwxsl">The Next Generation of Cross Browser Testing is Ultrafast.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our hackathons were created to make a point. There is a better way to automate your testing. Browsers do not suffer from the same executional bugs that plagued them five, 10, or 20 years ago. What does create problems, lots of problems, is the rendering of the application across various viewports and screens. This reality means amajor shift in how you need to test, and you will learn and see for yourself what we mean by competing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Ultrafast Cross Browser Testing Hackathon, even more valuable than the prizes you might win, is the learning you will gain from competing. If you take on this challenge, you will learn how next generation cross browser testing works. If you want a quick summary — read this this blog post on <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/next-generation-cross-browser-testing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">next generation cross browser testing.</a> </p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why participate in the Applitools Cross Browser Testing Hackathon?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, you will learn new skills. You get hands-on experience seeing how easily you can run tests once and evaluating behavior across the browsers that matter to your customers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, you experience a new way of running application validation. If you have your own multi-browser lab today, or if you use a third-party service that requires multiple tests run on multiple setups in parallel, you can see the difference in running the Applitools Ultrafast grid in comparison. And, if you have not considered running tests across multiple browsers – due to cost or complexity – you can reevaluate your decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, you can win prizes and bragging rights as a hackathon winner. To show the world, we will proudly display your name on our website. Your success will demonstrate your engineering acumen to your peers and anyone else that matters to you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p>
<div>
<p>How can you ensure that <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-pandemic?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">your organization</a>’​​​​​​<a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-pandemic?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">s digital transformation succeeds</a>? Some answers are easy—but can be dangerous. Others are harder, but are more likely to lead to success. Which answers are right for your organization as you progress on <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-roadmap?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">your digital transformation journey</a>? </p>
<p>Let’s start with the easy answers first.</p>
<p><em>[ <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/digital-transformation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get up to speed on digital transformation</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide. Plus: Get IDC&#8217;s &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-idc?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Transformation 2020 Top 10 Predictions</a>&#8221; ]</em></p>
<h3>1. Focus on rituals and ceremonies</h3>
<p>The simplest thing to do is to establish as your bible one of the hundreds of books on agile development, lean methods, or <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/devops-must-reads-practitioners-share-top-books" rel="noopener noreferrer">DevOps adoption</a>. Make it the one true source of your best practices.</p>
<p>If you’re taking a more hands-on approach, you might anoint one person to be your coach, or &#8220;high priest,&#8221; and then do what that person tells you. There are standards for sprint length and backlog size and there are frameworks—<a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/units/scaling-agile-overview-frameworks" rel="noopener noreferrer">so many frameworks</a>: SAFe and LeSS, and dynamic systems development method (DSDM).</p>
<p>Your teams will go to stand-ups every day, and hold grooming sessions, and invite you to sprint reviews. The problem is that, although they will look agile, there is no guarantee they will <em>be</em> agile. Far too often this focus on form gives you the same slow, unresponsive results you had before, only dressed up in agile clothing.</p>
<h3>2. Track and trace the team</h3>
<p>Agile methods, particularly Scrum, give you lots of <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/9-metrics-can-make-difference-todays-software-development-teams" rel="noopener noreferrer">tools for measuring progress</a>: burnup charts, backlogs, velocity, story points completed, and so on. Software vendors are only too pleased to sell you tools that track, graph, slice, and dice these metrics, or provide similar ones for DevOps and lean approaches, and tell you how performance stacks up against last week or the industry average.</p>
<p>These tools are great at producing management fodder and the illusion of control. Unfortunately, high scores and pretty graphs don’t mean your team is delivering agile results, and you can nail your metrics and estimates every sprint right up to the moment you deliver a disappointing pile of useless features.</p>
<p>The central reason these approaches don’t pay off is that they focus on what is easily seen and monitored by the managers at the top, avoiding the hard work of cultural change and commitment that happen at the team level.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jamesshore" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">James Shore</a> calls these approaches &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Cargo-Cult-Agile.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cargo Cult Agile</a>.&#8221; Like the primitive people who started superstitiously donning coconut headphones and signaling nonexistent planes in the hope they would bring them modern goods, adopters of these methods are copying agile actions and tools and hoping that will give them agile results. This hope is just as forlorn as it sounds, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucerogers/2016/01/07/why-84-of-companies-fail-at-digital-transformation/#7ad5cf16397b" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">84% of digital transformations that fail</a> are witnesses to it.</p>
<p>We wrote our book, <em><a target="_blank" href="https://itrevolution.com/agile-conversations" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Agile Conversations</a>,</em> to propose and explain how to implement a harder answer, we use a method we have seen give dramatic results in team after team.</p>
<p><em>[ Find out <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/robotic-process-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to roll out Robotic Process Automation</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide. Plus: Download <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/robotic-process-automation-tb/enterprise-rpa-requirements?lx=jNs_Bd&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enterprise Requirements for RPA</a> ]</em></p>
<h3>The harder answer: Build trust and reduce fear</h3>
<p>Hold difficult conversations with your team. Build trust by sharing your own reasoning and inquiring into the inferences and theories of your team members. Having built mutual trust and understanding, you can move to revealing and mitigating the fears that hold back your team, and come to understand the assumptions behind those fears.</p>
<p>Only after addressing these cultural issues can you—with the help of the participants—expect to benefit from an agile framework or a DevOps approach that fits your organization well and has your team members’ commitment.</p>
<p>If improving your conversations sounds like a challenging route to digital transformation success, good! You’ve understood why we warned you it was the hard answer. But the good news is that there are solid, concrete methods for preparing for and holding these difficult conversations, starting with <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.communicationtheory.org/conversation-analysis/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">conversational analysis</a>.</em></p>
<p>To create a conversational analysis, think of a previous conversation that went poorly, or one you are worried about having—any conversation that raises questions of trust and fear would be a good candidate. Divide a piece of paper into two columns; on the right, put the words that you and the other person said (a sample of a few key lines is plenty), and on the left, put the thoughts and feelings that you had as the corresponding lines were spoken.</p>
<p>Once you’ve recorded the information, it’s time to score yourself for <em>transparency</em> and <em>curiosity</em>, the two key elements of effective conversations.</p>
<h4>Curiosity</h4>
<p>On the right, circle all the question marks in sentences spoken by you. If there are any questions (often there won’t be, revealing a total lack of curiosity!), reflect on whether each question was genuine. Could the answer have changed your mind, or were you leading the witness and making a disguised statement (&#8220;Surely we can finish that feature by Thursday.&#8221;)?</p>
<h4>Transparency</h4>
<p>On the left, underline each emotion or thought that you did not share on the right-hand side. You don’t have to have used the same words, but if you&#8217;re like most people (including us!) you’ll have left out your most valuable, strongest feelings and ideas, missing the chance to show vulnerability and build trust.</p>
<h3>Take the next steps</h3>
<p>Finally, revise your conversation to increase your curiosity and transparency. Add a genuine question, describe a feeling, or bring up a challenging example. Ask a friend to role-play the revised conversation with you, so you can solidify your learning and find a natural way to express yourself in the more effective way you’ve now learned.</p>
<p>If you and your team develop conversational skills in this way—and build on them with other techniques like test-driven development for people (for more on this, watch <a target="_blank" href="https://douglassquirrel.s3.amazonaws.com/Squirrel-AgilePortugal2016.mp4" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Douglas</a>’<a target="_blank" href="https://douglassquirrel.s3.amazonaws.com/Squirrel-AgilePortugal2016.mp4" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> presentation</a>) and <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jeffreyfredrick.com/2016/04/08/coherence-busting-explained/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">coherence busting</a> that start with conversational analysis—you will be able to approach future conversations effectively.</p>
<p>In these ways, the harder answer, the true path to agile success, will not seem so daunting. And you’ll be able to engage in all the conversations we cover in <em>Agile Conversations</em>, not just trust and fear, but why, commitment, and accountability.</p>
<p>With the help of these key conversations you’ll be able to create a real transformation that works for everyone, and with the buy-in you need to succeed. It’s the harder path, but it’s the only one we know that works every time.</p>

</p>
<div>
<p>In this series of Selenium 4 articles, we will look into the entire <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium</a> suite. The suite includes Selenium IDE, Selenium WebDriver, and Selenium Grid. Each component has something new that is useful for automation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Selenium IDE</u></strong> allows us to record, playback the recording, edit, and debug our test.</li>
<li><strong><u>Selenium WebDriver</u></strong> is an API that executes our test by driving a browser for automating an Application Under Test (AUT).</li>
<li><strong><u>Selenium Grid</u></strong> executes our test across multiple browsers, operating systems, and machines.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can look at Selenium as a family of products. Our test can be recorded in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium IDE</a> then executed using <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2017/11/28/inside-selenium-webdriver/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium WebDriver</a> and scaled up utilizing <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/07/16/using-selenium-grid-and-remote-webdrivers/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium Grid</a>. The Selenium 4 pre-release version is available from <a target="_blank" href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-java" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maven’s Repository</a>. By the end of this series, you will read updates concerning Selenium IDE, Selenium WebDriver, and Selenium Grid.</p>

<h2><a target="_blank" id="Selenium_IDE" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Selenium IDE</strong></h2>
<p>Selenium IDE is open source and available to record then playback our test. The new name is called <strong>Selenium IDE TNG</strong> (The Next Generation). We can view it as the on ramp to the Selenium family for people without development experience.</p>
<p>Many people wondered what happened to the previous release. Unfortunately, Selenium IDE was only available through Firefox and used an XPI file. XPI is a cross platform compressed installation via Mozilla Application Suite. It stopped working after Mozilla changed from using the XPI file. In spite of the change, we can now download Selenium IDE TNG via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/</a> as a <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/selenium-ide/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selenium-ide/mooikfkahbdckldjjndioackbalphokd" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome</a> extension. The extension is available as a Web Extension but will be available as an Electron app. Electron apps allow us to use the Debugging Protocol.</p>
</p>
<p><noscript><img class="alignnone wp-image-12340 size-medium" title="Selenium IDE" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.1-Selenium-IDE-512x143.jpg" alt="Selenium IDE" width="512" height="143" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.1-Selenium-IDE-512x143.jpg 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.1-Selenium-IDE.jpg 641w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"/></noscript></p>
<p>Also, we can extend Selenium IDE with the use of plugins. Plugins are good for introducing new commands or integrating with a 3<sup>rd</sup> Party. In addition to the plugins and available for multiple browsers, Selenium IDE TNG has the following features:</p>
<h3><a target="_blank" id="Backup_Element_Selectors" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backup Element Selectors</h3>
<p>Backup Element Selectors is when Selenium IDE records multiple locators for each element. Some examples of locators are ID, XPath, and CSS selector. Imagine a scenario where our test passes as expected, then an update is performed on the application. Depending on the update, the test will fail because Selenium cannot locate the element.</p>
<p>Not anymore <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Now our test will pass after an update. If test execution does not locate an element then it will fall back to a different locator until the element is found. Thanks to Backup Element Selectors, one element contains more than one locator.</p>
<h3><a target="_blank" id="Control_Flows" rel="noopener noreferrer">Control Flows</h3>
<p>Control Flow statements help Selenium IDE know the execution order of instructions in our program. There are 2 types of Control Flows: <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#Conditionals" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conditionals</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#Loops" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loops</a>. Conditional statements decide what happens next if a specific condition is met or not met. Loop statements execute an instruction or instructions for a certain number of times.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" id="Conditionals" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Conditionals</strong></h4>
<p>The Conditional statements are if, else if, else, and end.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>if</u></strong> executes a statement when a condition is true.</li>
<li><strong><u>else if</u></strong> only executes a statement when the first if condition is false.</li>
<li><strong><u>else</u></strong> extends the if condition when the condition is false.</li>
<li><strong><u>end</u></strong> is a command that terminates the conditional block.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a target="_blank" id="Loops" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Loops</strong></h4>
<p>The Loop statements are do – repeat if, while, times, and forEach.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>do – repeat if</u></strong> starts with a do command and ends with a repeat if command. A block of statements is executed at least one time then evaluated to determine if they should execute again.</li>
<li><strong><u>while</u></strong> only executes a block of statements when the condition is true.</li>
<li><strong><u>times</u></strong> determine the number of times to perform a set of commands.</li>
<li><strong><u>forEach</u></strong> iterates over a collection and have a reference for each collection item.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each condition is verified using JavaScript expressions which can be implemented directly in the control flow command. We are allowed to use the execute script or execute async script commands to run JavaScript and store the result in a variable. Here’s a screenshot of some Control Flow statements:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-12341 size-full" title="Control Flow statements" alt="Control Flow statements" width="639" height="329" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.2-Selenium-Control-Flow.jpg 639w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.2-Selenium-Control-Flow-512x264.jpg 512w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.2-Selenium-Control-Flow.jpg"/></p>
<p><noscript><img class="alignnone wp-image-12341 size-full" title="Control Flow statements" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.2-Selenium-Control-Flow.jpg" alt="Control Flow statements" width="639" height="329" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.2-Selenium-Control-Flow.jpg 639w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.2-Selenium-Control-Flow-512x264.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px"/></noscript></p>
<h3><a target="_blank" id="Code_Export" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code Export</h3>
<p>Last but not least is Code Export which permits code to get pushed to Selenium WebDriver and use on Selenium Grid. The steps include right-clicking a test or suite, selecting Export, then picking a language/test framework and clicking the Export button. Currently, Selenium IDE TNG supports the following languages and test frameworks:</p>
<ul>
<li>C# / NUnit</li>
<li>C# / xUnit</li>
<li>Java / JUnit</li>
<li>JavaScript / Mocha</li>
<li>Python / pytest</li>
<li>Ruby / RSpec</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully, support for Java / <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/10/31/the-power-of-testng-test-next-generation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestNG</a> comes in the future.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-12342 size-full" title="Selenium 4 Code Export" alt="Selenium 4 Code Export" width="450" height="409" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.3-Select-Language.jpg"/></p>
<p><noscript><img class="alignnone wp-image-12342 size-full" title="Selenium 4 Code Export" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.3-Select-Language.jpg" alt="Selenium 4 Code Export" width="450" height="409"/></noscript></p>
<h2><a target="_blank" id="Selenium_Grid" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Selenium Grid</strong></h2>
<p>Selenium Grid supplies a way to set up an infrastructure of different browsers and operating systems on different machines. We can specify the browser, browser version, and operating system with Selenium Remote. The tests are distributed across multiple physical or virtual machines so they can execute in parallel.</p>
<h3>Modern</h3>
<p>The original Selenium Grid was released in 2011 and so much has changed with technology. For example, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/05/30/the-ultimate-docker-tutorial-for-automation-testing-using-testproject/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker</a> and Kubernetes have made technology more accessible. Docker allows us to run applications in containers instead of virtual machines. Kubernetes allows us to set up a grid of machines. As a result of Docker and Kubernetes, we can scale using a cloud infrastructure. The goal is for Selenium Grid 4 to take advantage of new technology features.</p>
<h3>New Architecture</h3>
<p>Currently, at start up, the Selenium stand-alone server goes down 1 of 2 code base paths. The divided code bases are getting addressed with a brand-new architecture for Selenium Grid 4. Its architecture includes 4 individual processes: Router, Distributor, Session Map, and Node.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Router</u></strong> listens to a new session request.</li>
<li><strong><u>Distributor</u></strong> selects a node to run a test.</li>
<li><strong><u>Session Map</u></strong> is responsible for mapping session ID to the node.</li>
<li><strong><u>Node</u></strong> is a machine for executing our Test Scripts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the operation of Selenium’s Grid 4 architecture. A message arrives to the router then pings the grid. The new session request goes to the distributor which contains a list of current nodes. It’s the distributor’s responsibility to select a node running in the system. After selecting a node to run our test, a session is started with the node. The node responds back to the distributor with a URL of the session app and returns control to the user.</p>
<p>Although the architecture is new, it is similar to the original architecture. Selenium 2 has a Node and Hub whereby the Hub consists of 3 processes (Router, Distributor, and Session Map). Therefore, Selenium 2 and Selenium 4 have the same processes but Selenium Grid 4 separated the Hub’s process.</p>
<h3>Observability</h3>
<p>Observability helps us to trace and log what’s going on with a condition. This leads to a straightforward debugging session with Selenium Grid 4. As a request comes in, there will be a trace ID to assist our debugging efforts. It will not be as difficult to track why certain conditions failed.</p>
<h2><a target="_blank" id="Selenium_WebDriver" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Selenium WebDriver</strong></h2>
<p>Selenium WebDriver is a collection of APIs used to automate the testing of a web application. The supported languages in alphabetical order are C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. Although, Selenium is a family of more than 1 product, when people only say Selenium, they are implying to Selenium WebDriver.</p>
<h3><a target="_blank" id="W3C_WebDriver_Protocol" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C WebDriver Protocol</h3>
<p>According to Simon Stewart, creator of Selenium WebDriver and Selenium’s Project Lead, the W3C WebDriver Protocol is the reason for upgrading to Selenium 4. There’s not much difference compared to the original JSON Wire Protocol. Here’s a screenshot of the JSON Wire Protocol (left) and W3C WebDriver Protocol (right).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-12343" title="JSON Wire Protocol" alt="JSON Wire Protocol" width="430" height="205" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.4-JSON-Wire-Protocol-512x244.jpg 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.4-JSON-Wire-Protocol.jpg 638w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.4-JSON-Wire-Protocol-512x244.jpg"/></p>
<p><noscript><img class="alignnone wp-image-12343" title="JSON Wire Protocol" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.4-JSON-Wire-Protocol-512x244.jpg" alt="JSON Wire Protocol" width="430" height="205" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.4-JSON-Wire-Protocol-512x244.jpg 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.4-JSON-Wire-Protocol.jpg 638w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"/></noscript>  <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-12344" title="W3C WebDriver Protocol" alt="W3C WebDriver Protocol" width="387" height="205" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.5-W3C-512x271.jpg 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.5-W3C.jpg 636w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.5-W3C-512x271.jpg"/><noscript><img class="alignnone wp-image-12344" title="W3C WebDriver Protocol" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.5-W3C-512x271.jpg" alt="W3C WebDriver Protocol" width="387" height="205" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.5-W3C-512x271.jpg 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.5-W3C.jpg 636w" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px"/></noscript></p>
<p>Notice, the JSON Wire Protocol Over HTTP has been removed from W3C WebDriver Protocol. That means information is not transferred over HTTP by sending HTTP Requests and receiving HTTP Responses. With Selenium 4, information is transferred directly back and forth from the client to the server without the JSON Wire Protocol.</p>
<p>An advantage involves testing applications that will execute more consistently between browsers. Kudos to <strong>W3C</strong>, an acronym for <strong>World Wide Web Consortium</strong> for developing web standards. A standardization of W3C promotes compatibility beyond WebDriver API implementations.</p>
<h3><a target="_blank" id="Chrome_DevTools" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome DevTools</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/11/26/next-generation-front-end-testing-using-webdriver-and-devtools-part-1/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome DevTools</a> are developer tools that’s built into the Chrome browser. They can help track what’s going on in the browser, diagnose problems, provide a direct communication line, and can be accessed when right-clicking the page then selecting Inspect. The following panels are displayed after selecting Inspect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elements – view the DOM and inspect an element.</li>
<li>Console – view messages and execute JavaScript.</li>
<li>Sources – contains 3 sections for navigating files, editing code, and debugging JavaScript.</li>
<li>Network – view and debug activities in the network.</li>
<li>Performance – monitor the load and runtime performance of a website.</li>
<li>Memory – track leaks and provide information how a page use memory.</li>
<li>Application – examine all loaded resources.</li>
<li>Security – inspect the security of a page by debugging issues.</li>
<li>Lighthouse – audit web application.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a class named DevTools which helps increase productivity with the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Viewing the DOM</li>
<li>Handling Developer Options</li>
<li>Adding Listeners</li>
<li>Creating a Session</li>
<li>Inspecting Network Activity</li>
<li>Emulating Network Connections</li>
<li>Measuring Performance</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-12345 size-full" title="DevTools Class" alt="DevTools Class" width="367" height="228" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.6-DevTools.jpg"/></p>

<h3><a target="_blank" id="ChromiumDriver" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChromiumDriver</h3>
<p>Selenium WebDriver uses a driver to manage each browser. ChromeDriver is an executable that Selenium WebDriver uses to control Google Chrome and EdgeDriver controls Microsoft Edge. Both drivers extend ChromiumDriver as an update in Selenium 4. The ChromiumDriver class has methods to create a connection with DevTools.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-12346 size-full" title="ChromiumDriver" alt="ChromiumDriver" width="458" height="96" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.7-ChromiumDriver.jpg"/></p>

<p>The Change Log for JavaScript indicates “Native support has been removed for Opera and PhantomJS as the WebDriver implementations for these browsers are no longer under active development. For Opera, users should be able to simply rely on testing Chrome as the Opera browser is based on Chromium …”.</p>
<p>For more information regarding Selenium 4, we can view the Change Log to see updates concerning each programming language:</p>
<p>This article discussed some of the upcoming features in Selenium 4: Selenium IDE, Selenium WebDriver, and Selenium Grid. The next article will have additional features for Selenium WebDriver. Stay tuned! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Dear Applitools Family,</p>



<p>We are deeply saddened by the events that have taken place in the United States. As a company, and as individuals, we must acknowledge and address them. But most importantly, we must do our part to support justice and equality for Black People.</p>



					</div>
					
<!-- /wp:more -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we endure the reality of a pandemic, we need to be our best selves. In fact, we’ve seen our best selves in medical professionals, first responders, friends, neighbors, and in each other. This is what makes the multiple acts of violence and social injustice against Black Americans impossible to ignore any longer. We now know, more than ever, how much better we can be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For centuries, Black Americans have suffered terribly, based solely on the color of their skin. This has gone on for far too long and simply hoping things will change is not enough. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>We all must stand for the Black Community to end the violence and help bring equality, justice and healing to our country. </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We know that lending support and standing with the Black Community is not enough. There is much more we all can do to change our culture, support the movement and continue to educate ourselves to help create a just and equal world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is why, moving forward, Applitools will enact the following policies to support the Black Community:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Make and match donations from our team to organizations that support racial equality</li><li>Amplify the voices of Black Community members</li><li>Work to improve our team culture by taking deliberate actions to educate, train, create dialogue, and provide career opportunities for Black Community members </li><li>Support our employees in taking time to mentor and support non-profits focused on equality</li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Lastly, we want to acknowledge the strength, conviction, and wisdom of the Black Women, Aleeyah Dixon and Angie Jones, who are part of our family. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Angie and Aleeyah; we respect, love, and support you through this terrible time, and as a small company are privileged to have learned from you how to be our best selves. We want you to know that Applitools is your second home. A safe place. A place to find comfort and support.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In closing, we want to share some of the resources that Aleeyah and Angie have gathered for our team to help us understand and learn. It is our duty and responsibility to continue to educate ourselves. These valuable resources are yours to share so that we all better understand how to be active participants for positive change: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Let’s all commit to that change right now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yours In Peace, Love, and Unity,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Gil Sever,</strong> Co-Founder and CEO<br/>Applitools</p>
