					<description><![CDATA[The TestProject OpenSDK allows you to execute your Selenium and Appium tests using the power of the TestProject platform. This means]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>The TestProject <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/overview/sdk-v1-vs-opensdk-v2" rel="noopener">OpenSDK</a> allows you to execute your Selenium and Appium tests using the power of the <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener">TestProject</a> platform. This means you’ll benefit from automatic <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/executive-test-reports/" rel="noopener">test reporting</a> in HTML and PDF, automatic updates and configuration of your Selenium browser drivers, collaborative reporting dashboards, and much more, all using a single, free and open-source SDK. Recently, <strong>a new member of the OpenSDK family has been released: the TestProject C# OpenSDK</strong> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>In this article, we’ll take a look at how to get started with this brand new C# SDK. We’ll first see how we can convert an existing <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/category/selenium/" rel="noopener">Selenium</a>-based test to a TestProject-powered test, and then we will explore some of the reporting features of the SDK.</p>

<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="csharp-opensdk" rel="noopener">Installing the TestProject C# OpenSDK</strong></h2>
<p>The TestProject C# OpenSDK is 100% free and open-source and is available as a NuGet <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/TestProject.OpenSDK/" rel="noopener">package</a>.</p>
<p>When you add this package to your C# project, either through the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio or by using the command line, the SDK, as well as its dependencies, will be added to your project or solution.</p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="agent-and-dev-token" rel="noopener">Configuring your TestProject Agent and Developer Token</strong></h2>
<p>As with the other TestProject OpenSDKs (<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/getting-started-with-testproject-python-sdk/" rel="noopener">Python</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/12/14/easily-create-mobile-testing-framework-with-java-and-appium/" rel="noopener">Java</a>), tests are run using the <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/6TWgSBPP2YU" rel="noopener">TestProject Agent</a>, which takes care of browser driver detection, installation and configuration and sends reports to TestProject Cloud. The TestProject Agent can be downloaded from <a target="_blank" href="https://app.testproject.io/#/agents" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>By default, the SDK will communicate with the Agent on its default address, which is <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:8585" rel="noopener">http://localhost:8585</a>. If you’re running the Agent on another port, or even an entirely different machine, you can configure the correct address by setting the TP_AGENT_URL environment variable to the correct address.</p>
<p>After installing and registering the Agent (watch <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/6TWgSBPP2YU" rel="noopener">this</a> great quick video to see it in action and learn even more about the Agent’s power), you will also need to generate and configure a developer token. You can get this token from <a target="_blank" href="https://app.testproject.io/#/integrations/sdk" rel="noopener">https://app.testproject.io/#/integrations/sdk</a> and either set it in the TP_DEV_TOKEN environment variable, or pass it explicitly in your test code when you create a new driver.</p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="selenium-test" rel="noopener">Creating and running your first test</strong></h2>
<p>Now that all setup work is done, let’s take the C# OpenSDK for a spin <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f938-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="🤸‍♂️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Here is an example test, using Selenium and the <a target="_blank" href="https://nunit.org/" rel="noopener">NUnit</a> unit testing framework, that opens the <a target="_blank" href="https://example.testproject.io/web/" rel="noopener">TestProject demo application</a>, logs in, and checks that a greeting message is displayed:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="csharp">namespace TestProject.OpenSDK.Examples.NUnit&#13;
{&#13;
    using NUnit.Framework;&#13;
    using OpenQA.Selenium;&#13;
    using TestProject.OpenSDK.Drivers.Web;&#13;
&#13;
    [TestFixture]&#13;
    public class ExampleTest&#13;
    {&#13;
        private ChromeDriver driver;&#13;
&#13;
        [SetUp]&#13;
        public void StartBrowser()&#13;
        {&#13;
            this.driver = new ChromeDriver();&#13;
        }&#13;
&#13;
        [Test]&#13;
        public void ExampleTestUsingChromeDriver()&#13;
        {&#13;
            this.driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("https://example.testproject.io");&#13;
            this.driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector("#name")).SendKeys("John Smith");&#13;
            this.driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector("#password")).SendKeys("12345");&#13;
            this.driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector("#login")).Click();&#13;
&#13;
            Assert.IsTrue(this.driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector("#greetings")).Displayed);&#13;
        }&#13;
&#13;
        [TearDown]&#13;
        public void CloseBrowser()&#13;
        {&#13;
            this.driver.Quit();&#13;
        }&#13;
    }&#13;
}</pre>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> For those of you that are familiar with developing Selenium-based tests in C#, this code will probably be easy to understand. The most important thing is that we use the <strong>ChromeDriver class</strong> <strong>from the TestProject OpenSDK</strong>, rather than the same class from Selenium itself. This is <strong>the only thing you need to change</strong> in your existing tests to start using the power of the <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener">TestProject platform</a>.</p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="test-reports" rel="noopener">Inspecting the test reports</strong></h2>
<p>Once your TestProject Agent and the corresponding development token have been configured, the Agent will <strong>automatically</strong> report your test results to the TestProject cloud. After running the above test, if you go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://app.testproject.io/#/reports" rel="noopener">Reports</a> tab, you’ll see a project called ‘NUnit’:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Note: The C# OpenSDK supports <strong>automatically inferring project and job names for all major C# unit testing frameworks</strong>, i.e., <strong>MSTest</strong>, <strong>NUnit</strong> and <strong>xUnit.NET</strong>. The project name, unless explicitly specified, is the last section of the namespace that the current test is in (hence in this case ‘NUnit’). The automatically inferred job name is the name of the class that the test method is in, in this case, ‘ExampleTest’.</p>
<p>If you open this ‘NUnit’ project, you’ll see the ‘ExampleTest’ job, corresponding test executions, and the tests that have been run as part of these:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-17408 size-full" title="TestProject Reports - NUnit Selenium C# Reports in Cloud" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/report_details-1.png" alt="TestProject Reports - NUnit Selenium C# Reports in Cloud" width="1857" height="697" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/report_details-1.png 1857w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/report_details-1-512x192.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/report_details-1-768x288.png 768w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/report_details-1-1024x384.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1857px) 100vw, 1857px"/></p>
<p>As you can see, adding the OpenSDK to our C# Selenium-based test and running it through the TestProject Agent produced a <strong>detailed report containing all the driver commands</strong> that were executed during this test.</p>
<p>Like the other OpenSDKs, the TestProject C# OpenSDK offers a variety of options to <strong>customize your reporting</strong>. These options have been described in an <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/27/html-test-reports-for-selenium-and-appium-python-test-automation/" rel="noopener">article</a> covering the Python OpenSDK. All options and settings described in that article are available in the C# OpenSDK, too.</p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="specflow" rel="noopener">SpecFlow support</strong></h2>
<p>An incredibly exciting feature of the TestProject C# OpenSDK is that it does not only support the major C# unit testing frameworks MSTest, NUnit, and xUnit.NET, but that it offers cloud reporting of <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/11/21/get-started-with-specflow-in-your-test-automation-project/" rel="noopener">SpecFlow</a>-based tests, too. What exactly this entails, you will read in an upcoming article, coming soon! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f51c.png" alt="🔜" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="summary" rel="noopener">Summary</strong></h2>
<p>As we’ve seen in this tutorial, with just <strong>one unified SDK</strong> (that’s also available in <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/opensdk-v2/java-sdk" rel="noopener">Java</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/opensdk-v2/python-sdk" rel="noopener">Python</a>, by the way), <strong>developers and testers receive a go-to toolset, solving some of the greatest challenges in open-source test automation</strong>. Using this SDK will save you a lot of time, with the following benefits that come out of the box:</p>
<p>* Open source and available as a Maven dependency / a NuGet package / a PyPI project.<br />* 5-minute simple Selenium and Appium setup with a single Agent deployment.<br />* Automatic test reports in HTML/PDF format (including screenshots and customization capabilities).<br />* Collaborative reporting dashboards with execution history and RESTful API support.<br />* Always up-to-date with the latest and stable Selenium driver version.<br />* A simplified, familiar syntax for both web and mobile applications.<br />* Complete test runner capabilities for both local and remote executions, anywhere.<br />* Cross-platform support for Mac, Windows, Linux, and Docker.<br />* Ability to store and execute tests locally on any source control tool, such as Git.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the ever-changing world of development, new tools are constantly popping up to help developers create and manage complex solutions]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>In the ever-changing world of development, new tools are constantly popping up to help developers create and manage complex solutions with the ultimate goal of building a great experience for their customers.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a tool to help that developer become more productive or an entirely new way of thinking about the architecture of the project, developers are able to spend more time focusing on the unique parts of our code and focus on that great experience.</p>
<p>But as technology and tools evolve, we’re often facing the reality that with those new powers, we can support more platforms and more experiences, adding more overhead to ensuring the quality of the product remains high.</p>
<h2 id="h-how-does-graphql-help-developers-scale-to-more-platforms">How does GraphQL help developers scale to more platforms?</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://graphql.org/" rel="noopener">GraphQL</a> is a query language for APIs that allow developers to request only the parts they need from large amounts of data. This includes the ability to create complex queries across different databases, that may previously have required multiple REST API requests to fulfill.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em><em>Describe your data, ask for what you want, and get predictable results with GraphQL</em></em></p>
<p>With the ability to query for only the data you need, Front End Engineers and App Developers have an easier time managing that data, being able to create lean interfaces with reduced complexity. This helps reduce both up front cost (from a money and time perspective) and maintenance cost.</p>
<p>As that time starts to free up, it becomes more realistic that those developers can support additional interfaces, creating more opportunity to support more platforms.</p>
<h2 id="h-how-can-more-platforms-put-you-at-risk">How can more platforms put you at risk?</h2>
<p>The ultimate goal of adding your product to more platforms is that you can provide a better experience for your customers. Having a native application on iOS and Android allows developers to tap into the resources and features of those devices, allowing people to become more productive with those apps.</p>
<p><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0-3.png"/></p>
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Leveraging GraphQL to manage content for multiple platforms</em></p>
<p>But every platform that’s added to your product offering creates additional overhead for the team that’s testing those platforms, whether that’s a single developer or a larger team of Quality Engineers. If your testing process can’t scale to meet the needs of the platforms offered,</p>
<p>This isn’t meant to deter someone from moving to new platforms, but it’s a reality that should be considered before making that jump. What options do we have to mitigate these concerns, scale our testing solutions, and maintain confidence in our platforms?</p>
<h2 id="h-how-can-visual-regression-testing-help-you-scale-your-testing-strategy">How can Visual Regression Testing help you scale your testing strategy?</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/visual-testing/" rel="noopener">Visual Regression Testing</a> is an automated testing strategy that uses real-world screenshots of your application to ensure your product is working the way it should. It helps you gain confidence with how your application’s front end without having to spend time writing tests that end up testing the same things as your back end.</p>
<p>Starting with a baseline image, every time you trigger a new test, a new snapshot will be compared to the baseline image to see if anything changed, immediately flagging any discrepancies that could mean a feature regression or an issue with the user experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0-2.png"/></p>
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Applitools Eyes highlights the visual difference between the baseline and the most recent snapshot</em></p>
<p>The best part about Visual Regression Testing is it often leads to reduced testing overhead, as there’s much less code required to test a wider surface area of an application or website. These tests are also less fragile, as they don’t require code-specific selectors that could break if a developer decides it’s time to refactor.</p>
<p>While Visual Regression Testing alone is a great way to level up your testing plan, most solutions will compare those snapshots pixel-by-pixel without any sort of intelligence in those comparisons. This can mean you’re getting failed tests due expected changes like content updates that are expected in any application lifecycle.</p>
<p>Applitools leverages the<a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/applitools-ai-and-deep-learning/" rel="noopener">power of Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI) to give Visual Regression Testing superpowers, giving your tests the ability to actually understand what’s on the page.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0-1.png"/></p>
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Your app uses the Applitools SDK to extract screenshots and code to assess differences with Visual AI</em></p>
<p>If your content manager fixed a typo on a page, your tests are no longer getting flagged. If the product team just posted an update to the blog, you can be sure that you’re not spending time debugging failed tests, that Applitools can detect that it’s a content update, and not a layout regression.</p>
<p>On top of the benefits of AI, Applitools allows you to scale these tests across all of your platforms with its vast library of SDKs and the<a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/product-ultrafast-test-cloud/" rel="noopener">Applitools Ultrafast Test Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you’re trying to run your tests with Java or JavaScript, there’s an SDK that will let you easily hook into your favorite testing framework like<a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/selenium-java.html" rel="noopener">Selenium</a> and<a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/cypress.html" rel="noopener">Cypress</a>.</p>
<p>If you want Applitools to help cover a wide range of platforms, you can take advantage of the Ultrafast Test Cloud where you write your tests once and make sure all platforms are getting tested.</p>
<p><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pasted-image-0-1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Running tests on multiple platforms using Ultrafast Test Cloud</em></p>
<p>Being able to multiply the impact of each test you write can help you scale your testing strategy as you bring on more and more platforms to your product offering.</p>
<h2 id="h-grow-with-confidence">Grow with confidence</h2>
<p>As tools like GraphQL allow your business and product offerings to grow, don’t let testing strategies hold you back or worse, prevent you from testing at all.</p>
<p>By making sure you’re covering a wide range of platforms with Visual Regression Testing, you’re not only keeping your customers happy, you’re able to let Visual AI do the hard work and let you grow and remain confident that you’re maintaining a high level of quality for your business.</p>

<h2><span class="TextRun SCXW13657723 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"/><span class="TextRun SCXW13657723 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW13657723 BCX0">from</span></span><span class="TextRun SCXW13657723 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW13657723 BCX0"> McAfee’s Latest Report</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW13657723 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2}"> </span></h2>
<p>2020 was a year unlike any other. We transitioned from the corporate office to the home office, participated in distance learning, and figured out how to communicate with one another from afar. We sought out new forms of entertainment by streaming countless movies and TV shows and found new ways to stay active with at-home workouts. But none of this would’ve been possible without our devices and the technology we rapidly adopted.  In fact, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-covid-19-recovery-will-be-digital-a-plan-for-the-first-90-days" rel="noopener">data shows</a> that we accelerated five years forward in digital adoption during the first two months of the pandemic alone.  And according to findings from our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/52367395/en" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021 Consumer Security Mindset Report</a> , online alternatives will continue to replace activities in people’s lives and routines that were once in-person.</p>
<h3><strong>Online Alternatives Are Here to Stay </strong></h3>
<p>In the past year, many of us started to use or increased our use of various online tools. For example, online banking usage increased from 22% in 2020, online fitness classes increased by 7%, and virtual doctor’s appointments increased by 9%. We’ve adapted to the convenience of these online alternatives and have used them to replace activities that were once primarily in-person. Additionally, 77% of survey respondents indicated that they now use or have adopted common features designed for convenience, such as text and email notifications, web or mobile applications versus desktop sites, and more.</p>
<p>Online alternatives will continue to replace activities in people’s lives that were once in-person. According to our survey, the top digital activities that will remain part of our routines even as social distancing and stay-at-home restrictions lift include online banking, social engagements, and personal shopping. But as we continue to rely on technology to complete these tasks, how are we adapting our security habits to greater time spent online?</p>
<h3><strong>New Digital Worlds Also Means an Increase in New Digital Threats</strong></h3>
<p>The more time we spend online interacting with various apps and services, the greater our exposure is to potential cybersecurity risks and threats. So, as we continue to adapt to and embrace our new digital world, hackers are simultaneously taking notes. Survey results show that 71% of respondents are most concerned about their financial data being stolen or compromised, while 68% are concerned that their personal information could get hacked.</p>
<p>A heightened sense of security is of the utmost importance so we can continue to live our digital lives free from worry. But 29% of survey respondents don’t feel very confident about their ability to prevent a cyberattack and believe that they don’t have what they need to prevent one. And while another 40% is confident in their ability to prevent an attack, they think they could better understand how to identify or combat threats.</p>
<p>Even with these concerns, there still appears to be a discrepancy between our perceptions around online security versus our actions. While 70% of respondents stated that they purchased at least one connected device in 2020, only 50% bought security software, and only a quarter admitted that they check if their security software is up to date. But to preserve our digital wellness as we adopt new technology into our lives, we must upgrade our security habits in tandem. After all, it’s better to prevent a problem than be in a position of having to fix it.</p>
<h3><strong>Stay One Step Ahead of Hackers in 2021 and Beyond</strong></h3>
<p>To help prevent a hacker from striking, it helps to think about why they would want your data in the first place. However, over half of U.S. respondents admitted that they never considered how much their online data is worth. Hackers are always looking for ways to exploit others for money. By scavenging and stealing our personally identifiable information over the internet, hackers can piece together our identities – a valuable asset and can be sold for a lot of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/what-your-personal-identity-and-data-are-worth-on-the-dark-web/" rel="noopener noreferrer">cash.</a></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-116239 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NewDigitalYou_Infographic_800px_EN-US_fnl_optimized.jpg" alt="New Digital You Infographic" width="387" height="1920" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NewDigitalYou_Infographic_800px_EN-US_fnl_optimized.jpg 387w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NewDigitalYou_Infographic_800px_EN-US_fnl_optimized-26x129.jpg 26w" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px"/></p>
<p>To stay one step ahead of hackers and protect your digital wellness into the new year and beyond, continue to work on your own online habits and follow these security tips:</p>
<h3><strong>Use multi-factor authentication</strong></h3>
<p>Two or multi-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security, as it requires multiple forms of verification like texting or emailing a secure code to verify your identity. Most popular online sites like Gmail, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc. offer multi-factor authentication, and it takes just a few minutes to set it up. This reduces the risk of successful impersonation by criminals who may have uncovered your information by keyboard snooping.</p>
<h3><strong>Connect with caution</strong></h3>
<p>Hackers tend to lurk in the shadows on public Wi-Fi networks to catch unsuspecting users looking for free internet access. If you have to conduct transactions on a public Wi-Fi network, use a virtual private network (VPN) like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn/mcafee-safe-connect.html" rel="noopener">McAfee® Safe Connect</a> to help keep you safe while you’re online.</p>
<h3><strong>Browse with added security</strong></h3>
<p>Use a comprehensive security solution, like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee Total Protection</a>, which can help protect devices against malware, phishing attacks, and other threats. It includes <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/consumer/en-us/store/m0/catalog/mwad_528/mcafee-web-advisor.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee WebAdvisor</a>, which can help identify malicious websites.</p>
<h3><strong>Enable security settings</strong></h3>
<p>When using third-party tools like video conferencing platforms, adjust your security settings by password protecting your meetings and blocking other meeting attendees from sharing their screens. You can also adjust your device’s app permissions to only access your location when actively in use, or enable safe browsing options to protect you from malicious websites.</p>

<h3>New Year, New Digital You: Canadian Survey Findings from McAfee</h3>
<p>McAfee is headquartered in the U.S. and with our impressive global footprint protecting over 600 million devices protecting users’ connected lives isn’t just a priority for one location, but for the entire world that we serve.  As Site Leader of our Consumer Ontario offices, when it came time to reflect on the past year, we knew it was important to gather findings for the communities we protect including those in Canada.</p>
<p>In 2020, we abruptly transitioned from offices to home workspaces, participated in distance learning, and figured out how to stay connected with friends and family from afar. We sought out new forms of entertainment by streaming countless movies and TV shows and found new ways to stay active with at-home workouts. None of this would’ve been possible without our devices and the technologies we rapidly adopted. In fact, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-covid-19-recovery-will-be-digital-a-plan-for-the-first-90-days" rel="noopener noreferrer">data shows</a> that we accelerated five years forward in digital adoption during the first two months of the pandemic alone. And according to findings from our 2021 Consumer Security Mindset Report, Canadian consumers plan to stick with this digital-first lifestyle in the new year and beyond.</p>
<p>In the past year, many of us started to use or increased our use of various online tools. In Canada, online banking surged to 78%, personal shopping to 63%, and social engagements to 59%. We’ve adapted to the convenience of these online alternatives and have used them to replace activities that were once primarily in-person. In fact, 70% of survey respondents indicated that they now use or have adopted common features designed for convenience, such as text and email notifications, web or mobile applications versus desktop sites, and more.</p>
<p>Online alternatives will continue to replace activities in people’s lives that were once in-person. According to our survey, the top digital activities that will remain part of our routines even as social distancing and stay-at-home restrictions lift include online banking, social engagements, and personal shopping. But as we continue to rely on technology to complete these tasks, how are we adapting our security habits to greater time spent online?</p>
