<div>
<p>Incorporating analytics into the enterprise toolkit can be straightforward or complex, relatively inexpensive or a multimillion-dollar initiative. It all depends on what you want to accomplish.</p>
<p>Analytics is simply a set of practices designed to aid analysis. It can be as basic as creating a paper report that shows monthly snowfall in a particular region, a spreadsheet that uses formulas to calculate entries from columns A and F and then write the results to column Y, or the results of far more complex methods of data reading, sorting, and discovery. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/guide-to-modern-data-warehouse-tb/share-bi-resources?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign= 00174153" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big data analytics</a>, a subset of analytics overall, is about the process of managing and investigating large datasets, typically stored in a repository such as a data warehouse or data store. These may reside on one or more public clouds or on an organization&#8217;s own on-premises hardware.</p>
<p>The sources of that data can be nearly any kind of system. Traditionally, these sources provide structured data as <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/node/3949" rel="noopener noreferrer">described in this story</a>, including transactional (sales-related) data such as point of sale, inventory, customer relationship management, and records from related systems. Structured data also includes information from IT operational systems and machine data from sources such as remote sensors and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-tame-iot-guide-it-ops" rel="noopener noreferrer">other aspects of the Internet of Things</a>.</p>
<p>Less traditional is the storage of unstructured data for analytical purposes. Unstructured data—photos, video, audio, etc.—has been considered viable for analysis only over the past 15 years or so.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to know to start to make sense of all of your data.</p>

<h3>The modes of data query and analysis</h3>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt">Regardless of the data type, you store it to eventually learn what it may reveal. And you need an analytics process to help make sense of what&#8217;s there by asking questions that a database can interpret. This involves writing a query, done via a language that a database understands, such as SQL (Structured Query Language).</p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt"> </p>
<p>Querying a database via SQL long predates the big data phenomenon. SQL database vendors in the early &#8217;90s made it easier than it had been before for businesses to use SQL to understand trends in their acquired data. Another piece of this was also to create stored procedures that external applications could use to automate processing of back-end data storage and end-user results.</p>
<p>Nowadays, a big data query can certainly be an ad hoc question, because a business user might want to know how many bicycles he has sold to medium-income buyers in Illinois during the month of October.</p>
<h4><strong>Setting up standard queries</strong></h4>
<p>But a big data query is not always a &#8220;question&#8221; in the traditional sense of one that occurs to an analyst to ask relative to some emerging situation. Often, queries are set up to work automatically for routine reporting, or as some event triggers the need for analyzing the data on hand and producing some behavior.</p>
<p>In other words, standard queries can be set up to produce reports on a regular basis, for inventory and supply chain correlations, or about any number of routine operating statistics.</p>
<p>But standard queries can be set up for dynamic situations as well. Say a customer comes to your site and begins clicking on the images and high-level descriptions of bicycles you have for sale. A single click on a bike&#8217;s name and photo will take the customer to more details about the particular product.</p>
<p>But that same click can cause a variety of related items to display in the margins of the page—helmets, toe clips, side packs, lights, and other accessories. Most of us have experienced this kind of automated behavior when interacting with a commercial web page.</p>
<p>In this example, a user&#8217;s click on a specific bike triggers a preset query that&#8217;s designed to read a database of related items and display those items for the user to consider. Simple enough.</p>
<p>Now, imagine this is a returning customer, George, and you have some data accumulated on him—one or more items he&#8217;s bought in the past, or items he moved to the shopping cart but didn&#8217;t purchase, or any items clicked on during past site visits. In this case, you have even more intelligence regarding what to display in your margins for George.</p>
<p>That means your preset query not only returns items related to George&#8217;s current search, but items that specifically match his past behavior, and possibly his continued interest.</p>
<h3>Analytics&#8217; role in tracking consumer behavior</h3>
<p>Keeping track of consumer behavior is how video or music services make movie and song recommendations for you. Netflix, for example, uses prior data from customers to provide you with these kinds of educated guesses. It&#8217;s also how your favorite outdoor-gear retailer &#8220;knows&#8221; that you&#8217;re more likely to purchase clothing than climbing equipment, for instance, and therefore sends you targeted email when it begins a two-week sale.</p>
<p>In all cases, some system is running in the background, making recommendations for users based on accumulated data, predicting likely patterns of behavior, and adjusting offerings based on further data that the system gathers as the user browses the website in response to an email campaign.</p>
<p>Being able to set up this sort of cause-and-effect sequence of likely consumer paths is essential to intelligent business operations. But speed is also a major factor, since the faster a system can respond to these events—e.g., a click here, returning a new display there—the faster a business can act on that insight.</p>
<p>When you compare that capability to what happens on a static web page, where just the details of a bike the user clicks on get displayed, you see the opportunities that a more dynamic, data-driven process can create for the site owner.</p>
<p><em>[ How important is DX to your org? <a target="_blank" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DX00?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Take our survey</a> and find out how you stand next to the competition. Plus: <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/digital-transformation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get up to speed on digital transformation</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide. ]</em></p>
<h3>Why more data is always better</h3>
<p>Big data analytics can also show previously unrecognized patterns based not just on buying habits, but also on equipment failure rates, <a target="_blank" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/sentiment-analysis-concept-analysis-and-applications-6c94d6f58c17" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sentiment analysis</a> of massive volumes of text messages, or health indicators such as heart rate and blood pressure. The more data, the more correlations between various factors you can verify and use to predict and achieve the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Understanding consumer behavior and how to respond is one thing. Businesses can also please customers and help ensure repeat business by understanding their own operational needs and dependencies.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a simple example: Suppose you operate a pizza delivery business that supports multiple restaurants in a given area. Depending on geography, driving times based on traffic patterns vary throughout the day, from morning to midday to evening rush hour. Ideally, you can analyze where driving complexities lie during certain times of day. Google can provide basic route data, and estimate time to delivery.</p>
<p>But an accumulation of local data—based on knowledge of road construction work, current traffic conditions, and alternative routes—can allow you to get more specific. You might learn, say, that there are delivery times of plus or minus five minutes for some restaurants, and you can advise your customers accordingly.</p>
<p>You can also incorporate weather data: What&#8217;s the forecast? Those adjustments can allow more accurate delivery-time predictions. Without a big data analytics tool, you can&#8217;t predict your delivery time with much accuracy.</p>
<h3>Common modes of analytics</h3>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt">The key word in the previous paragraph is &#8220;predict.&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/3-ways-put-predictive-analytics-work-it-ops" rel="noopener noreferrer">Predictive analytics</a> is the art and science of probability-based data assessment and decision making. But it isn&#8217;t the only type of analysis that big data techniques can help with. </p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt"> </p>
<h4><strong>Descriptive analytics</strong></h4>
<p>This data set &#8220;describes&#8221; a state or condition that needs to be understood. One simple example: a printed report that shows how many trucks within a fleet of vehicles are available for deployment next Thursday. Electronic dashboards showing system throughput and computational workloads across a business&#8217;s IT environment is another; this uses data to help IT teams balance the loads properly and reduce bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Returning to the bicycle website example, when George 1) clicks on a bike image, and 2) all he gets is a set of details about that particular model, such as the average customer rating, that&#8217;s another example of descriptive analytics.</p>
<p>This sort of user experience is little more than a hierarchical display of goods for sale—a report, in a sense—with higher-level elements (bike photo, name, price) leading to lower-level elements (specifications, construction details, colors). This is certainly helpful information, but it&#8217;s not nearly the extent of what can be accomplished with data. </p>
<p>To be clear, descriptive analytics is extremely useful in some circumstances. It can help pinpoint what is wrong in a given situation so that corrective steps might be taken. When you feel sick and visit a doctor, you expect the doctor to know what to do about your condition so you&#8217;ll feel better.</p>
<p>As long as your condition can be described and it&#8217;s nothing out of the ordinary, it&#8217;s likely something that can be fairly easily diagnosed. For instance, your blood pressure can be compared against others in your age group, your doctor can show you the average (mean) statistics, and either assure you all is well or advise a new regimen to improve your numbers.</p>
<h4>Predictive analytics</h4>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/predictive-analytics-vs-ai-why-difference-matters" rel="noopener noreferrer">This type of analytics</a> is designed to predict an upcoming event, or at least understand the probability of something occurring. As such, it gives you a powerful tool for succeeding in a specific endeavor. In e-commerce, for example, the ability to predict your customers&#8217; buying habits based on known patterns is a great way to plan for your next steps.</p>
<p>If George, your prospective bike purchaser, is a returning customer, great. You know something about his buying habits, his preferences, and his decision-making process. But even if George is a new customer, the data you&#8217;ve retained from all your other customers can keep George interested and more likely to buy from you, or at least return at some later date. How does that work?</p>
<p>This requires you to build a predictive model<em>,</em> based on buckets of customer information acquired over months or years of interaction with bicycle customers. If George comes to the site and you have a collection of data that fits his demographics, what do customers like him typically buy? Can you assign a score to George based on his apparent interests and offer him something that has proved successful with other customers at his interest level?</p>
<p>If you have hundreds of customers like him, you have the basis for a model to use for displaying the accessories discussed earlier, plus other bikes, plus any number of elements from your retail bag of tricks that might keep him browsing. There are no guarantees, of course. But a user experience based on predictive analytics is clearly superior to one based on simple descriptive analytics.</p>
<h3>Use predictive models to manage the unknown </h3>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s a great thing about big data analytics: There are patterns lurking within the data that you&#8217;re likely not even aware of but that you can possibly discover and put to work. That&#8217;s where predictive analytics based on truly big data comes into play.</p>
<p>In the bike website example, the datasets amassed over time might not be huge, but they have helped you and your team understand some essential patterns that reveal buying behavior, including some patterns that describe a customer who is not interested. When you apply those same patterns to truly large datasets and use a system that can identify similar correlations between one activity and another, wholly new patterns that can lead to success may become evident.</p>
<p>Simply put, patterns are maps to behavior, human or otherwise. But why does it matter?</p>
<p>Imagine being able to sort through hundreds of thousands of details from your sales transactions to discover whether or not men in Canada between the ages of 25 and 40 tend to buy your thicker, dark socks in October. You do some correlations, and you find out—no! They tend to buy brighter colors during that month.</p>
<p>You can now run a sale and web promotion on those items—and watch your sales increase by 30%. You can add more variables, too, and test theories about buying habits based on income range or seasonal conditions. Is this going to be a harsh winter? Will that increase the probability of my sock sales or not?</p>
<h3>Removing some of the guesswork</h3>
<p>You might argue this is just an example of the educated guesswork that businesses have used for years, and you might be right. But big data analytics can take guesswork out of the picture when you encounter situations such as this.</p>

<p>At Applitools, we have tutorials showing you how to integrate Applitools with commonly-used CICD orchestration engines. You can already link Applitools with Jenkins, Travis, CircleCI. Each of these orchestration engines can automatically launch visual validation with Applitools as part of a build process.</p>
<p>What about GitHub Actions?</p>
<h2 id="h.jodcredoby3z">What is “GitHub Actions”?</h2>
<p>GitHub Actions is an API for cause and effect on GitHub: orchestrate any workflow, based on any event, while GitHub manages the execution, provides rich feedback and secures every step along the way. With GitHub Actions, workflows and steps are just code in a repository, so you can create, share, reuse, and fork your software development practices.</p>
<p>GitHub Actions makes it easier to automate how you build, test, and deploy your projects on any platform, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. This provides Fast CI/CD for any OS, any language, and any cloud!</p>
<p>Applitools provides automated Visual AI testing. It is easy to integrate Applitools with GitHub Actions, letting developers to test their code by running visual tests using GitHub Actions workflow.</p>
<p>For this article, I have chosen a Cypress automation project that has a single visual test with Applitools created before in my GitHub repo:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/satishapplitools/Cypress-Applitools-GitActions.git" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/satishapplitools/Cypress-Applitools-GitActions.git</a></p>
<h2 id="h.2byz9zbm85s6">Configuring GitHub Actions workflow on the repository</h2>
<p>Click on Actions tab in GitHub repository</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"></figure>
</div>
<p>GitHub Actions has an option to choose from several starter workflows based on programming languages, tools, technologies, and deployment options. Workflow prepares a YAML file at the end.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image16.png" alt="image16" class="wp-image-20240" width="947" height="385" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image16.png 1347w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image16-300x122.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image16-1024x417.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image16-768x313.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px"/></figure>
</div>
<p>For this article, I have chosen, “<em>Skip this and set up a workflow yourself</em>” to use an existing YAML file.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>
<p>If you want to follow along, do the same. I named my file main.yaml.  Copy the following code and paste the content into your Yaml file.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/batmi02/df7b1b1ba6cca79add3df6d6001aa73d.js</p>
</div>
<p>For Applitools integration, we require Applitools API Key and pass Git Commit SHA as Applitools Batch ID.  In the code example above, I have set up the Applitools API key as GitHub secrets and that can be passed as a call to an environment variable in the GitHub Actions workflow (as shown below).

<h2 id="h.xkvkips19gd8">Run Git Hub Actions workflow integrated with Applitools</h2>
<p>Now it’s time to run the integration.  Here are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let us create a new branch from master and name it as “feature branch”.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Make some changes in the feature branch and create a pull request to the master branch.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>GitHub Actions workflow understands there are changes made on the code, and it automatically kicks off the workflow and runs Cypress tests integrated with Applitools(as shown below)</li>
</ul>

					<description><![CDATA[Employees today are more mobile than ever. As we saw, due to COVID-19 the majority of organizations moved their employees]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>Employees today are more mobile than ever. As we saw, due to COVID-19 the majority of organizations moved their employees to a work from home model overnight. This quick change of location forced businesses to implement solutions that would provide their workforces secure remote access to an increasingly complex corporate network. Notions that used to be simpler, like Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and the cloud stack further complicate secure access policy management as employees wander from the office. </p>
<p>While working from home can increase productivity, improve employee performance and reduce costs for organizations, it comes with its challenges. Slow mobile networks and latency when connecting to corporate web applications can put a burden on remote employees, resulting in decreased productivity. However, speed and connectivity aren’t the only challenges when it comes to mobile networks.</p>
<p>As cloud adoption and BYOD are on the rise, security and IT teams must face the challenge of securing the network from outside the office. If the organization is growing network security is harder to keep up with: more devices, more unique roles to account for, and unfamiliar IP addresses connecting to the network &#8211; all requiring proper security consideration. Without a deliberate approach, malicious actors can more easily compromise the organization’s network security from different points of entry.</p>
<p>To fight off potential attacks, organizations need to rethink their network security strategy by quickly adopting authentication and testing for vulnerabilities inside the network where their applications reside. </p>
<h3>Testing Environments and Networks Comes with Security Risks </h3>
<p>Automating the testing of mobile and desktop apps through the cloud saves organizations time, money, and resources but it is also crucial to make sure that this testing environment is secured. When testing applications, employees’ networks and connections must be secured in order to add another layer of protection against hackers trying to breach the testing environment. While Sauce Labs offers its Sauce Connect Proxy, a built-in HTTP proxy server that opens a secure &#8220;tunnel&#8221; connection for testing between a Sauce Labs virtual machine or real device and a website or mobile app hosted behind a corporate firewall, it is not the only security step to consider when testing remotely. </p>
<p>If an employee doesn’t have any kind of extra layer of defense when connected to his or her network, he or she is exposed to hackers trying to infiltrate their organization’s resources. One of the most common types of attacks on a network is unauthorized access. Hackers will gain entry by accessing the network by stealing employees’ weak passwords or infiltrating previously compromised users. </p>
<p>Another common risk is access control privilege escalation. This occurs when an attacker has gained access into the network and moves horizontally inside the network infrastructure and servers. This threat allows hackers to gain access to more resources and data with the original privileged access credentials they have stolen. </p>
<p>To avoid these types of attacks, organizations need to implement more concrete user restrictions with a privileged access model. This will allow them to limit who has access to their network and applications, and what they can access. By restricting access to a certain amount of users, you will decrease the number of authorized access risks to your network. With stricter network access rules in place, you will have a more secure testing environment as well. </p>
<h3>Security Solution for a More Secure Network</h3>
<p>Knowing about network risks is only half the battle. When discovering a risk to your organization, you need to clearly strategize how to address it and be proactive so it doesn’t happen again. One of the most effective ways for organizations to ensure a secure network for testing their applications is by implementing security solutions that have strong access policy controls. </p>
<p>A key benefit that comes with implementing a network security solution is the increased ability to find and fix network vulnerabilities and monitor network activity. With the help of security solutions sitting at the edge of your corporate network, you can quickly identify an attack and fix the exploitable endpoint which would otherwise have been an entry point for a successful attack. </p>
<p>Network security solutions offer a group of tools, policies, and data to help create a stronger comprehensive security strategy. The key motive when adopting security solutions is to increase the organization’s security from incoming attacks, meaning to make a successful attack an expensive and difficult prospect for any would-be hacker. </p>
<p>Alongside these security solutions, the organization will need to adopt accompanying company-wide policies that mitigate any insider risks the organization will face. Some organizations might not have the resources to implement an internal security strategy and in these cases a third party security solution will provide them with the right amount of security to fight off incoming attacks.  </p>
<h3>Moving Forward </h3>
<p>In today’s digital world, the biggest concern for organizations is data security. Attacks on organizations’ networks are happening more often and with a bigger impact, requiring companies to implement strong cybersecurity strategies in order to ensure  their network isn’t similarly vulnerable against unauthorized access. When testing your mobile and web application in a testing environment, make sure you have secure access to your corporate network. This is all it takes to test more applications without worrying about the security of your network. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[This year&#8217;s Amazon Prime Day may be delayed (reportedly until August or September), but when it does arrive, it is]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>This year&#8217;s Amazon Prime Day may be delayed (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21266249/amazon-prime-day-2020-delayed-september-coronavirus-pandemic-shipping" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reportedly until August or September</a>), but when it does arrive, it is certain to bring with it the usual flood of web traffic from hungry shoppers looking for killer deals.</p>
<p>Now one of the biggest annual shopping bonanzas on the web—for Amazon, it&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://blogs.akamai.com/2019/07/amazon-prime-day-is-now-a-major-holiday-driving-up-traffic-by-more-than-14-in-the-us.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">bigger than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined</a>—Prime Day doesn&#8217;t just bring visitors flocking to Amazon. It also delivers an onslaught of traffic to other retailers, which wisely piggyback on Amazon with their own promotional activities. Last year, <a target="_blank" href="https://chainstoreage.com/technology/prime-day-not-just-for-amazon-250-retailers-to-offer-deals" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">more than 250 retailers</a> joined in, with their average revenue <a target="_blank" href="https://chainstoreage.com/technology/other-retailers-score-big-on-prime-day-but-some-department-stores-left-in-the-cold" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">jumping a whopping 68%</a> over the two days of the sale.</p>
<p>The bad news is that massive traffic spikes such as this <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/was-amazon-prime-day-intended-performance-test-production" rel="noopener noreferrer">can wreak havoc on your network</a> if you&#8217;re unprepared. The good news is that events such as Cyber Monday and Amazon Prime Day are announced well in advance, so <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/performance-reality-check-how-keep-unexpected-surges" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can plan for them accordingly</a>.</p>
<p>With Prime Day likely a couple of months away, you have plenty of time to get your network in order so the business can plan for the surge of visitors from a place of relative comfort. Here&#8217;s how.</p>
<p><em>[ Learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/enterprise-service-management-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to optimize your Enterprise Service Management</a> in TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide.

<h3>Cache is king</h3>
<p>Stephan Roussan, president of ICVM Group, a web development and hosting agency, , said his company&#8217;s client base included high-profile corporate clients who experience high-visibility events and have a very low tolerance for downtime. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Whenever we are preparing for an exponential traffic or load event, we start with a basic assessment.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/sroussan" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stephan Roussan</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That assessment asks a series of questions that are instructive to any enterprise preparing for a traffic surge, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the baseline health of the environment, and how much ceiling is currently available in terms of available resources?</li>
<li>Can you calculate the potential peak load and anticipate when it might occur? Will there be more than one peak? How long will the peaks last?</li>
<li>If the environment is already load-balanced, how often is it rolling over to secondary and tertiary instances? Is there a chance it will exhaust all resources?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to these questions help set a base understanding for capacity planning for the surge event.</p>
<p>As another safety measure, Roussan said, his firm will look to reschedule any processes that would normally be running during the event—such as backups and index builds. This will help minimize resource consumption during the spike. Disallowing spider and bot traffic during this time is another smart idea.</p>
<p>As a final tactic, Roussan said, he can&#8217;t overemphasize the importance of a smart caching regimen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Lengthen your cache life for the anticipated spike window. You can always dial it back afterwards.&#8221;<br />—Stephan Roussan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just make sure to be in close contact with your content publishing teams so that everyone is on the same page with regard to cache-flush protocol and any lag time relating to making content updates visible publicly, he advised.</p>
<h3>Test extensively and often</h3>
<p>The counterpart to planning is testing, and plenty of it. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/spoons/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Daniel Spoonhower</a>, CTO of performance management software developer Lightstep, said that part of being ready means testing—both software systems and your staff&#8217;s readiness. </p>
<p>Spoonhower recommends starting with a standard barrage of load testing. Use synthetic but realistic application loads to understand what services will fail first and what their breaking points are. He also suggests <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34603680/what-is-squeeze-testing" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">taking advantage of squeeze testing</a>—a newer tactic popularized by Netflix to determine the threshold at which a service &#8220;breaks&#8221; by gradually applying additional traffic in incremental steps.</p>
<p>And remember that testing also means testing your staff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Game-day testing provides a safe way for your staff to practice responding to events and ensure that they have the documentation, training, and processes necessary to respond quickly and confidently.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/spoons/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Daniel Spoonhower</a></p>

<h3>Prepare for the worst</h3>
<p>Despite all the planning and testing, even the most robust of systems are going to fail sometime. Last year, both Costco and Nordstrom experienced online <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/costco-nordstrom-rack-sites-crash-with-black-friday-sales-2019-11" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">outages during Black Friday</a>, sending thousands of potential shoppers to the competition. The solution to this is to have a strong contingency plan in place that ensures you can get back up and running quickly should a system fail.</p>
<p>When experiencing a dramatic change in input such as e-commerce platforms often see on major shopping holidays, the main risk is that a set of unforeseen errors can quickly cascade across the environment, leading to systemic failure, said <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/talws/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tal Weiss</a>, CTO of OverOps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;At that point, what began as a local surge of errors in one or more services or components can rapidly begin to generate errors in downstream or dependent services.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/talws/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tal Weiss</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The challenge in responding to a failure event such as this, Weiss said, is to determine which of the errors that you&#8217;re experiencing are new. In a scenario where literally millions of alerts could be flooding the system at once, only a handful may be relevant to finding a solution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Your team will need to have a process in place to proactively establish a baseline ahead of the surge, as well as the right set of tools to fingerprint and map errors to their code location and alert based on deviations.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Consider outsourcing the problem</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-apm-tools-can-help-predict-prepare-traffic-spikes" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planning for a traffic surge</a> is an incredibly complex endeavor, and if your organization doesn&#8217;t have the necessary skills and tools, you can quickly find yourself in over your head.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emazingbrian/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Brian Lim</a> is CEO of EmazingGroup, which sells club and festival outfits and accessories. He <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/132783196" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">appeared on <i>Shark Tank</i> in 2015</a> to pitch EmazingLights, lighted gloves designed for the rave scene. Well aware of the date and time when the show would air, Lim knew in advance when traffic would hit the company&#8217;s website almost down to the minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew that being featured on a highly viewed television show would attract quite a bit of website traffic,&#8221; said Lim. In the six months leading up to the episode&#8217;s air date, the company purchased 30 servers, simulated load tests, and invested over $500,000 to make sure the site could handle the massive influx of traffic that would be coming their way.</p>
<p>But when the episode aired, the site went down anyway, he said.</p>
<p>Lim said he considers the company&#8217;s choice of platforms, originally built on a Magento backbone, a &#8220;near fatal&#8221; error.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;A lot of money was lost that day, and it made what should have been one of the happiest days one of the worst.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emazingbrian/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Brian Lim</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To solve the problem, EmazingGroup surrendered, dropping its DIY e-commerce ambitions and moving everything to a hosted site on Shopify.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Our lives have been made immeasurably easier, and we likely would never have had this issue if we had been with Shopify from the beginning. But we didn&#8217;t let that situation sink our company. The experience was a great reminder to focus on our products and marketing above all other business functions as an e-commerce brand.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Learn from the big fish</h3>
<p>What can you learn from such mega-traffic events and the planning that goes into them? Follow their lead and adapt at an appropriate level for your online services, and you will be one step ahead. After all, customers consider performance to be a primary reflection on your brand.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In a previous blog post, you have seen how to get started with the brand new TestProject Python SDK and]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a previous <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/getting-started-with-testproject-python-sdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, you have seen how to get started with the brand new <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a> Python SDK and add the power of the TestProject platform to your existing Selenium-based tests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/testproject-python-sdk/0.63.13/" rel="noopener noreferrer">version 0.63.13</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Python SDK can also be used with your Appium-based tests. In this blog post, you’ll see exactly how to do that.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f40d.png" alt="🐍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Register for <a target="_blank" href="https://tricentis.zoom.us/webinar/register/6515948566289/WN_ro4hpAZ4SdaNBmUSPeje5A" rel="noopener noreferrer">this free webinar</a> I’m hosting all about the new Python SDK, Tuesday, July 28th </strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f40d.png" alt="🐍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SDK supports both mobile web and native app tests, for Android as well as for iOS. We’re going to take a look at two examples:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mobile web test on Android and Chrome, using an emulator</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A native iOS app test, using a real device</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Running mobile web tests on Android using an emulator</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m going to assume that you have already downloaded the Python SDK, have configured your Agent and developer token, and that your Agent is running. If not, you can read how to do that in this <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/getting-started-with-testproject-python-sdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>. Also, I’m going to assume that you already have created and started an emulator running Android.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take this test as an example:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="python">import pytest

from appium import webdriver
from tests.pageobjects.web import LoginPage, ProfilePage


@pytest.fixture
def driver():

    desired_capabilities = {
        "udid": "emulator-5554",
        "browserName": "chrome",
        "platformName": "Android",
    }

    driver = webdriver.Remote(desired_capabilities=desired_capabilities)
    yield driver
    driver.quit()


def test_example_on_chrome_on_android(driver):

    LoginPage(driver).open().login_as("John Smith", "12345")

    profile_page = ProfilePage(driver)
    profile_page.update_profile(
        "United States",
        "Street name and number",
        "<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c5afaaadabebb6a8acb1ad85b6aaa8a0b2ada0b7a0ebb1a9a1" rel="noopener noreferrer">[email protected]</a>",
        "+1 555 555 55",
    )
    assert profile_page.saved_message_is_displayed() is True
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see from the defined </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">desired_capabilities</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this test runs on an emulator with name </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">emulator-5554</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;">,  which runs Android. Specifying a browser name, i.e., </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">chrome</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;">, indicates that we’re running a mobile web test.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To turn this Appium test into a TestProject-powered test, similar to <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/getting-started-with-testproject-python-sdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium-based tests</a>, all you need to do is change this import statement:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">from appium import webdriver
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">from src.testproject.sdk.drivers import webdriver
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and you’re good to go. Plus: you don’t need to run your own Appium server anymore, as the TestProject Agent acts as an Appium server for you!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you run this test, it will start a Chrome browser on your Android emulator and run the test:</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><noscript><img class="alignnone wp-image-13353 size-full" title="TestProject Python SDK - Chrome browser on your Android emulator" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_1.png" alt="TestProject Python SDK - Chrome browser on your Android emulator" width="480" height="861" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_1.png 480w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_1-285x512.png 285w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"/></noscript></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the test has finished executing, the SDK sends reports to the Agent, which will, in turn, create a new test report on the TestProject platform:</span></p>

<h2><strong>Running native app tests on iOS using a real device</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you’ve read earlier, the TestProject Python SDK supports both Android and iOS. Let’s take a look at an example test that tests a native iOS app running on a real iPhone:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">import pytest

from src.testproject.sdk.drivers import webdriver
from tests.pageobjects.android import LoginPage, ProfilePage


@pytest.fixture
def driver():

    desired_capabilities = {
        "udid": "&lt;my_device_udid_here&gt;",
        "deviceName": "iPhone van Bas",
        "browserName": "",
        "platformName": "iOS",
        "bundleId": "io.testproject.Demo",
    }

    driver = webdriver.Remote(desired_capabilities=desired_capabilities)

    yield driver

    driver.close_app()
    driver.quit()


def test_example_on_native_ios_app(driver):

    LoginPage(driver).login_as("John Smith", "12345")

    profile_page = ProfilePage(driver)

    profile_page.update_profile(
        "United States",
        "Street name and number",
        "<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9df7f2f5f3b3eef0f4e9f5ddeef2f0f8eaf5f8eff8b3e9f1f9" rel="noopener noreferrer">[email protected]</a>",
        "+1 555 555 55",
    )

    assert profile_page.saved_message_is_displayed() is True
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no browser specified in the </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">desired_capabilities</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which means that this test is running against a native app. Here’s a screenshot from the actual iOS device used, taken during test execution:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13363 size-medium" title="Appium Tests with Python SDK for iOS" alt="Appium Tests with Python SDK for iOS" width="512" height="287" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_3-1-1-512x287.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_3-1-1-768x431.png 768w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_3-1-1-1024x575.png 1024w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_3-1-1.png 1197w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_3-1-1-512x287.png"/></p>

TestProject enables you to run tests on <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/01/29/setup-ios-test-automation-windows-without-mac/" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS devices without the need for running macOS or XCode</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and without having to run an Appium server yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This test, too, passes, as we can see in the reports that are sent to TestProject:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13356 size-full" title="TestProject Reports" alt="TestProject Reports" width="1567" height="526" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_4.png 1567w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_4-512x172.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_4-768x258.png 768w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_4-1024x344.png 1024w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1567px) 100vw, 1567px" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_4.png"/></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, using the TestProject Python SDK (or the  <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/java-sdk" rel="noopener noreferrer">Java</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/c-sdk" rel="noopener noreferrer">C#</a> SDK), you can easily transform your existing Appium-based tests to TestProject-powered tests, no matter if they are for Android or iOS, using an emulator or a real device, testing mobile web or a native app, on macOS, Linux and Windows.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[After determining your project scope and requirements, use this guide to create a request for proposal (RFP) to send to]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>After determining your project scope and requirements, use this guide to create a request for proposal (RFP) to send to the vendors on your list.</p>
<p>Here we&#8217;ve compiled a list of questions that you might want to include in your RFP. Use this list as a guide and trim away the pieces you don&#8217;t need. Try to limit your product-related questions to those that are critical to your organization and keep it short, but complete. </p>
<p>The reason: When you send lengthy lists of product requirements to vendors, you&#8217;ll get back lengthy responses that are virtually impossible to compare. Focus on your top 10 requirements, and you will find it much easier to contrast vendors and make an informed decision.</p>
<p>When evaluating the vendor responses, consider assigning weightings to the requirements to ensure that your most important requirements are ranked highest as you score the candidates.</p>

<h3>Introduce yourself—provide a statement of your current status</h3>
<h4>Statement of goals, concerns, and objectives</h4>
<ul>
<li>Describe your service management automation goals, the problems you are trying to solve, and any relevant metrics you are hoping to improve.</li>
<li>State the greatest concerns for company management relative to service management, customer satisfaction, digital transformation, and business efficiency, and explain how you expect this tool to contribute.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Describe your interoperability requirements in detail</h4>
<ul>
<li>List the tools you have, and note your preference for a tool with the specific APIs you need for things like configuration, infrastructure, and monitoring. Ask vendors to comment about interoperability in those three areas.</li>
<li>Ask how much effort it will take to integrate their product with your toolset using their APIs/openAPI.</li>
<li>Provide an inventory of the kind of data (often bi-directional) you need to support, and ask them to explain in detail what their product can do in those areas.</li>
<li>Ask how their tools interoperate with cloud-native apps.</li>
<li>Ask how their tools capture information from the cloud.</li>
<li>Ask how easy it is to switch between cloud-based and on-premises services.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Request specific details about ease of use</h4>
<p>Today&#8217;s ESM buyers are looking for products that are less complicated to implement, upgrade, license, and maintain, particularly in light of the many integrations needed to make enterprise services flow properly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask how much effort is required to implement and maintain their product.</li>
<li>Ask how much effort is needed to upgrade to a new version, including all of the integrations that have been implemented.</li>
<li>Ask them to describe their approach to licensing and license management.</li>
<li>If you are having problems with the products you already own, describe how they are falling short—how they create too much work for your team or what capabilities they lack—and explain what you expect a new solution to provide.</li>
<li>Be transparent about what you don&#8217;t have and why you think it will help you to have it. Vendors and service providers can be valuable partners, so be frank about the issues you face with your current tools. They may surprise you with fresh ideas and strategies.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Statement of resources</h4>
<ul>
<li>Explain the job titles and skillsets of the people who will use the tool.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Infrastructure requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>List the main elements of your environment that are relevant to the tool usage:</li>
<li>Operating systems</li>
<li>Hardware</li>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>DevOps frameworks/pipeline</li>
<li>Cloud strategy</li>
</ul>
<h3>Vendor information</h3>
<p>Here are sample questions to ask the vendors. Our list covers a lot of ground, but you probably won&#8217;t need to ask all of them in your RFP. If you don’t have a mainframe, for example, there’s no need to ask about that. Trim this list as required to meet your needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your company, history, and ITSM/ESM focus?</li>
<li>Who is the primary contact for sales? Who is the primary contact for technical questions?</li>
<li>Do you have reference customers that can be contacted?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Products and capabilities</h4>
<p>This section helps you understand the product, the vendor&#8217;s approach to service management, and any innovations the vendor offers.</p>
<ul>
<li>List your product or products and the primary category of each.</li>
<li>List the scope of operations the tool was designed for.</li>
<li>What kinds of skills are required to use this tool?</li>
<li>What browsers do you support?</li>
<li>What devices do you support?</li>
<li>What platforms do you support?</li>
<li>Can your product handle services that are provided by mainframe apps?</li>
<li>Which continuous integration/continuous delivery tools do you support?</li>
<li>How easy is it to integrate your product with the other tools I currently use?</li>
<li>How easy is it to extend your product?</li>
<li>What types of reporting and analytics capabilities does the product provide? Is integration with a third-party reporting tool required for minimum reporting?</li>
<li>What are the features or innovations that differentiate you from your competitors?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Deployment, updates, and support</h4>
<ul>
<li>Is your product or service offered on-premises, as a cloud service, or as a hybrid solution?</li>
<li>Does deployment require a consulting engagement?</li>
<li>Do you offer guided consulting to assist during implementation?</li>
<li>How often do you release new versions or update the software?</li>
<li>Do you offer support? What are the terms of your support contracts?</li>
<li>What training options do you offer?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>There has never been a better time to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/8-steps-get-started-enterprise-service-management" rel="noopener noreferrer">get started with ESM</a>, or to expand your ESM footprint. The vendor market has solidified, the benefits are increasingly obvious, and the tools are getting easier to use. Most importantly, some of your competitors are probably already using ESM in some areas and will continue to exploit that competitive edge over you until you enter the game.</p>
<p>Done right, ESM can become the platform for your organization’s back-office digital transformation. Back-office operations are often overlooked in the drive to achieve digital transformation. But when companies fail to address the operational side, they haven’t really transformed the business.</p>
<p>As a 2019 World Economic Forum paper said: &#8220;Customer engagement is essential, great product and services are mandatory, and an innovative economic model may be table stakes, but without operations all of that fails.&#8221; In some cases, &#8220;Back-office actually becomes front-office, as non-IT departments expose their services to their employees and customers, which in turn, requires them to become service-centric organizations,&#8221; said Pott.</p>
<p>Get started today. Using the information and guidance in this document, assemble a team with the right players, step with them through the fundamental considerations, and get a viable ESM project underway. With the right sponsor, team, and ESM technologies in place, you&#8217;ll embark on a journey of continuous improvement that will keep your organization competitive and add value to the entire business for many years to come.</p>
<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>Try to limit your product-related questions to those that are critical to your organization and keep it short. When you send lengthy lists of product requirements to vendors, you&#8217;ll get back lengthy responses that are virtually impossible to compare.</li>
<li>In the RFP, include your goals, concerns, and objectives.</li>
<li>Spell out your interoperability requirements in detail; include your current tools and an inventory of the data you need to support.</li>
<li>Get information about maintenance and support, as well as license requirements.</li>
<li>Find out about the vendor; ask about company history, primary sales/support contacts, and customer references.</li>
<li>Get details about the product&#8217;s features, functions, scope, platforms supported, and how easy or difficult it would be to extend or customize.</li>
<li>Get going! Done correctly, ESM can become the platform for your organization&#8217;s back-office digital transformation.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Create Strong Passwords with a Password Generator Whether you use the internet for several hours every day or only browse]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>

<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<h2><strong>Create Strong Passwords with a Password Generator</strong></h2>
<p>Whether you use the internet for several hours every day or only browse it on occasion, you have likely created numerous accounts on streaming services, financial services, and online storefronts like Amazon. Many of these accounts contain highly sensitive information. Hackers can get into online accounts and computers by guessing passwords, which means that your personal information would be available to them if you use a weak password.</p>
<p>To effectively protect your accounts from being hacked, it’s important that you have a strong password with each account that you create. However, it can be difficult to think of the perfect password that will keep your account safe from any hacker. To that end, there are many ways to create strong passwords, the primary of which is through a password generator. This article goes into detail about the importance of using good passwords and how to create them.</p>
<h3><strong>Importance of Having a Strong Password</strong></h3>
<p>Whenever you purchase an item online, you will be required to enter some financial information, which can include your bank account or credit card number. Many individuals may make the mistake of saving their financial information to the account because of how convenient it is. When you need to purchase an item in the future, you won’t need to go through the hassle of reentering your credit card information. The problem with saving your financial info to your account is that hackers who get into your account will have automatic access to the information at hand.</p>
<h3><strong>Website Security Measures Also Benefit from Strong Passwords</strong></h3>
<p>While website security has become increasingly strong over the past decade or so, the security measures that a site owner takes don’t matter if a hacker is able to get into your account by guessing your password, which is why it’s essential that you create a strong password that will hold up to hacking attempts.</p>
<h3><strong>Weak Passwords can Lead to Many Problems</strong></h3>
<p>Without a strong password, you run the risk of experiencing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">identity theft</a> or financial fraud, both of which can significantly damage your finances and livelihood if the issue isn’t corrected immediately. Keep in mind that some of the more popular passwords in the country include 123456, password, 111111, qwerty, and abc123. Because of how popular these passwords are, they are some of the first that hackers will use to attempt to get into an account.</p>
<h3><strong>Hackers Can Control Your Entire Account</strong></h3>
<p>Once a hacker has breached your account, they can do a variety of things. The primary of which involves aquiring financial information that can be found in your account. These individuals can also choose to make purchases with this account or send in requests for new credit cards under your name. Along with stealing your own money, it’s possible for hackers to ruin your credit, which could take years to remedy.</p>
<h3><strong>Hackers Could Breach Your Computer</strong></h3>
<p>It’s important to understand that hackers can also get into your computer. Though more difficult, hackers can access documents and personal information on your computer if they are able to guess the password to your operating system. Many people store the passwords that they use in a document that’s stored on their computer, which is done with the belief that a hacker will never get into the computer itself. In the event that a hacker gains access to your device, they would be able to read the document where your passwords are stored. While having a strong password doesn’t eliminate the possibility of being hacked, it will make it much more difficult for someone to gain access to your computer or online accounts.</p>
<h3><strong>Using a Password Generator</strong></h3>
<p>If you need to store important personal or financial information online or on your computer, it’s essential that you pair your devices and accounts with strong passwords that will hold up to hacking attempts. Even though you can create lengthy and strong passwords without any assistance, keep in mind that the average U.S. citizen has around 25-30 accounts that passwords are needed for. Attempting to identify the perfect password on your own and for each account that you create can be a time-consuming and laborious process. Password generators are designed to instantly provide you with passwords that should be very difficult to guess.</p>
<h3><strong>How Password Generators Work</strong></h3>
<p>While every password generator is somewhat unique, the best generators are ones that provide you with options on what you would like to include in the password. The majority of password generators will automatically create passwords that are at least 15 characters long, consist of symbols and numbers, and include uppercase and lowercase letters. However, certain generators also provide users with the ability to exclude similar and ambiguous characters from the password that’s generated. Once you have generated a password, all that’s left is for you to input it into the account you’re currently creating. Password generators are simple to use and can make your life easier as you attempt to keep your personal information safe and secure.</p>
<h3><strong>Extra Features to Look For in Password Generator</strong></h3>
<p>Password generators can come with many extra features that could prove helpful in keeping your accounts and computer secure. For instance, some services provide users with a master password, which means that all of your passwords and secure information are kept under a single password that only you know. Some tools also allow users to set the exact length of the password, which could consist of anywhere from 8-100 characters. Additional features to be on the lookout for include unlimited password storage, 24/7 support, and custom security controls.</p>
<h3><strong>McAfee True Key Features</strong></h3>
<p>One potential password manager and generator you can use is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.truekey.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee True Key</a>, which is designed to create very lengthy and strong passwords. Some of the core features of this particular tool include local data encryption, the support of numerous browsers, syncing across PC, Mac, iOS, and Android devices, and many different methods for signing in. For instance, you could pair the True Key app with the fingerprint reader on your device. You can also use the app to import any stored passwords from your browser.</p>
<h3><strong>How to Create a Strong Password</strong></h3>
<p>There are a myriad of things that you can do to create a strong password, the easiest of which is to use a password generator that will automatically provide you with a randomized password that will hold up well to hackers. While using a password generator is the most convenient option for creating a strong password, there are some additional tips and guidelines that you should keep in mind.</p>
<h3><strong>Primary Guidelines for Creating a Great Password</strong></h3>
<p>The main guidelines to keep in mind when creating a strong password include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your password is at least 7-8 characters long</li>
<li>Make sure that you never use a word or symbol for your password that can easily be found on any of your social media pages</li>
<li>Change each password you use at an interval or 90 days or less, which should also be done for any strong passwords you use</li>
<li>Use a combination of numbers, special characters, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters</li>
<li>Don’t use the same password for numerous accounts, which heightens the possibility that a breach into one of your accounts could lead to several accounts being compromised</li>
<li>Never write down your password on a piece of paper, which only serves to heighten the possibility of the password being seen by another individual and copied down</li>
<li>Consider using numbers and letters for your password that have no identifiable patterns within</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Stay protected</strong></h3>
<p>Passwords are essential for security and can help you keep your computer and online accounts safe from hackers. While financial fraud and cases of stolen identity may be able to be corrected without any lasting damage to your bank account or credit score, the hassle that comes with contacting banking institutions and fixing any issues pertaining to the hack is more than it’s worth. Even though the aforementioned tips should assist you in creating a strong password, it’s highly recommended that you use a password generator instead, which ensures that mistakes are avoided completely and that the passwords you use are secure.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Sauce Labs announced the release of our newest product to expand developer-first capabilities: Sauce Testrunner Toolkit. Currently]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>Earlier this year, Sauce Labs <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/blog/look-no-strings-puppeteer-jest-and-sauce-labs" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced the release</a> of our newest product to expand developer-first capabilities: <a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.saucelabs.com/testrunner-toolkit/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sauce Testrunner Toolkit</a>. Currently in a free beta, it makes setting up, writing, and running web tests easier and faster for developers during early pipeline testing. This is the first in a number of updates to our platform that empower developers with the tools they need to achieve quality at scale.</p>
<p>But to realize that goal, we understand that we must meet developers where they are from a tooling perspective. This is why we also revealed support for Puppeteer in the same announcement, and soon after added Playwright. Today our team is thrilled to announce that we have expanded support for two more “developer-focused” testing frameworks: Cypress and TestCafe!</p>
<h3>Introducing Cypress and TestCafe</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Cypress and TestCafe are open source testing frameworks for development teams. They contain tools that make it easy for developers to set up, write, run and debug tests. The Sauce Labs Testrunner Toolkit will create a containerized environment, so you can easily use these frameworks for quick test setup and execution without having to rely on any servers or drivers, and you never have to leave the terminal to achieve it!</p>
<p>For developers, using these frameworks really allows them to realize the benefits of early pipeline testing as quality shifts left, and take more ownership of the quality of the code they create. Using these frameworks in conjunction with Testrunner Toolkit provide even more value, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Accelerate release velocity</b> &#8211; Sauce Testrunner Toolkit allows for developers to execute tests on a preconfigured Docker container in Chrome and Firefox from their local machine. This allows for decreased testing times, instant feedback, and more productive developers, which in turn accelerates release speeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>CI Integrations</b> &#8211; with integrations via GitLab, GitHub, Travis or CircleCI, developers can also run tests in Testrunner Toolkit as part of their CI/CD pipeline. This allows them to plug tests into already-existing infrastructure, and avoids unnecessary load on their side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Debugging and Insights</b> &#8211; with access to the Sauce Labs platform, developers have the ability to pinpoint the reason for test failures with our suite of debugging tools (including video recordings, logs, and more). Combined with our Insights platform, which includes actionable data and recommendations to improve test efficiency, Sauce Labs provides a complete solution to help understand the quality of applications earlier in the software development lifecycle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>Testrunner Toolkit is easy to install, and is completely free! Here is a quick, 3-step setup guide straight from our <a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.saucelabs.com/testrunner-toolkit/" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>
<h4><b>Requirements</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker</a> installed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure the Docker daemon is running (e.g. docker info works in your terminal)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sauce Labs</a> account; if you don&#8217;t have one, start a <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/sign-up" rel="noopener noreferrer">free trial</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><b> Installing Testrunner Toolkit</b></h4>
<p>Using NPM:</p>
<pre><code>npm i -g saucectl</code></pre>
<p>You can also utilize our one line installer:</p>
<pre><code>curl -L https://saucelabs.github.io/saucectl/install | bash</code></pre>
<p>Would you like to inspect the content of our one line installer? Download it, have a look and execute it:</p>
<pre><code>curl -fsSL -o get_saucectl.sh  https://saucelabs.github.io/saucectl/install
chmod 700 get_saucectl.sh
./get_saucectl.sh</code></pre>
<h4><b>Connecting to Sauce Labs</b></h4>
<p>A Sauce Labs user name and access key are needed to post the test results. You can get your SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY from Account &gt; User Settings in <a target="_blank" href="https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sauce Labs</a>.</p>
<p>To authenticate yourself, the following environment variables need to be set:</p>
<pre><code>SAUCE_USERNAME</code></pre>
<pre><code>SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY</code></pre>
<p>You can export them as follows:</p>
<pre><code>export SAUCE_USERNAME=&lt;your-username&gt;</code></pre>
<pre><code>export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=&lt;your-access-key&gt;</code></pre>
<p>If you are using a cloud CI/CD tool, we strongly suggest protecting these values through secrets or context variables.</p>
<p>After setup, you can use the new <code>saucectl</code> run command to run your tests in any of the supported frameworks, and then view the results in your Sauce Labs accounts. Here is a brief demo of how that works (using Cypress):</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/1QA3Tvr6dg7YyFv9zu2kyX/1487d89686b77afc3c7b5716c1e20d35/cypress-poc-demo.gif" alt="Cypress demo" title="Cypress demo"/></p>
<p>To learn more about this, and how to run your first test, please reference the documentation on our <a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.saucelabs.com/testrunner-toolkit/" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repo</a>, or take a look at this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfSOejlKD0&amp;list=PL67l1VPxOnT4chA1dFFjTCEeAmRnfo_8V&amp;index=6" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo presentation</a> from SauceCon 2020.</p>
<h3>What’s Next</h3>
<p>Today, developers using Sauce Labs Testrunner Toolkit can run tests on a local machine or through their CI/CD pipeline, as well as view results in the Sauce Labs UI. This means tests can be executed in only the Chrome and Firefox versions shipped with the pre-configured container provided by Sauce. In our next iteration, you will be able to configure tests from Testrunner Toolkit to execute in our virtual desktop cloud environment. This will give you access to hundreds of browser and OS combinations, as well as the ability to scale your efforts by running tests in parallel. This comprehensive coverage, along with the scalability to accelerate code velocity, will help developers truly embrace quality without sacrificing speed.</p>
<h3>Try It For Yourself! </h3>
<p>Cypress and TestCafe are now both supported as a part of the Sauce Testrunner Toolkit beta, which is completely free! If you’d like to try it out for yourself, head over to our <a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.saucelabs.com/testrunner-toolkit/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github repo</a> where you can get started right away.</p>
