										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />

<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<h2><strong>1. Attackers have a plan, with clear objectives and outcomes in mind. Do you have one?</strong></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Clearly this was a motivated and patient adversary. They spent many months in the planning and execution of an attack that was not incredibly sophisticated in its tactics, but rather used multiple semi-novel attack methods combined with persistent, stealthy and well-orchestrated processes. In a world where we always need to find ways to stay even one step ahead of adversaries, how well is your SOC prepared to bring the same level of consistent, methodical and well-orchestrated visibility and response when such an adversary comes knocking at your door?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Plan, test and continuously improve your SecOps processes with effective purple-teaming exercises. Try to think like a stealthy attacker and predict what sources of telemetry will be necessary to detect suspicious usage of legitimate applications and trusted software solutions.</span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Modern attacks abuse trust, not necessarily vulnerabilities. Be</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">threat focused</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">. Do threat modeling and identify where the risks are. Leverage BCP data and think of your identity providers (AD Domain Controllers, Azure AD, etc.) as ‘crown jewels’.</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Assume that your most critical assets are under attack, especially those that leverage third-party applications where elevated privileges are a requirement for their effective operation. Granting service accounts unrestricted administrative privileges sounds like a bad idea – because it is. Least-privilege access, </span><span data-contrast="auto">micro segmentation</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and ingress/egress traffic filtering should be implemented in support of a Zero-Trust program for those assets specifically that allow outside access by a ‘trusted’ 3rd-party.</span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. IOCs are becoming less useful as attackers don’t reuse them, sometimes even inside the same victim. Focus on TTPs &amp; behaviors.</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The threat research world has moved beyond atomic indicators, file hashes and watchlists of malicious IPs and domains upon which most threat intelligence providers still rely. Think beyond Indicators of Compromise. </span><span data-contrast="auto">We should rely less on</span><span data-contrast="auto"> static lists of artifacts but </span><span data-contrast="auto">instead</span><span data-contrast="auto"> focused on heuristics and behavioral indicators. Event-only analysis can easily identify the low-hanging fruit of commodity attack patterns, but more sophisticated adversaries are going to make it more difficult. Ephemeral C2 servers and single-use DNS entries per asset (not target enterprise) were some of the more well-planned (yet relatively simple) behaviors seen in the Sunburst attack. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Monitor</span><span data-contrast="auto"> carefully for changes in asset configuration like logging output/location or even the absence of new audit messages in a given polling period. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">4</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">. Beware of the perfect attack fallacy. Attackers can’t innovate across the entire attack chain. Identify places where you have more chances to detect their presence (i.e. privilege escalation, persistency, discovery, defense evasion, etc.)</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">All telemetry is NOT created equal. Behavioral analysis of authentication events in support of UEBA detections can be incredibly effective, but that assumes identity data is available in the event stream. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Based on my experience, </span><span data-contrast="auto">SIEM data typically yields only 15-20% of events that include useful identity data, whereas almost 85% of cloud access events contain this rich contextual data, a byproduct of growing IAM adoption and SSO practices. Events generated from critical assets (crown jewels) are of obvious interest to SecOps analysts for both detection and investigation, but don’t lose sight of those assets on the periphery; perhaps an RDP </span><span data-contrast="auto">jump box</span><span data-contrast="auto"> sitting in the DMZ that also synchronizes trust with enterprise AD servers either on-premises or in the cloud. Find ways to isolate assets with elevated privilege or those running ‘trusted’ third-party applications using </span><span data-contrast="auto">micro segmentation</span><span data-contrast="auto"> where behavioral analysis can more easily be performed. Leverage volumetric analysis of network traffic to identify potentially abnormal patterns; monitor inbound and outbound requests (DNS, HTTP, FTP, </span><span data-contrast="auto">etc</span><span data-contrast="auto">) to detect when a new session has been made to/from an unknown source/destination – or where the registration age of the target domain seems suspiciously new. Learn what ‘normal’ looks like from these assets by baselining and fingerprinting, so that unusual activity can be blocked or at the very least escalated to an analyst for review.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">5</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">. Architect your defenses for visibility, detection &amp; response to augment protection capabilities. Leverage EDR, XDR &amp; SIEM for historical and real-time threat hunting.</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The only way to gain insight into the attacker behaviors – and any chance of detecting and disrupting attacks of this style – require extensive telemetry from a wide array of sensors. Endpoint sensor grids provide high-fidelity telemetry about all things on-</span><span data-contrast="auto">device but</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">are rarely deployed </span><span data-contrast="auto">on server assets</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and tend to be </span><span data-contrast="auto">‘</span><span data-contrast="auto">network-blind</span><span data-contrast="auto">’</span><span data-contrast="auto">. SIEMs have traditionally been leveraged to consume and correlate data from all 3rd-party data sources, but it likely does not have the ability (or scale) to consume all EDR/endpoint events, leaving them largely </span><span data-contrast="auto">‘</span><span data-contrast="auto">endpoint-blind</span><span data-contrast="auto">’</span><span data-contrast="auto">.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>To achieve the high-velocity goals of digital transformation, you need to improve your organization&#8217;s ability to consistently deliver customer value through shared processes.</p>
<p>Organizations that want to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/6-takeaways-how-forecast-value-devops-transformations" rel="noopener">accelerate value delivery</a> and improve collaboration, people, and teams traditionally have turned to published IT frameworks and models. But defining, documenting, and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/ai-ops-transform-it-tb/aiops-tools-implementation?lx=my3YKV&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">automating your processes</a> are not enough.</p>
<p>For shared organizational processes to be sustainable and improved over the long term, you need to establish effective, accountable, and scalable governance and ownership roles. And for these to be effective, you need to create a shared vision, a collaborative culture, effective teaming models, and a shared tooling strategy.</p>
<p>Effective process and practice ownership require interest, time, skills, knowledge, passion, and authority.</p>
<p>Several well-known frameworks address this issue. Lean Six Sigma and COBIT identify the process owner role as a critical control. <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/enter-nexus-ken-schwaber-scaling-scrum-future-agile" rel="noopener">Agile Scrum</a> says that while self-managed teams have roles with accountability for process elements, the product owner is responsible for product outcomes, while the Scrum master is responsible for the processes.</p>
<p>ITIL describes the need for governance roles, such as process owners and coordinators, to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/it-service-management-tb/it-tools-practices?lx=-rqtPA&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">improve the productivity of ITSM practices.</a> These roles focus on process design, communication, awareness, and process advocacy.</p>
<p>Here are five foundational capabilities that will help nurture and sustain <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-pandemic?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener">any digital transformation practice or shared objective</a>, across complex value chains consisting of internal and external service organizations.</p>
<h3>1. Leadership: Creating systems thinking and constancy of purpose</h3>
<p>Your behavior and choices reflect the environment you come from, which includes both good and bad attributes demonstrated by current and past organizational leaders.</p>
<p>The tone at the top primarily determines an organization&#8217;s culture, ethics, focus, drive, direction, and willingness to collaborate. Leadership either intentionally programs organizational culture or develops haphazardly through workers&#8217; beliefs and experiences.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a direct correlation between an organization&#8217;s results and its culture, while, conversely, the culture&#8217;s relationship to the organization&#8217;s beliefs and experiences reflects its leadership.</p>
<p>In turn, there&#8217;s a direct correlation between an organization&#8217;s ability to establish effective <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/units/how-governance-change-depend-your-business-processes" rel="noopener">process governance</a> roles and how that organization&#8217;s leaders work with their peers and teams. Organizations in which senior leaders visibly align around common objectives and demonstrate their commitment are better able to establish this role as well as create coherence and a common approach across teams.</p>
<p>Systems thinking and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/transformational-leadership-what-every-devops-leader-needs-know" rel="noopener">lean leadership practices</a> stress that for a complex system to gain overall speed and velocity, stakeholders must share common values, beliefs, practices, and priorities. A main role of lean leadership is to create a constancy of purpose within the value system.</p>
<p>While you can partially accomplish this by planning systems and focusing on organizational culture, it also depends on <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/why-value-stream-management-success-hinges-flow-governance" rel="noopener">process governance</a>—which in turn depends on a leadership team that helps create a systems-thinking culture.</p>
<h3>2. Culture: Moving from silo-based to collaborative relationships and shared goals</h3>
<p>Both human societies and organizations have natural boundaries where our concept of &#8220;us&#8221; ends and we consider all others to be &#8220;them.&#8221; While this is normal, challenges can arise when our sense of whom we self-identify with is too narrow. Systems thinking centers on sharing the same values, beliefs, practices, and prioritization of work to effectively achieve common goals.</p>
<p>Establishing efficient process governance structures that cross multiple teams is largely impossible when the sense of &#8220;us&#8221; is narrow and limited. Building an agreement for shared and common practices within your silo isn&#8217;t a problem, but introducing a common practice into other groups in a highly siloed culture becomes almost impossible due to cultural constraints.</p>
<p>The solution is to widen the sense of &#8220;us&#8221; through systems thinking to establish trust-based relationships that reduce silo thinking and move relationships from transactional to cooperative and, ultimately, collaborative.</p>
<p><em>Figure 1. Readiness for collaboration happens when both parties have built initial trust and are prepared to form a working relationship where individual goals and desires are willingly subordinated to a shared set of values, beliefs, practices, and priorities that can co-create value. Source:</em> <em>AXELOS</em></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-new-it4it-reference-architecture-game-changer" rel="noopener">ITIL 4 models</a> can help organizations create this larger sense of identity and systems thinking, while enabling a culture and willingness to collaborate across teams.</p>
<h3>3. Structure: Creating velocity through cross-functional teams</h3>
<p>Vertically oriented structures and management systems are often based on turn-of-the-century design principles that focused on task specialization. While creating localized specialization is important, it can also negatively affect cross-functional collaboration.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s fast-paced, highly automated business environment requires both increased speed to market and faster innovation, so leaders must find ways to increase collaboration, engagement, and creativity across teams using shared processes and tools.</p>
<p>Traditional, top-down organizational structures are experimenting with <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/project-management-surefire-way-kill-your-software-product" rel="noopener">product-oriented cross-functional teams</a> for both development and support. These concepts have been in place for decades in other verticals that have adopted lean manufacturing principles.</p>
<p>The principle of cross-functional collaboration is not new. Developing a project team of members with specializations means forming a temporary teaming structure that shares values, goals, priorities, and outcome-based measures for which they are mutually accountable.</p>
<p>Recent discussion in the IT community has centered on transitioning the project team to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/projects-products-what-it-means-why-it-matters" rel="noopener">a semi-permanent, cross-functional product team</a>. This is not a new concept; Agile Scrum describes the development team and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-recruit-great-scrum-master" rel="noopener">the Scrum master role</a>. DevOps literature describes a DevOps team as having both development and operations members on a product-oriented team.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While people describe DevOps teams as full-stack, this doesn&#8217;t represent how most organizations use them. Most teams labeled &#8220;DevOps&#8221; are silo-based.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creating a team structure that includes the right skills and specializations results in a culture of collaboration that reduces silos and establishes a larger sense of &#8220;us.&#8221; This ultimately makes process ownership roles such as the Scrum master more effective.</p>
<h3>4. Performance: Moving to shared outcome versus activity-based measures</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-agile-coaches-measure-high-performance-spotify" rel="noopener">Highly effective teams</a> have shared outcome-based measures, rather than individual activity measures.</p>
<p>What is measured is important and, in many organizations, current performance management systems are tied to vertical organizational structures. Teams and individuals are measured on individual activity versus shared process or product outcomes.</p>
<p>The problem is that traditional performance measurement systems often contradict the aim of creating shared process goals. This negatively affects process governance roles; ultimately, people pay attention to what they are measured on.</p>
<h3>5. Automation: Moving from best-of-breed point solutions to integrated suites</h3>
<p>The desire to use shared tools for shared processes is the final foundational requirement for creating effective process governance. Achieving this goal depends on the previous four enablers.</p>
<p>Vertical, silo-based organization and team structures drive the acquisition process for tools and how they&#8217;re used. This aligns with the DevOps community&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/collective-ownership/" rel="nofollow noopener">description of Conway&#8217;s Law</a>: &#8220;Any organization that designs a system (defined more broadly here than just information systems) will inevitably produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization&#8217;s communication structure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unless you align your organization&#8217;s leadership, culture, team structure, and measurement systems around systems thinking and shared processes, the likelihood of adopting shared tools is quite low. Most organizations preach integrated solutions to their customers, but when it comes to their own acquisition of IT tools, they prefer best-of-breed point solutions over integrated suites.</p>
<p>The use of shared tools comes back to leadership and culture. To address this, leaders and teams must first resolve the following five questions before sharing tools. Can they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agree to agree to agree? (Engage in systems versus silo thinking.)</li>
<li>Agree on one way to do something? (Reduce complexity and variability.)</li>
<li>Agree to focus on simplifying how that should be done? (Focus on value-added activities and reducing waste.)</li>
<li>Agree to use one tool for collaboration? (Move to common tools for each category to improve collaboration and reduce technical debt.)</li>
<li>Agree on an integrated solution over a best-of-breed point solution? (Help automate delivery pipelines via systems integration.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Digital transformation requires effective processes</h3>
<p>To move from a reactive and low maturity to an improved ability to deliver value consistently and reliably, your organization must establish effective process governance. Ownership roles need to define, deploy, sustain, and improve those processes to support your organization&#8217;s objectives.</p>
<p>For these roles to fulfill their mandate, you need to have the five critical foundational enablers described above. And for most organizations, there&#8217;s much work left to do.</p>
<p><em>Learn how to implement the five foundational enablers with Troy DuMoulin and his colleagues as they offer practical recommendations and approaches for success at Pink Elephant&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pinkelephant.com/en-us/PinkInAction/Home" rel="nofollow noopener">ITIL 4 in Action</a> online symposium</em>. <em>The event takes place February 22 and 23, 2021.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>If you read my previous blog, <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/fast-testing-multiple-browsers/" rel="noopener">Fast Testing Across Multiple Browsers</a>, you know that participants in the <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/modern-cross-browser-testing-report/" rel="noopener">Applitools Ultrafast Cross Browser Hackathon</a> learned the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applitools <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/product-ultrafast-test-cloud/" rel="noopener">Ultrafast Grid</a> requires an application test to be run just once. Legacy approaches require repeating tests for each browser, operating system, and viewport size of interest.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/cross-browser-testing/" rel="noopener">Cross browser tests</a> and analysis complete typically within 10 minutes, meaning that test times match the scale of application build times. Legacy test and analysis times involve several hours to generate results</li>
<li>Applitools makes it possible to incorporate cross browser tests into the build process, with both speed and accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, we’re going to talk about another benefit of using Applitools Visual AI and Ultrafast Grid: test code stability.</p>
<h2 id="h-what-is-test-code-stability">What is Test Code Stability?</h2>
<p>Test code stability is the property of test code continuing to give consistent and appropriate results over time. With stable test code, tests that pass continue to pass correctly, and tests that fail continue to fail correctly. Stable tests do not generate false positives (report a failure in error) or generate false negatives (missing a failure).</p>
<p>Stable test code produces consistent results. Unstable test code requires maintenance to address the sources of instability. So, what causes test code instability?</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anandbagmar/" rel="noopener">Anand Bagmar</a> did a great <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/uncover-flaky-tests/" rel="noopener">review of the sources of flaky tests</a>. Some of the key sources of instability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Race conditions – you apply inputs too quickly to ensure a consistent output</li>
<li>Ignoring settling time – your output becomes stable only after your sampling time</li>
<li>Network delay – your network infrastructure causes unexpected behavior</li>
<li>Dynamic environments – your inputs cannot guarantee all the outputs</li>
<li>Incompletely scoped test conditions – you have not specified the correct changes</li>
<li>Myopia – you only look for expected changes and actual changes occur elsewhere</li>
<li>Code changes – your code uses obsolete controls or measures obsolete output.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you develop tests for an evolving application, code changes introduce the most instability in your tests. UI tests, whether testing the UI or complete end-to-end behavior, depends on the underlying UI code. You use your knowledge of the app code to build the test interfaces. Locator changes – whether changes to coded identifiers or CSS or Xpath locators – can cause your tests to break.</p>
<p>When test code depends on the App code, each app release will require test maintenance. Otherwise, no engineer can ensure that a “passing” test omitted an actual failure, or that  a “failing” test indicates a real failure and not a locator change.</p>
<h2 id="h-test-code-stability-and-cross-browser-testing">Test Code Stability and Cross Browser Testing</h2>
<p>Considering the instability sources, a tester like you takes on a huge challenge with cross browser tests. You need to ensure that your cross browser test infrastructure addresses these sources of instability so that your cross browser behavior matches expected results.</p>
<p>If you use a legacy approach to cross browser testing, you need to ensure that your physical infrastructure does not introduce network or other infrastructure sources of test flakiness.  Part of your maintenance ensures that your test infrastructure does not become a source of false positives or false negatives.  </p>
<p>Another check you make relates to responsive app design. How do you ensure responsive app behavior? How do you validate page location based on viewport size?</p>
<p>If you use legacy approaches, you spend a lot of time ensuring that your infrastructure, your tests, and your results all match expected app user behavior. In contrast, the Applitools approach does not require debugging and maintenance of multiple test infrastructures, since the purpose of the test involves ensuring proper rendering of server response.</p>
<p>Finally, you have to account for the impact of every new app coding change on your tests. How do you update your locators? How do you ensure that your test results match your expected user behavior?</p>
<h2 id="h-improving-stability-limiting-dependency-on-code-changes">Improving Stability: Limiting Dependency on Code Changes</h2>
<p>One thing we have observed over time: code changes drive test code maintenance. We demonstrated this dependency relationship in the Applitools Visual AI Rockstar Hackathon, and again in the Applitools Ultrafast Cross Browser Hackathon. </p>
<p>The legacy approach uses locators to both apply test conditions and measure application behavior. As locators can change from release to release, test authors must consider appropriate actions.</p>
<p>Many teams have tried to address the locator dependency in test code. </p>
<p>Some test developers sit inside the development team. They create their tests as they develop their application, and they build the dependencies into the app development process. This approach can ensure that locators remain current. On the flip side, they provide little information on how the application behavior changes over time. </p>
<p>Some developers provide a known set of identifiers in the development process. They work to ensure that the UI tests use a consistent set of identifiers. These tests can run the risk of myopic inspection. By depending on supplied identifiers – especially to measure application behavior, these tests run the risk of false negatives. While the identifiers do not change, they may no longer reflect the actual behavior of the application. </p>
<p>The modern approach limits identifier use to applying test conditions. Applitools Visual AI measures the application response of the UI. This approach still depends on identifier consistency – but with way fewer identifiers. In both hackathons, participants cut their dependence on identifiers by 75% to 90% – basically, they used way fewer identifiers. Their code ran more consistently and required less maintenance.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>
<h2 id="h-implications-of-modern-cross-browser-testing">Implications of Modern Cross Browser Testing</h2>
<p>Applitools Ultrafast Grid overcomes many of the hurdles that testers experience running legacy cross browser test approaches. Beyond the pure speed gains, Applitools offers improved stability and reduced test maintenance.</p>
<p>Modern cross browser testing reduces dependency on locators. By using Visual AI instead of locators to measure application response, Applitools Ultrafast Grid can show when an application behavior has changed – even if the locators remain the same. Or, alternatively, Ultrafast Grid can show when the behavior remains stable even though locators have changed. By reducing dependency on locators, Applitools ensures a higher degree of stability in test results.</p>
<p>Also, Applitools Ultrafast Grid reduces infrastructure setup and maintenance for cross browser tests. In the legacy setup, each unique browser requires its own setup and connection to the server. Each setup can have physical or other failure modes that must be identified and isolated independent of the application behavior. By capturing the response from a server once and validating the DOM across other target browsers, operating systems, and viewport sizes, Applitools reduces the infrastructure debug and maintenance efforts.</p>
<h2 id="h-conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Participant feedback from the Hackathon provided us with consistent views on cross browser testing. From their perspective, participants viewed legacy cross browser tests as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Likely to break on an app update</li>
<li>Susceptible to infrastructure problems</li>
<li>Expensive to maintain over time</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, they saw Applitools Ultrafast Grid as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less expensive to maintain</li>
<li>More likely to expose rendering errors</li>
<li>Providing more consistent results.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/modern-cross-browser-testing-report/" rel="noopener">read the entire report here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h-what-s-next">What’s Next</h2>
<p>What holds companies back from cross browser testing? Bad experiences getting results. But, what if they could get good test results and have a good experience at the same time? We ask participants about their experience on the Applitools Cross Browser Hackathon.</p>

<p><strong>A pile of high-value .com domains are still missing in action</strong> after they were stolen and resold by miscreants unknown. Perl.com was among them.</p>
<p><strong>Some observers are pointing the finger of blame</strong> at Web.com—specifically its subsidiary Network Solutions. Could this be the sex.com debacle all over again? That took <em>five years</em> to resolve.</p>
<p><strong>Hopefully perl.com will be back</strong> quicker than that. In this week’s <i><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/contributors/richi-jennings" rel="noopener">Security Blogwatch</a></i>, we sudo vi /etc/hosts.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://richi.uk/" rel="noopener nofollow" title="Richi Jennings">Your humble blogwatcher</a> curated these bloggy bits for your entertainment. Not to mention: <em>Poor old Windows.</em></p>
<h3>“How <em>you</em> dune?”</h3>
<p><strong>What’s the craic?</strong> Lawrence Abrams reports—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/perlcom-domain-stolen-now-using-ip-address-tied-to-malware/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Perl.com domain stolen, now using IP address tied to malware</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Perl.com is a site owned by Tom Christiansen and has been used since 1997 to post news and articles about the Perl programming language. … The domain was stolen in September 2020 while at Network Solutions, transferred to a registrar in China on Christmas Day, and finally moved to the Key-Systems registrar on January 27th.<br />…<br />It wasn&#8217;t until the last transfer that the IP addresses assigned to the domain were changed. … The IP address … has a long history of being used in … malware campaigns.<br />…<br />Until the domain hijacking is resolved, perl.org is recommending that users do not use perl.com as a CPAN mirror. [And] it is strongly advised not to visit perl.com until the domain is back in the hands of The Perl Foundation.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>And</strong> Richard Speed dashes off this—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/01/28/perl_hijacking/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Hijackers appear to have seized control of 33-year-old … domain</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>The hijack appears to have followed the age-old path of an attacker pouncing on a compromised account and swiping the domain. … Perl.org is unaffected.<br />…<br />Prior to the change, Tom Christiansen was listed as the domain administrative contact. … A hijacking of Christiansen&#8217;s account seems a possibility. … Shortly after the hijacking, the domain … turned up as available to buy for $190k on afternic.com [which] is part of the GoDaddy organisation.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>We turn to</strong> the famous capital letter-hating author brian d foy—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/briandfoy_perl/with_replies" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">@briandfoy_perl</a></i>—who tweets thuswise:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Huh, it looks like there was some snafu with the perl.com domain registration and now it&#8217;s registered under someone else. … The proper address for perl.com is 151.101.2.132. Put that in your /etc/hosts and you should get to the right site. … Anyone using a perl.com host for their CPAN mirror should use cpan.org instead.<br />…<br />We&#8217;ve temporarily set up the perl.com site at perldotcom.perl.org. … There&#8217;s no news on the recovery progress. Everyone who needs to be talking is talking to each other and it&#8217;s just a process now. … Network Solutions is working with Tom Christiansen, the rightful registrant, on the recovery of the perl.com domain.</p>
<p>There is no estimated timeline for its recovery but the process is underway. … We&#8217;re in the long, boring phase now.</p>
<p></em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>An isolated incident?</strong> Nope. Here’s <i><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25942367" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">bhartzer</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>I’ve seen other domains get stolen recently, it seems to be about the same time: patterns.com, piracy.com, perl.com … neurologist.com and chip.com. … All stolen at around the same time.<br />…<br />With Patterns, the thief hacked the Network Solutions account, put the domain under privacy, transferred it to a Chinese registrar, and then put the old whois data back. They then tried to sell it on Sedo and Afternic for 10 percent of what it’s worth.<br />…<br />My advice is to lock down your domains, register them for at least 5 years, and if there are changes deal with them quickly. … Definitely use 2FA if it’s offered … there are a lot of registrars still using less secure platforms. So moving to a more secure registrar can help.<br />…<br />Once a domain is transferred it’s much harder to get back. It can be done, but it’s a lot of work to unravel it all.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>A lot of work?</strong> As Dave Piscitello explained, a long time ago, <i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.icann.org/news/blog/documentation-is-key-to-recovering-hijacked-domain-names" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Documentation is Key</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>When victims of domain name hijackings contact our Security Team for guidance, we will ask …  &#8220;Do you have any way to demonstrate to your sponsoring registrar that the registration or use of the domain is rightfully yours?&#8221; … Sadly, many parties who contact us haven&#8217;t considered that they will have to prove that the domain is theirs to use.<br />…<br />You will need to provide documentation to registrars or dispute resolution service provider that proves an association existed between you … (the one who has legitimately registered the domain name) and the hijacked domain name or account, prior to the incident.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>But how could this happen</strong> at a totally legit registrar such as NetSol? <i><a target="_blank" href="https://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=18156794&amp;cid=61011738" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">gmack</a></i> scoffs at the thought:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You make it sound like Network Solutions has never made that sort of mistake before. NetSol is one of the least secure registrars and has a history of transferring domains over the phone or with a fax.</p>
<p>The most famous case was of course sex.com where they argued that they had no responsibility to even try to fix the problem. There are still scattered reports of domains being stolen from them.</p>
<p></em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>But</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25942884" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">fogihujy</a></i> is a touch more circumspect:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There&#8217;s always the chance someone social-engineered their way past the registrar&#8217;s access control, or that they got some kind of access to the registrar&#8217;s systems. Or the domain owner simply didn&#8217;t read an email properly and clicked the wrong link.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s too little information to draw conclusions at this point.</p>
<p></em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Back in my day</strong> everyone on the internet was nice. <i><a target="_blank" href="https://forums.theregister.com/forum/all/2021/01/28/perl_hijacking/#c_4195754" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">drankinatty</a></i> waxes prosaic:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Not too long ago … domain registration and ownership was a simple matter, whois noted all details, including name, addresses, telephone (and fax) numbers and e-mail addresses. Not a care or thought was given to the registration details being available in the world of the honest actor.</p>
<p>But since that time, [as with] all manner of life and politics, dishonest actors, so lacking in integrity and moral character, set about making mischief and perverting every aspect of available information and data, either for personal gain or to sow general chaos. To such an extent that if you look at the time, toil, resources and effort expended in defensive measures, it likely surpasses the amounts spent in the pursuit of normal business operations.<br />…<br />Having experienced the world pre–NCSA Mosaic … it is truly a sad reflection on humanity.</p>
<p></em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>If only we knew how it happened.</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25943628" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">classichasclass</a></i> thinks they do:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>[Floodgap.com] was part of this. I just talked to a very helpful person in NetSol&#8217;s security department and she looked through the ticket. It was initiated by a web chat, and they produced official looking but completely fraudulent documents (photo ID, utility bill, business license, etc.) to prove identity.</p>
<p>So this was socially engineered and apparently for multiple domains. They&#8217;re supposed to contact me tomorrow for more on the post mortem.</p>
<p></em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Meanwhile,</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://forums.theregister.com/forum/all/2021/01/28/perl_hijacking/#c_4195504" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">GBE</a></i> goes all poetic on us:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I used to dislike Perl. Then I learned PHP in order to maintain a pile of somebody else&#8217;s code. And my feelings for Perl faded into insignificance.</p>
<p>Then I met a beggar who had no feet. And thought to myself, &#8220;At least he doesn&#8217;t have to maintain PHP code.&#8221;</p>
<p></em></p></blockquote>
<h3>The moral of the story?</h3>
<p>Do whatever you can to prevent your domains getting stolen, including MFA and red-teaming a social-engineering attack on your registrar.</p>
<h3>And finally</h3>
