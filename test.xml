										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Building an inclusive work environment, particularly in terms of people with disabilities, is a mental and a cultural shift that has to be part of a company&#8217;s core values and what it wants to drive across the organization, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/sbarutch" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Semra Barutchu</a>, Infosys&#8217; vice president and head of engineering services for Asia.</p>
<p>To that end, Infosys has introduced guidelines to ensure it supports the <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/why-you-should-build-accessibility-start" rel="noopener noreferrer">integration of people with disabilities</a>, and it provides various internal departments with specific information on how to make it easier to integrate these individuals, Barutchu said in the latest INSPIRE 20 podcast.</p>
<h3>The INSPIRE 20 podcast series</h3>
<p>Barutchu is one of the executives taking part in INSPIRE 20, a new podcast series that showcases 20 executives from around the world who are making a difference in terms of inclusion and diversity in their organizations, communities, and/or industries.</p>
<p><iframe allow="autoplay" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/889776454&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no"></iframe> </p>
<p><em>Listen to the podcast with Semra Barutchu on <a target="_blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/inspire-20/id1510305176?i=1000496363343" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Apple Podcasts</a>,<strong> </strong><a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/user-699370465/micro-focus-inspire20-semra-barutchu" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SoundCloud</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5JIUmSImVtwNhck5PDOoWM" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Spotify</a>. Plus: Catch up with all of the <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/inspire-20-podcast-series-tb?_ga=2.169902311.652887837.1600691415-1617140538.1596457935" rel="noopener noreferrer">INSPIRE 20 series podcasts here</a>. </em></p>
<h3>A &#8216;strategic builder&#8217;</h3>
<p>Barutchu joined Infosys in 2013 to lead the engineering business unit across Australia and New Zealand and, subsequently, throughout Asia. She is known as a strategic business builder, specializing in all aspects of engineering services.</p>
<p>Her extensive knowledge and experience of the Asia market allow her to provide expertise in leading regional change programs focused on improving performance, quality, service, and profitability.</p>
<p>Barutchu enjoys promoting careers in information and communications technology to women who may become future leaders in the field. She has volunteered as a committee member for Females in Information Technology for a number of years.</p>
<h3>Driving successful diversity programs</h3>
<p>In the podcast, Barutchu talks about the success Infosys has had when it comes to inclusion and diversity and shares some of the diversity initiatives Infosys is driving in the broader community.</p>
<p>Additionally, Barutchu discusses her role in creating inclusion through social outreach, including her collaboration with the NASSCOM (National Association of Software and Service Companies) Foundation to set up a National Digital Literacy Mission center to empower people with disabilities.</p>
<p>The foundation is NASSCOM&#8217;s social arm that works with the tech industry to achieve social transformation and make an impact through technology in the developing world. The foundation works with the community to encourage and drive inclusion in the community itself, through education as well as by helping people find jobs, or just by creating a more inclusive environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is so much we take for granted that is actually critical for these individuals,&#8221; Barutchu said. &#8220;Unless you&#8217;ve actually lived with people that have various disabilities or you&#8217;re associated with an organization&#8221; that works with people with disabilities, &#8220;you don&#8217;t have an awareness,&#8221; she said.</p>

            </div>
<p>McAfee MVISION Cloud was the first to market with a CASB solution to address the need to secure corporate data in the cloud. Since then, Gartner has published several reports dedicated to the CASB market, which is a testament to the critical role CASBs play in enabling enterprise cloud adoption. Today, Gartner named McAfee a Leader in the 2020 annual <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/lp/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-casb.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB)</a> for the fourth time evaluating CASB vendors.</p>
<p>Cloud access security brokers have become an essential element of any cloud security strategy, helping organizations govern the use of cloud and protect sensitive data in the cloud. Security and risk management leaders concerned about their organizations’ cloud use should investigate CASBs.</p>
<p>In its fourth Magic Quadrant for Cloud Access Security Brokers, Gartner evaluated eight vendors that met its inclusion criteria. MVISION Cloud, as part of the MVISION family of products at McAfee, is recognized as a Leader in the report; and for the fourth year in a row. To learn more about how Gartner assessed the market and MVISION Cloud, download your copy of the report <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/lp/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-casb.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>

<p>This year, Gartner commissioned a highly rigorous process to compile its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/lp/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-casb.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB)</a> report and they relied on numerous inputs to compile the report, including these materials from vendors to understand their product offerings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Questionnaire</strong> – A 300+ point questionnaire resulting in hundreds of pages of responses</li>
<li><strong>Financials</strong> – Detailed company financial data covering CASB revenue</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> – Access to all product documentation</li>
<li><strong>Customer Peer Reviews </strong>– Gartner encourages customers to submit anonymized reviews via their Peer Insights program.

<li><strong>Demo</strong> – Covering over 50 Gartner-defined use cases to validate product capabilities</li>

<p>McAfee also received <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/about/newsroom/press-releases/press-release.html?news_id=067f564a-2935-440e-b8e0-d695c37ca0a3" rel="noopener noreferrer">recognition</a> as the only vendor to be named the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/cloud-access-security-brokers" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 2020 Gartner Peer Insights Customers’ Choice for Cloud Access Security Brokers</a> based on customer feedback and ratings for McAfee MVISION Cloud.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.drupal.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drupal </a>is an open-source content management system used to build websites and applications. Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need. In this article, we’ll show you how to effectively test Drupal websites and applications using cutting edge vision based technology.</p>
<h3 id="h.aid1r6pznvc2">Why do people prefer Drupal over other Open Source CMS’s?</h3>
<ul>
<li> Reliability and scalability </li>
<li> Security </li>
<li> Easing out the complexity of the site </li>
<li>It is multilingual </li>
<li>Flexibility of Drupal</li>
<li>Easy for SEO</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vardot.com/en-us/ideas/blog/why-drupal-best-cms-your-website" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.vardot.com/en-us/ideas/blog/why-Drupal-best-cms-your-website</a> for more information on above.</p>
<p>The digital landscape is changing, and with it are increasing demands on content management systems (CMSes) and organisations to keep pace with consumer needs. Users are demanding more personalised <a target="_blank" href="https://www.origineight.net/o8dx?__hstc=39244668.dd7233d964b6f2f7cd114bc5000b2b0e.1599367142010.1599367142010.1599367142010.1&amp;__hssc=39244668.1.1599367142011&amp;__hsfp=2647981047" rel="noopener noreferrer">experiences</a>, more excellent connectivity between devices, and more interactive elements in their web experiences.</p>
<p>Organisations want websites that grow with your digital technology and business needs and help you achieve your goals. Drupal is helping organisations to meet these demands.</p>
<h2 id="h.mj1qmrxtnkw2">How do we test Drupal-powered websites?</h2>
<p>Drupal provides enormous benefits for building customer experience and at the same times poses challenges for testing also.</p>
<p>Drupal sites are full of content, and variations to the content can cause below issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantity of content</li>
<li>Length of the content</li>
<li>Interlinking between content</li>
<li>Different types of media</li>
<li>Language</li>
<li>Formatting</li>
</ul>
<p>If a website includes a content import component, doing this at the beginning of a project is a great way to ensure that real content is tested as the site’s functionality is built.</p>
<p>For user-generated content, creating a suite of realistic test content that includes a variety of what users might enter is an excellent investment of time at the beginning of the project.</p>
<p>Most organisations assume Drupal handles below areas automatically, or they will “just work”.</p>
<ul>
<li>Responsive web testing</li>
<li>Compatible with dynamic content</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Support multilingual</li>
<li>Performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Drupal developers are performing a quick check on one browser(mostly chrome) during development and assume testing team or content management team will be able to check other browser and device combinations before releasing to customers.</p>
<p>Organisations are increasingly writing scripted tests with tools like Selenium, and Cypress etc. can be repeated and tested frequently to cover above requirements. Areas of testing like usability, design features are challenging to test in a scripted fashion. Exploratory testing(manual) done by developers or content management teams will not be able to catch all issues.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote">

<p>“Areas of testing like usability, design features are challenging to test in a scripted fashion. Exploratory testing(manual) done by developers or content management teams will not be able to catch all issues.”</p>
</blockquote>
</figure>
<p>The best approach is to have a solution that can help Drupal developers to quickly validate the changes and authoring team(content changed) validated across all aspects of user experience.</p>
<h2 id="h.z7h2iiadxgkr">Testing Drupal with Visual AI</h2>
<p>Applitools Visual AI is an option to explore that has capabilities to overcome some of the challenges. Let’s see in detail on Applitools, and it’s capabilities.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools </a>Visual AI, the industries only AI-powered, deep learning, computer vision that replicates the human eyes and brain.</p>
<p>Through Visual AI, comes incredible efficiency allowing tests to be created faster, tests executed in seconds on devices/browser combinations ensuring perfection across all browsers, screens and viewports combined with web accessibility compliance testing at the same time.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example to discuss testing a website built with Drupal.</p>
<p>I have taken <a target="_blank" href="https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/</a> website built on Drupal and using Selenium Java for testing the responsive web design, accessibility and functionality with Applitools.</p>
<p>Refer to the <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/selenium-java.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools – Selenium –</a>Tutorial for step by step guide to writing/execute the test.</p>
<p>Test completed in <strong>24 secs testing full-page( top to bottom) on 49 viewport and screen sizes.</strong></p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"></figure>
</div>
<p>The test is executed on Desktop and device browser combinations as shown below,</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1001" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4.png" alt="pasted image 0 4" class="wp-image-24164" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4.png 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4-300x188.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4-1024x641.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4-768x480.png 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4-1536x961.png 1536w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4-335x211.png 335w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
</div>
<p>Regression testing on the same page is executed on all the same combinations covering desktop and mobile devices. Here full-page is compared with the previous run, and Visual AI has validated below on the page using Strict Algorithm,</p>
<ul>
<li>Text</li>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Color &amp; Contrast</li>
<li>Position and alignment</li>
</ul>
<p>Applitools Visual AI has multiple <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/automated-visual-testing-best-practices-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer">algorithms </a>that can be used for validating different use cases.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="903" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4.jpg" alt="pasted image 0 4" class="wp-image-24163" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4.jpg 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4-300x169.jpg 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4-1024x578.jpg 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4-768x433.jpg 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4-1536x867.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
</div>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="918" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-3.jpg" alt="pasted image 0 3" class="wp-image-24161" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-3.jpg 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-3-300x172.jpg 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-3-1024x588.jpg 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-3-768x441.jpg 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-3-1536x881.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
</div>
<p>Visual AI comparison can be used to validate the look and feel of a particular component, element or region of a page.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="848" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2.png" alt="pasted image 0 2" class="wp-image-24160" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2.png 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-300x159.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1024x543.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-768x407.png 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1536x814.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
<p>Now, what if there are differences on the UI after dev changes. Wouldn’t it be great to know the reason for the difference? Applitools platform has “Root Cause Analysis” that provides the root cause as shown below,</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="863" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2.jpg" alt="pasted image 0 2" class="wp-image-24158" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2.jpg 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-300x162.jpg 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1024x552.jpg 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-768x414.jpg 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1536x828.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
</div>
<p>At the same time, while we are testing the UI, what if we get to know the website has met the accessibility guidelines or not without writing a line of code? See below.</p>
<p>Applitools Visual AI validates the screen elements and provides a status of accessibility.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="890" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1.jpg" alt="pasted image 0 2 1" class="wp-image-24159" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1.jpg 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1-300x167.jpg 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1-1024x570.jpg 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1-768x427.jpg 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1-1536x854.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
</div>
<p>What’s next after this, testers validate the results and accept/reject the latest screenshot with a click of a button.</p>
<p>Here are other capabilities that the Applitools platform provides to help in End to End development of Drupal sites,</p>
<h3 id="h.oxxy6i5crc1g">Benefits of Testing Drupal with Applitools</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>We just announced that <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/platform/analytics-performance/sauce-performance" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sauce Performance</a> is now available on all Sauce accounts including free trial, self serve, and Enterprise. Sauce Performance is a performance testing tool that allows developers to test the front-end performance of applications in the Sauce platform at no additional cost. Rather than testing performance at the end of the testing cycle with a third party application, Sauce users can test the front-end performance of their application at the beginning of the testing cycle. </p>
<h3>How to Get Sauce Performance Setup with Selenium Tests</h3>
<p>Sauce Performance is set up with machine learning-derived baselines with Google Lighthouse (recently updated to version 6) and a front-end audit and history. You can begin the process of creating performance tests by leveraging existing Selenium tests as well. While this shouldn’t be your process every time, it can be a very easy way to get started.</p>
<p>In this example below, you can see how to start capturing web application performance for existing Selenium tests: </p>
<div class="image"><picture><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/6fAgRJvLDJprYI8ZNzOhHG/89f8ccaa09241afe788e4a295b38131f/performance_selenium.png?fm=webp" type="image/webp"/></picture></div>
<p>Sauce Performance is currently only available for tests executed on the latest three versions of Google Chrome. </p>
<p>While many testers might want to use their current Selenium tests, there are also some other best practices to follow to ensure you are getting the best results from your performance tests.</p>
<h3>General Best Practices for Sauce Performance </h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Separate performance and functional tests: </b>As front end performance tests serve a different objective than functional tests, you want to separate them from GUI tests and make them a separate step in your CI pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Run performance tests on only a single operating system: </b>Typically, users see more predictable results when running tests against Chrome on a single dedicated OS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Choose metrics that align with your application/user needs: </b>Sauce Performance allows users to validate front-end performance regressions across a wide range of metrics (Performance Score, Time to Interactive, Time to First Meaningful Paint, etc.). We recommend exploring verifications across a mix of metrics that closely align with the most important desired end-user experiences you wish to achieve. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Optimize your scripts for performance: </b>While Sauce Performance is able to validate metrics/regressions around page loads, users should be aware of other actions the test script is performing (e.g., assertions for the presence of content on the page) and determine if they are necessary in gathering performance metrics. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Focus on core app experiences first: </b>Performance testing and validations should focus on core application experiences as a start. Prioritize your performance validations the same as you would your frontend functional tests—test key pages more frequently. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these best practices, getting Sauce Performance up and running with your Sauce account is easy and efficient. Once Sauce Performance is integrated into your pipeline, your team will be able to have a single quality signal for your functional and performance tests getting you one step closer to feeling digitally confident.</p>
<h3>Test Performance for Yourself!</h3>
<p>Sauce Performance is now enabled across the entire Sauce Labs platform and you can even access it on the free trial. Go ahead and give it a try on our<a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/sign-up" rel="noopener noreferrer"> free trial</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/sales" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact us</a> to learn more about the Sauce platform.</p>

            </div>
<p> </p>
<h2>Election 2020: Keep on the Lookout for Fake News Before and After the Election</h2>
<p>As the news and conversations leading up to Election Day intensify, and with early voting already in full swing, the flood of misinformation and outright disinformation online continues—and will undoubtedly continue in the days after as the results are tabulated and announced.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ve seen some instances of it yourself. For instance, one recent news story reported that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ballots-california-landfill/" rel="noopener noreferrer">numerous legitimate social media accounts have shared misinformation about the vote</a>. An example: photos of old, empty election envelopes that were properly disposed of after the 2018 election, used to make the false claim that they were uncounted votes from the 2020 election. It’d be naïve for us to think that postings like this, and others, would suddenly come to a halt on Election Day.</p>
<h3>We can expect election misinformation to continue even after Election Day</h3>
<p>I touched upon this topic in my earlier blog about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/election-2020-keep-misinformation-from-undermining-the-vote/" rel="noopener noreferrer">how misinformation online</a> can undermine our election, yet it’s worthy of underscoring once again. It’s easy for our attention to focus on the days leading up to the election, however, this election stands to be like few others as the high volume of mail-in ballots may keep us from knowing who the certified victor is for possibly weeks after Election Day.<br />How that timeline plays out in practice remains to be seen, yet we should all prepare ourselves for a glut of continued misinformation and disinformation that aims to cloud the process. Feeds will get filled with it, and it’ll be up to us to make sense of what’s true and what’s false out there.</p>
<h3>Who is fact checking posts on social media sites?</h3>
<p>Sadly, much of onus for fact-checking will fall on us, particularly when <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2019/10/11/more-americans-are-getting-their-news-from-social-media/#5021c96c3e17" rel="noopener noreferrer">55% of Americans say</a> they “often” or “sometimes” get their news via social media. There are a few reasons why:</p>
<p>• First, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2020/fact-checkers-support-twitter-labels-but-more-than-that-they-want-transparency/" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media platforms are new to fact-checking</a> and their processes are still developing, particularly around the transparency of their fact-checking methodology;<br />• Secondly, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-twitter-fact-checking-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer">corporate leadership of the two major social media platforms</a> have stated differing views about fact checking on their platforms;<br />• And third, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/every-minute-internet-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer">sheer volume of posts</a> that these platforms pump out in any given day (or minute!) make it difficult to fact-check posts at scale.</p>
<p>Where does that leave us? In unprecedented times.</p>
<p>Historically, we’ve always had to be savvy consumers of news, where a balanced diet of media consumption allowed us to develop a clearer picture of events. Yet now, in a time of unfiltered social media, news comes to us from a multitude of publishers, bloggers, and individuals. And within that mix, it’s difficult to immediately know who the editorial teams behind those stories are—what their intentions, credentials, and leanings are—and if they’re drawing their information from bona fide, verified sources. The result is that we must read and view everything today with an increased level of healthy skepticism.</p>
<h3>Fact-checking your news</h3>
<p>That takes work, yet my recent blog on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/spot-fake-news-and-misinformation-in-your-social-media-feed/" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Spot Fake News and Misinformation in Your Social Media Feed</a> offers you a leg up with several pointers to help you sniff out potential falsehoods.<br />In addition, here’s a short list of fact-checking resources that you can turn to when something questionable comes up in your feed. Likewise, they make for good browsing even if you don’t have a specific story that you want to check up on. You can keep these handy:</p>
<p>• <a target="_blank" href="https://www.politifact.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PolitiFact</a> from the Poynter Institute<br />• <a target="_blank" href="https://www.factcheck.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">FactCheck.org</a> from the Annenberg Public Policy Center<br />• <a target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ap-fact-check" rel="noopener noreferrer">AP News Fact Check</a> from the Associated Press<br />• <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/fact-check" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters Fact Check</a> from Reuters News<br />• <a target="_blank" href="https://www.snopes.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snopes.com</a> from Snopes Media Group</p>
<h3>Stay vigilant</h3>
<p>With the election just days away and a result that may not be declared at the end of Election Day, we all need to scrutinize the news that presents itself to us, particularly on social media. Fact-checking what you see and read, along with cross-referencing it with multiple, reputable sources, will help you get the best information possible—which is absolutely vital when it comes time to cast your ballot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Agile and DevOps have defined the last two decades in software delivery. Value stream management (VSM) will define the next one.</p>
<p>Even as recently as 2000, there was little information about agile and few jobs calling for expertise in that area. Ten years ago, the same was true for DevOps. Today a similar situation exists if you search for VSM.</p>
<p>While many <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/devops-careers-tb/7-key-devops-roles?lx=vimF_R&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">careers have been built around agile and DevOps </a>over the past 20 years, it has not been enough to help enterprises truly compete in the increasingly digital world.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/6-key-value-streams-drive-digital-transformation" rel="noopener noreferrer">VSM is fundamentally different</a> because it looks holistically from ideation to delivery and will deliver on the promises that agile and DevOps could never fulfill. Here&#8217;s why, and what your software team needs to know.</p>
<h3>DevOps is part of a bigger picture</h3>
<p>Agile sped up development to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb/high-perf-continuous-delivery?lx=-DC2cJ&amp;custom_url=continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">accelerate value delivery</a>, while DevOps removed the bottlenecks between development and operations for further gains. Yet that&#8217;s only part of the value stream.</p>
<p>Being good at CI/CD and code-to-cloud are necessary, but they are insufficient to remain competitive, given the breakneck speed of tech developments.</p>
<p>You must consider the end-to-end flow of <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/optimize-devops-tb/devops-scale-software-factory?lx=vm26kZ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">all the software delivery work</a> that creates and protects business value. After all, most organizations spend half their time and half the budgeted money before a card ever gets to a development team&#8217;s backlog.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why VSM is vital: It doesn’t just focus on accelerating one silo; it focuses on accelerating the whole system.</p>
<h3>What VSM helps you do</h3>
<p><span>VSM in software delivery is a progressively maturing practice that takes a systematic approach to measure and improving end-to-end flow. It helps organizations to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Shorten time-to-market</span></li>
<li><span>Increase throughput</span></li>
<li><span>Improve product quality</span></li>
<li><span>Optimize for business outcomes, such as increased revenue and customer retention</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top:12.0pt; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt">Accelerating value work requires an understanding of what value is. In <a target="_blank" href="https://projecttoproduct.org/the-book/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><em>Project to Product</em>,</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/mik_kersten" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mik Kersten</a> helps technology leaders articulate that by defining four flow items that someone is willing to exchange for an economic unit.</p>
<p style="margin-top:12.0pt; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt">This data is abstracted from complex software delivery tool chains that enterprises use to manage the complex flow of work. Flow items deliver:</p>
<p style="margin-top:12.0pt; margin-right:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt"> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Features: New business value</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fewer defects: Quality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk management: Security, governance, compliance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical debt reduction: Removals of impediments to future delivery</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An organization’s focus must be on prioritizing, optimizing, and balancing the flow of these items across your software portfolio.</p>
<p>For that, you need the right type of measurement. As <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/adrianco" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Adrian Cockcroft</a>, vice president of cloud architecture strategy at Amazon Web Services, puts it in <em><a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/cloud-for-ceos/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cloud for CEOs</a></em>: &#8220;The most critical metric is how long it takes for an innovative idea to reach a customer. If it takes your company months, how can you compete with an organization that delivers in days?&#8221;</p>
<h3>New practices require new measures</h3>
<p>Unlike &#8220;discipline&#8221; metrics that focus on activities in a specific area of the value stream (such as DORA and DevOps), VSM requires <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/devops-value-stream-mapping-why-you-need-metrics" rel="noopener noreferrer">end-to-end metrics</a> that rise above all practices and processes to focus on the flow of business value.</p>
<p>These metrics need to measure the rate of business value delivery for software products through the lens of your customers (whether internal or external) to help you understand your current state.</p>
<p>They allow you to determine where work is flowing and, more importantly, where it isn’t. They provide shared visibility into business and development metrics for everyone involved in the value stream. That includes members of the leadership team, who are often balancing resources and budgets across a portfolio. Where will those budgets produce the highest ROI in terms of improved flow?</p>
<p>Here are a few metrics that will help you measure this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flow velocity</strong> gauges whether value delivery is accelerating. It is the number of flow items of each type completed over a particular period of time, allowing you to measure throughput.</li>
<li><strong>Flow time</strong> can identify when time-to-value is getting longer. It measures the time it takes for flow items to go from &#8220;work start&#8221; to &#8220;work complete,&#8221; including both active and wait times. This allows you to measure time-to-market, to ensure your throughput is fast enough for the short feedback cycles needed when dealing with uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>Flow efficiency</strong> can identify when waste is increasing or decreasing in your processes. It is the ratio of active time versus wait time out of the total flow time.</li>
<li><strong>Flow load</strong> monitors over- and under-utilization of value streams, which can lead to reduced productivity. It measures the number of flow items currently in progress (active or waiting) within a particular value stream.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flow time provides a customer- and business-centric measure of time-to-market, and flow velocity does the same for throughput. Flow efficiency measures how effective investment turns into value, and flow load is an early-warning indicator of overloaded value streams declining due to too much work-in-progress.</p>
<p>Each of these is based on end-to-end flow through a value stream. For example, the flow time clock starts when work is started—for instance, via a commitment to a plan item or objective. It does not stop until running software has been delivered.</p>
<p>As such, these measurements avoid the pitfalls associated with measuring just the cycle time of development or the time from code commit to code deploy, which can be an order of magnitude shorter than the bottlenecks upstream of development.</p>
<p>Using these value stream metrics, we can glean insights to create a culture based on data-driven continuous improvement.</p>
<h3>Reach the summit of data-driven continuous improvement</h3>
<p>Many teams appear mature in their use of agile and DevOps practices but are not mature when it comes to the cultural side of implementing continuous improvement.</p>
<p>First, how are your teams measuring maturity? Is the goal to do DevOps well? Are you measuring outcomes, or are you simply measuring activities? The goal is not to implement all of the DevOps practices; it is to accelerate the delivery and protection of business value.</p>
<p>Maybe you don&#8217;t need to put all DevOps practices into play. Maybe different teams <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/whats-wrong-your-value-stream-mapping" rel="noopener noreferrer">need different practices</a>. It&#8217;s a mistake to simply implement this practice or that one without having a measure of what it can provide from the perspective of the business.</p>
<p>You’ve got to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-you-should-drop-it-speak-measure-success-business-terms" rel="noopener noreferrer">know what the business needs</a> first—what is the problem? What will unlock the flow of business value?</p>
<p>The age of VSM is about measuring what matters in terms of business results. This provides the ability to look at these problems differently. You need to create a continuous feedback loop between IT and the business, to supercharge market response and adaptability to compete with the giants of the digital age.</p>
