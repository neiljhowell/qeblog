					<description><![CDATA[Nobody enjoys denying a request, and especially not a service desk team member whose job it is to find solutions]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Nobody enjoys denying a request, and especially not a service desk team member whose job it is to find solutions and help. One of the hardest things for a service employee to do is to say no. But sometimes it must be done.</p>
<p>If you use a service catalog, you have already made a choice about which services will be supported by your team. And that&#8217;s an excellent thing.</p>
<p>But your customers might not know about the decisions you&#8217;ve made. That means that they will file requests for services that you don&#8217;t support. You need to teach your team the best way to say no while leaving customers feeling as if their needs are being met—particularly if your organization is trying to build the business case to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/extend-it-service-management?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">extend IT service management to the rest of the enterprise</a>. Here&#8217;s how to say no.</p>
<p><em>[ Get up to speed on <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/it-operations-monitoring-tb?utm_campaign=00134846&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_source=techbeacon" rel="noopener noreferrer">IT Operations Monitoring with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide</a>.

<h2>1. Find out what your customer really needs</h2>
<p>Imagine your customer asks for an iPad, but you support only Android devices. Ask why the customer wants an iPad. What are her needs, and why does she think that an Android tablet can’t meet those needs?</p>
<p>Always ask your customer why she has made a particular request. Maybe she requested an iPad simply because she doesn’t understand all the possibilities offered by Android products. Perhaps you can educate your customers by providing some instructions or by installing an app.</p>
<h3>2. Propose an alternative standard solution</h3>
<p>As soon as you know your customer&#8217;s needs, it becomes easier to find an alternative for the request that you aren&#8217;t able to fulfill.</p>
<p>Ideally, you will have an alternative standard service that fully meets your customer&#8217;s needs. That will make the customer happy and save you time and resources.</p>
<p>But if you don&#8217;t have a standard service that fits, you can likely offer an alternative that at least partially meets your customer&#8217;s needs. In this case, you need to ask yourself how important the missing functionality is for your customer.</p>
<p>If the customer requests an iPad you don&#8217;t support, does the Android tablet you do support help meet your customer&#8217;s most essential needs? Try to steer your customer toward the alternative solution.</p>
<p><em>[ Robotic Process Automation can do mundane tasks, allowing you to get strategic. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/8743/396776?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Find out how in this April 28 Webinar.</a></em> <em>Plus</em><em>: Learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/robotic-process-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to roll out RPA</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide. ]</em></p>
<h2>3. Propose a custom solution</h2>
<p>If you can&#8217;t offer a standard service that meets your customer&#8217;s expectations, determine whether you can offer a custom one. Ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it technically feasible to provide a custom solution for the requestor?</li>
<li>If the answer to the first question is yes, ask yourself:
<ol>
<li>Do you want to offer this alternative?</li>
<li>Does it fit the policies and strategies of the IT department?</li>
<li>Will it take a lot of time to provide the alternative solution?</li>
<li>What is the impact on security?</li>
<li>Are you able to maintain the solution?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If the custom solution is technically possible and you believe it&#8217;s a good idea, move on to these next questions:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Does the custom solution fit your customer&#8217;s budget?</li>
<li>Will you be able to invoice their department for it so it won’t impact your IT department’s bottom line?</li>
</ol>
<p>If the answer is yes to all of the questions above, you can deliver the customer solution, but then you’ll need to think about another question: Do you want to add this service to your standard services? If so, add it to your service catalog.</p>
<h2>Be prepared to say no</h2>
<p>It can be difficult for your team members to say no. They want to help, and denying a request could make them feel like they&#8217;re not trying. But sometimes there is no choice. You can’t adhere to policies for your department if you say yes to everything.</p>
<p>And, even if the answer to an initial request is no, your team can still go above and beyond by offering alternatives or custom solutions.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The Talk</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Angie and Jessica broke the talk into three parts. First, Angie would discuss factors anyone should consider in creating automated tests. Second, Angie and Jessica would demonstrate writing UI tests for a test application.  Finally, they would work on adding UI tests to a CI/CD pipeline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s get into the meat of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Four Factors to Consider in Automated Tests</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Angie first introduced the four factors you need to consider when creating test automation:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Speed</li><li>Reliability</li><li>Quantity</li><li>Maintenance</li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>She went through each in turn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Speed</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Angie started off by making this point:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When your team checks in code, they want to know if the check-in is good as quickly as possible. Meaning, not overnight, not hours from now.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/mXgMmSJZi6QTJ7VR8DPbAKUZ5zpzzqw7KNMHcuBAxDa_WRNlFPL2f8qSh7yDv4gJ9vbnG546Qlfh5Ez7FyF5twKF1iHMGMuZxBM-yI-C3YDIKu0Z7BfLT8MtRfvX94i2BfwBAEwL" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Angie points out that the talk covers UI tests primarily because lots of engineers struggle with  UI testing. However, most of your check-in tests should not be UI tests because they run relatively slowly.  From this she referred to the testing pyramid idea</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Most of your tests are unit tests – they run the fastest and should pass (especially if written by the same team that wrote the code)</li><li>The next largest group is either system-level or business-layer tests. These tests don’t require a user interface and show the functionality of units working together</li><li>UI tests have the smallest number of total tests and should provide sufficient coverage to give you confidence in the user-level behavior.</li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>While UI tests take time, Angie points out that they are the only tests showing user experience of your application. So, don’t skimp on UI tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having said that, when UI tests become part of your build, you need to make sure that your build time doesn’t become bogged down with your UI tests. If all your conditions run over 15 minutes, that’s way too long. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To keep your testing to a minimum, Angie suggests running UI tests in parallel. To determine whether or not  you need to split up one test into several parallel tests, give yourself a time limit. Let’s say your build needs to complete in five minutes. Once you have a time limit, you can figure out how many parallel tests to set up. Like – with the 15 minute example, you might need to divide into three or more parallel tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Reliability</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, you need reliable tests. Dependable. Consistent. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CMF5FlZ3mwk31iqg4kymlyO2N_L6SYP4N8pG4buXlrizrXdsumgEdTQ06xIOSGAg596HXOweO1O34FdDJTNmXOncYITOGvN0qplZhk3crpKg-S0sP3G1frAK1f1jNDPXEJGZ_GXO" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unreliable tests interfere with CI processes. False negatives, said Angie, plague your team by making them waste time tracking down errors that don’t exist. False positives, she continues, corrupt your product by permitting the check-in of defective code. And, false positives corrupt your team because bugs found later in the process interfere with team cohesion and team trust. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For every successful CICD team, check-in success serves as the standard for writing quality code. You need reliable tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How do you make your tests reliable?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Angie has a suggestion that you make sure your app includes testability – which involves you leaning on your team. If you develop code, grab one of your test counterparts. If you test, sit down with your development team. Take the opportunity to discuss app testability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What makes an app testable? Identifiers. Any test runner uses identifiers to control the application. And, you can also use identifiers to validate outputs. So, a consistent regime to create identifiers helps you deliver consistency. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you lack identifiers, you get stuck with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS Selectors</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xpath selectors</a>. Those can get messy – especially over time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another way to make your app testable, Angie says, requires code that lets your test set initial conditions. If your UI tests depend on certain data values, then you need code to set those values prior to running those tests. Your developers need to create that code – via API or stored procedure – to ensure that the tests always begin with the proper conditions. This setup code can help you create the parallel tests that help your tests run more quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also use code to restore conditions after your tests run – leaving the app in the proper state for another test.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Quantity</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, Angie said, you need to consider the number of tests you run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-zQAxwDPmDF7YZ-0L0nPSutRXOTpp8KmfSBEfyUq8YGYQ0zN52ssAsZY506s6JjoXqvus7fsVhjQ2YRWRbty_T4VtUckg9BqesFLv_QIVw0fimLflnFYAwfZRumdVCqAP53BFMZF" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a common misconception that you need to automate every possible test condition you can think about, she said. People get into trouble trying to do this in practice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, lots of tests increase your test time. And, as Angie said already, you don’t want longer test times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, you end up with low value as well as high-value UI tests.  Angie asks a question to help triage her tests:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Which test would I want to stop an integration or deployment? If I don’t want this test to stop a deployment, it doesn’t get automated. Or maybe it’s automated, but it’s run like once a day on some other cycle, not on my CICD.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Angie also asks about the value of the functionality:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Which test exercises critical, core functionality? Those are the ones you want in there. Which tests cover areas of my application that have a history of failing? You’re nervous anytime you have to touch that code. You want some tests around that area, too.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lastly, Angie asks, which tests provide information already covered by other tests in the pipeline? So many people forget to think about total coverage. They create repetitive tests and leave them in the pipeline. And, as many developers know, a single check-in that triggers multiple failures can do so because it was a single code error that had been tested, and failed, multiple times. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Don’t be afraid to delete tests,” Angie said. If it’s redundant, get rid of it, and reduce your overall test code maintenance. She talked about how long it took her to become comfortable with deleting tests, but she appreciates the exercise now. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Maintenance</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Test code is code,” Angie said. “You need to write it with the same rules, the same guidelines, the same care that you would any production code.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wBl_K8ycuanWHrNs_nFMYEPoq3F-HOZpEFTf-eB4hbhNj8-fWv_bjMtpZ7B5R_MKX4JALv4QRhX_IyDIgW6zrIZ31E3m-CDvh5uvR-clGBlbfUmOwAeI4gN1lsWTS57a4_Ty2yqX" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Angie continued, saying that people ask, “‘Well, Angie, why do I need to be so rigorous with my test code?’”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Angie made the point that test code monitors production code. In your CICD development, the state of the build depends on test acceptance. If you build sloppy test code, you run the risk of false positives and false negatives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As your production code changes, your test code must change as well. The sloppier your test code, the more difficult time you will have in test maintenance. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Writing test code with the same care as you write production gives you the best chance to keep your CICD pipeline in fast, consistent delivery. Alternatively, Angie said, if your test code stays a mess, you will have a tendency to avoid code maintenance. Avoiding maintenance will lead to untrustworthy builds. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Writing UI Tests – Introduction</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, Angie introduced the application she and Jessica were using for their coding demonstration. The app – a chat app, looks like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uEIVnL-C3zn02X_PkMPLqIqrShsbaU8ZN5Kz43ZjoiffGlLMLEOpCo1q5qzalHqyEvUnFp6iolciVhk-bz7HooKQlTEidTCkWONPb_3ZrGbnjcmhXUmVf5kvzAjSuHFA-UrLaDAn" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The welcome screen asks you to enter your username and click “Start Chatting” – the red button. Once you have done so, you’re in the app. Going forward, you enter text and click the “Send” button and it shows up on a chat screen along with your username. Other users can do the same thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mQIupEbZ-FPZ0ltImm8MaSq-E67Rn5MATKAx0RZOwPd08pPBAblryeT9tAkHfsv3sl1tX9u2nMs0ynNcgvufbzcmpabqM1Pl4gb8CKxCGMbqs4KiOPSakIc8TkqKxdaQXKiJ-jdi" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this as a starting point, Angie and Jessica began the process of test writing. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Writing UI Tests – Coding Tests</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Angie and Jessica were on a LiveShare of code, which looked like this:</p>

<p>From here, Angie started building her UI tests for the sign-in functionality. And, because she likes to code in Java, she coded in Java. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the objects she used were identified in the BaseTests class she inherited.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her full code to sign-in looked like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">public class ChattyBotTests extends BaseTests {
  private ChatPage chatPage:

  @Test
  public void newSession(){
     driver.get(appUrl);
     homePage.enterUsername("angie");
     chatPage = homePage.clickStartChatting();
     validateWindow();
  }</pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The test code gest the URL previously defined in the BaseTests class, fills in the username box with “angie”, and clicks the “Start Chatting” button. Finally, Angie added the validateWindow() method inherited from BaseTests, which uses Applitools visual testing to validate the new screen after the Start Chatting button has been clicked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, Angie wrote the code to enter a message, click send message, and validate that the message was on the screen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">  @Test
  public void enterMessage(){
     chatPage.sendMessage("hello world");
     validateWindow():
 }</pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The inherited chatPage.sendMessage method both enters the text and clicks the Send Message button. validateWindow() again checks the screen using Applitools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Are these usable as-is for CICD? Nope.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Coding Pre-Test Setup</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If we want to run tests in parallel, these tests, as written, block parallel operation, since the enterMessage() depends on the newSession() being run previously.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So solve this, Angie creates a pre-test startSession() that runs before all tests. It includes the first three lines of newSession() which go to the app URL, enter “angie” as the username, and click the “Start Chatting” button. Next, Angie modifies her newSession() test so all it does is the validation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">  @Before
  public void startSession(){
     driver.get(appUrl);
     homePage.enterUsername("angie");
     chatPage = homePage.clickStartChatting();
  }

  @Test
  public void newSession(){
     validateWindow();
 }</pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this @Before setup, Angie can create independent tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Adding Multi-User Test</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, Angie added a multi-user test. In this test, she assumed the @Before gest run, and her new test looked like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">  @Test
  public void multiPersonChat(){

     //Angie sends a message
     chatPage.sendMessage(“hello world”);

     //Jessica sends a message
     WindowUtils.openNewTab(driver, appUrl);
     homePage.enterUsername("jessica");
     chatPage = homePage.clickStartChatting();
     chatPage.sendMessage("goodbye world");
     WindowUtils.switchToTab(driver, 1);
     validateWindow();
  }</pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here, user “angie” sends the message “hello world”. Then, Angie codes the browser to:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>open a new tab for the app URL, </li><li>create a new chat session for “jessica”</li><li>has “jessica” send the message “goodbye world”</li><li>Switch back to the original tab</li><li>Validate the window</li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:heading --><h2>Integrating UI Tests Into CICD</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, it was Jessica’s turn to control the code. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before she got started coding, Jessica shared her screen from <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code</a>, to demonstrate the LiveShare feature of VS Code:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ksilew2NaXI3-iLuClI-YGf5j4Ca63G1foBVzoV72hUGfVPT7hYOxmFOcYWOQHcoojV0j6g96p2-f7KnalLPaP9rL6zNQPpdz3DmwiVeMwJ-dwqB6BKIN2qBAyboZWBnbwSvDwX1" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Angie and Jessica were working on the same file using <a target="_blank" href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/" rel="noopener noreferrer">LiveShare</a>. LiveShare highlights Angie’s cursor on Jessica’s screen. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Angie selects a block of text, the text gets highlighted on Jessica’s screen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/GzLOHjEjKTopCFwFFYsMV4Vn9GX5Fqd_n7pEx87OehkYAXldE_Z1WySDzFlEj4_jJZQtiX4A5LiFapn0KrSmHJrDqNM2ZI96iJuDBwdmYFpeHYsJ1PdZYV3-P--mYNa1sVnuv_tN" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This extension to Visual Studio Code makes it easy to collaborate on coding projects remotely. It’s available for download on the <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code Marketplace</a>. It’s great for pair programming when compared with remote screen share.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To begin the discussion of using these tests in CICD, Jessica started describing the environment for running the tests from a developer perspective versus a CICD perspective. A developer might imagine running locally, with IntelliJ or command line opening up browser windows. In contrast, CICD needs to run unattended.  So, we need to consider headless.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jessica showed how she coded for different environments in which she might run her tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/0PiQxmYNv5Q2NOrKZRobmNQ1f3iIkGGdUdjIKHHJ8yIzZGfJWbZUFMY8iJJKuxIzyYdE1nvMDIucSiZQ-HsLo_5K3-e9qYIJ-yzsg-oSyL-W6ylcT5TerFNe4EUQxd1uGDyXRtHA" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her code explains that the environment gets defined by a variable called runWhere, which can equal one of three values:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>local – uses a ChromeDriver</li><li>pipeline – uses a dedicated build server and sets the options –headless and –no-sandbox for ChromeDriver (note: for Windows you add the option “–disable-gui”)</li><li>container – instructs the driver to be a remote web driver based on the selenium hub remote URL and passes the –headless and –no-sandbox chromeOptions</li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --><h3>Testing Locally</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, Jessica needed to verify that the testa ran using the local settings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jessica set the RUNWHERE variable to ‘local’ using the command</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">export RUNWHERE=local</pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She had already exported other settings, such as her Applitools API Key, so she can use Applitools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since Jessica was already in her visual test folder, she run her standard maven command:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">mvn -f visual_tests/pom.xml clean test</pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tests ran as expected with no errors. The test opened up a local browser window and she showed the tests running.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Testing Pipeline</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, Jessica set up to test her pipeline environment settings. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She changed the RUNWHERE variable using the command:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">export RUNWHERE=pipeline</pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, she executed the same maven tests</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">mvn -f visual_tests/pom.xml clean test</pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the expectation that the tests would run as expected using her pipeline server, meaning that the tests run without opening a browser window on her local machine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is important because whatever CICD pipeline you use – Azure DevOps, Github Actions, Travis CI, or any traditional non-container-based CICD system – will want to use this headless interaction with the browser that keeps the GUI from opening up and possibly throwing an error.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once these passed, Jessica moved on to testing with containers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Testing Containers</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking back, the container-based tests used a call to RemoteWebDriver, which in turns called selenium_hub:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iQLtLIG4ydmIpX0kqYrSLCQxBDIAoOkgLffPtECaDqMvmo0vcVxckK_yOIkHSp8IW0VNp17LTmG561Bl4jtqgULXcj5jdyuSBdMWdA2ZgBWri1pJ7MLG2ND0kytUGo7ubLr9BJRQ" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Selenium_hub let Jessica spin up whatever browser she wanted.  To specify what she wanted, she used a docker-compose file, docker-compose.yaml:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/iUOSbCs9K1SsKIUvHdsK89HdrL3nuKsuIIiOmSTfWzoQrldCDefXvSIcZuFCQqdP1spKKuuJ_GD1_QtBqhjO79-zaSVvU1J2UedfomOeZAGOZOScxZgdBUOz_wKNqCBxHvTT1v41" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These container-based approaches align with the current use of cloud-native pipelines for CICD. Jessica noted you can use <a target="_blank" href="https://jenkins.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenkins</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://jenkins-x.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenkins X</a> for <a target="_blank" href="https://kubernetes.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes</a> native, and <a target="_blank" href="https://codefresh.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">CodeFresh</a>, among others. Jessica decided to show CodeFresh. It’s a CICD pipeline dedicated to Kubernetes and microservices.  Every task runs in a container.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Selenium_Hub let Jessica choose to run tests on both a chorme_node and a firefox_node in her container setup.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She simply needed to modify her RUNWHERE variable</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">export RUNWHERE=container</pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, before running her tests, she needed to spin up her <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/" rel="noopener noreferrer">docker-compose</a> on her local system. And, because selenium_hub wasn’t something that her system could identify by DNS at that moment (it was running on her local system), she ensured that the selenium_hub running locally would port forward onto her local system’s 127.0.0.1 connection. Once she made these changes, and changed the container definition to use 127.0.0.1:4444, she was ready to run her maven pom.xml file.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the tests ran successfully, her local validation confirmed that her tests should run in her pipeline of choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jessica pointed out that CICD really comes down to a collection of tasks you would run manually.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that, Jessica said, we need to automate those tasks in a definition file. Typically, that’s Yaml, unless you really like pain and choose <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-cps/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Groovy</a> in Jenkins… (no judgement, she said).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Looking at Azure DevOps</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, Jessica did a quick look into Azure DevOps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/k16t37L5YvppbzZa6qX1S8BM3LGRWRhrZ-C8TEg994XssOxdbpbM-TCscIEQOqOMtnSVZ6V5lt61009FiRFbwhSAHFLDjoIi5CzQgNbCvZDqMGXkjUe8dJKYZJhqtNvsTWFeNOY9" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inside Azure DevOps, Jessica showed that she had a number of pipelines already written, and she chose the one she had set aside for the project. This pipeline already had three separate stages: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Build Stage</li><li>Deploy to Dev</li><li>Deploy to Prod</li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} --><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VJG9z1r0mflKFqXmZ4TTvO0BVp2AUGfriP2OuUCRyWgPW_dyjYqwuD4waeyu-Qw7PXVXAhCajgpjKXWcj_90XIKNz0BqZzWTy6bgyPPVwD-aV59-htBYnvDuRfvJFEi8hmk22bne" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opening up the build stage shows all the steps contained just within that stage in its 74 seconds of runtime:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/npDg3ZdVdnoUPlJOzaaktZ1H2kzdkC57dbk6xaI64oZNofcDUXu5BTTIHPyx1SSKze8ZCvjRa4Y6NxG5bu3cBv6PkjtVt6C9VcBsI6bPxgRduYABmSPEWIfNxJU4ZunOhqxAM91J" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jessica pointed out that this little ChattyBot application is running on a large cluster in Azure. It’s running in Kubernetes, and it’s deployed with <a target="_blank" href="https://helm.sh/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helm</a>.  The whole build stage includes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>using <a target="_blank" href="https://jfrog.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">JFrog</a> to package up all the maven dependencies and run the maven build</li><li>jfrog xray to make sure that the dependencies don’t result in security errors, </li><li>Creating a helm chart and packaging that,</li><li>Sending <a target="_blank" href="https://slack.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a> notifications</li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This is a pretty extensive pipeline. Jessica wondered how hard it would be to integrate Angie’s tests into an existing environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, because of the work Jessica had done to make Angie’s tests ready for CICD, it was really easy to add those tests into the deploy workflow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, Jessica reviewed the Deploy to Dev stage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FBv-bpfXSpvxh7RNkXBP10WWEeS6mlztLma0QUkdfmGoNGZz4uI_kuOZoeK_U7oH8rsJVTuj78-utWoPaWGufaiozbRMzCMmGj21o__033ei5hk8SLmSgJ55NpQz_vL3w42V0TDM" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Adding UI Tests in Your CICD Pipeline</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, Jessica started doing the work to add Angie’s tests into her existing CICD pipeline. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the RUNWHERE=container tests finished successfully, Jessica went back into VS Code, where she started inspecting her azure-pipelines.yml file.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jessica made it clear that she wanted to add the tests everywhere that it made sense prior to promoting code to production:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Jessica reinforced Angie’s earlier points – these UI tests were critical and needed to pass. So, in order to include them in her pipeline, she needed to add them in an order that makes sense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In her Deploy to Dev pipeline, she added the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">   - bash:<br/>     # run check to see when $(hostname) is available<br/>     attempt_counter=0<br/>     max_attempts=5<br/>     until $(curl --output /dev/null --silent --head --fail https://”$(hostname)”/); do<br/>       if [ ${attempt_counter} -eq ${max_attempts} ]; then<br/>         echo “Max attempts reached”<br/>         exit 1<br/>       fi<p>       printf “.”<br/>       attempt_counter=$((attempt_counter+1))<br/>       sleep 20<br/>     done<br/>   displayName: HTTP Check</p></pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This script checks to see if the url $hostname is available and gives up if not available after five tries after sleeping 20 seconds. Each try it displays a “.” to show it is working. And, the name “HTTP Check” shows what it is doing. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, to add the tests, Jessica needed to capture the environment variable declarations and then run the maven commands.  And, as Jessica pointed out, this is where things can become challenging, especially when writing the tests from scratch, because people may not know the syntax.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Editing the azure-pipelines.yml in Azure DevOps</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, Jessica moved back from Visual Studio Code to Azure DevOps, where she could also edit an azure-pipelines.yml file directly in the browser.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Z6JpIe6UI7W7PQlph4HthN_LPCkhKL9IFIEQsjmT5-X7eu7dGkNzFvwWzE8Tii7RsTeJjZKdhDwcvBUqlMbXRVOT5Qai6Dtr0Kqm5knxCfdqpLybzuxurQv9QsnDekWCJ4YpfNR4" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, here, on the right side of her screen (I captured it separately) are tasks she can add to her pipeline. The ability to add tasks makes this process really, really simple and eliminates a lot of the errors that can happen when you code by hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of those tasks is an Applitools Build Task that she was able to add by installing an extension.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/juwEVyxc6glbr2KQ3Uu8wPlA0R73WSG1URr0E6O6d1NJduwhkWjHSnNfyAhye-1zlBScvvAUiiUu09Nww7YUnGdyGvemHbcCpSR0Cq07ltdaXKzIJkS82lZ-Nusd1shIIFB1n5j9" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just clicking on this Applitools Build Task adds it to the azure_pipelines.yml file.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, now Jessica wanted to add her maven build task – but instead of doing a bash script, she wanted to use the maven task in Azure DevOps. Finding the task and clicking on it shows all the options for the task.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/mimL_govjqGBcUYh2Ht-0ijVtshgKkRMfxPq8wQXOLwMXNOMN6nKoRuF1KUgzq_jL0xsSTuckdj3bixtNh3kAloIpoKgrJDV_ko0l4OtWsyj62XBm9QcLbo831AFOCkfiqKWJ561" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The values are all defaults. Jessica changed the address for her pom.xml file to visual_tests/pom.xml (the file location for the test file), set her goal as ‘test’ and options as ‘clean test’. She checked everything else, and since it looked okay, she clicked the “Add” button.  The following code got added to her azure-pipelines.yml file.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">  - task: Maven<br/>     inputs: <br/>       mavenPomFile: ‘visual_tests/pom.xml’<br/>       goals: 'test'<br/>       options: 'clean test'<br/>       publishJUnitResults: true<br/>       testResultsFiles: '**/surefire-report/TEST-*.xml'<br/>       javaHomeOption: 'JDKVersion'<br/>       mavenVersionOption: 'Default'<br/>       mavenAuthenticationFeed: false<br/>       effectivePomSkip: false<br/>       sonarQubeRunAnalysis: false</pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Going Back To The Test Code</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jessica copied the Applitools Built Task and Maven task code file back into the azure-pipelines.yml file she was already editing in Visual Studio Code.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Zal_s2cr6EVtqLiktwOJOKpTA2IQ5w9V7DSSsnUET6PNxid0cACjgpSfGlWjqpcKM6Bn0AmSXcxvZgnPaI1pqLn7C-2n6xjEHmwQPknSRWjf33CU9kExTeDNdIiuNmOWtiFiaZGp" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, she added the environment variables needed to run the tests.  This included the Applitools API Key, which is a secret value from Applitools. In this case, Jessica defined this variable in Azure DevOps and could call it by the variable name.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/UzI3y8AxVsrQtEchoYu-EMLhMcUj7QGu_JgX7kCqwMWcEt6XlJ1KIKgXisLb22qnYsgy28_ui7Fi1nYzxBZ-ho0AhL8FOErstYqO2VBa86jezI1XtfveF82GtLxEVsq33MEFGTWc" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beyond the Applitools API Key, Jessica also set the RUNWHERE environment variable to ‘pipeline’ and the TEST_START_PAGE environment variable to the $hostname – same as used elsewhere in her code. All this made her tests dynamic.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The added code reads:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">     env: <br/>       APPLITOOLSAPIKEY: $APPLITOOLS_API_KEY<br/>       RUNWHERE: pipeline<br/>       TEST_START_PAGE: https://($hostname)/</pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, now, the tests are ready to commit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One thing Jessica noted is that LiveShare automatically adds the co-author’s id to the commit whenever two people have jointly worked on code. It’s a cool feature of LiveShare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Verifying That UI Tests Work In CICD</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, now that the pipeline code had been added, Jessica wanted to demonstrate that the visual validation with Applitools worked as expected and found visual differences.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jessica modified the ChattyBot application so that, instead of reading:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center">“Hello, DevOps Days Madrid 2020!!!”</p>

<p>She saved the change, double-checked the test code, saw that everything looked right, and pushed the commit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This kicked off a new build in Azure DevOps. Jessica showed the build underway. She said that, with the visual difference, we expect the Deploy to Dev pipeline to fail. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since we had time to wait, she showed what happened on an earlier build that she had done just before the webinar. During that build, the Deploy to Dev passed. She was able to show how Azure DevOps seamlessly linked the Applitools dashboard – and, assuming you were logged in, you would see the dashboard screen just by clicking on the Applitools tab.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zHXOg8DmvBodEPKIHG8V1_1076u6lwMMmZIb8WPFKxPgGbmeaZcriTx7C3KTmuiUigohu66-D8e1zGkhVs-KAq6TJuxvbP8t7tQvnXNOHBQRlbnG3fkoBUJ_aNzWhUfNUqJNaiJ9" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here, the green boxes on the Status column show that the tests passed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jessica drilled into the enterMessage test to show how the baseline and the new checkpoint compared (even though the comparison passed), just to show the Applitools UI.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OTiDitCfMWk6I1KXRb-xeD9q2_O4T_ghVAfGjkbnJMExqCfoqrWEoD26TEqblxUGIE44NF19-uHb159uh5hbMHRE5-D8DwVcsnpzSfkCsXe_sOS0mdLXEpEEgdYvy7Q8hVnqLBCq" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As Jessica said, were any part of this test to be visually different due to color, sizing, text, or any other visual artifact, she could select the region and give it a thumbs-up to approve it as a change (and cause the test to pass), or give it a thumbs-down and inform the dev team of the unexpected difference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, she has all this information from within her Azure DevOps build.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What If I Don’t Use Azure DevOps?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jessica said she gets this question all the time, because not everyone uses AzureDevOps.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You could be using Azure DevOps, TeamCity CI, Octopus Deploy, Jenkins – it doesn’t matter. You’re still going to be organizing tasks that make sense.  You will need to run an HTTP check to make sure your site is up and running.  You will need to make sure you have access to your environment variables. And, then, finally, you will need to run your maven command-line test.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jessica jumped into Github Actions, where she had an existing pipeline, and she showed that her deploy step looked identical.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hR9arl4FtC8KO0mE7mF7nYA8X1lGKzcKpnXKgL-fFM4w2kw8oGA-c4RDecwS69Y7D5crU2VLl81CnvhFGuDcDJeO-_8ZfCezX6Z0a2aU2_2UM7SujV8EwSkbmBNiOda91wJxwTWd" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It had an http check, an Applitools Build Task, and a call for Visual Testing. The only difference was that the Applitools Build Task included several lines of bash to export Applitools environment variables.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The one extra step she added, just as a sanity check, was to set the JDK version.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, while she was in Github Actions, she referred back to the container scenario. She noted the challenges with spinning up Docker Compose and services.  For this reason, when looking at container tests, she pointed to CodeFresh, which is Kubernetes-native.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inside her CodeFresh pipelines, everything runs in a container.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7-q1HbV2U03JAuek9yCBxi1Zad3d7_W_gBSeXRbBB3FqjpwEnlOs-811JJYDeLyZ31s4yeqdmArKMvywZJIhisR3ssy_1bryptK5bOVtJ6mnJTItaBvoU7ru7xz0Rzz0p7W_JFka" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As she pointed out, by running on CodeFresh, she didn’t need a huge server to handle everything. Each container handled just what it needed to handle. Spinning up Docker Compose just requires docker. She needed just jFrog for her Artifactory image. Helm lint – again, just what she needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The image above shows the pipelines before adding the visual tests. The below image shows the Deploy Dev pipeline with the same three additions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-c2O2PggxfLDI6qXCAoTZXm0zT2ETwUx8seMCU2zBOiYxASVZbE4Yb-rrgUV66mOpvnBgblzbOmMH33XMk4LAoy5S9iv2ytHEn8fQhUWWvcFIiuZ3HlKhAaEtr1RCXobdERUq0_e" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s the HTTP check, the Applitools Build Task, and Running Visual Tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only difference really is that the visual tests ran alongside services that were spinning up alongside the test.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is really easy to do in your codefresh.yml file, and the syntax looks a lot like Docker Compose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Seeing the Visual Failure</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back in Azure DevOps, Jessica checked in on her Deploy to Dev step.  She already knew there was a problem from her Slack notifications.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WL1_T8n7D5KeXdxxMfvH5QzGQvkylPIaKjdnosMTpfw_CmwVFMc_96eZO3c2w1KpI2BiOxHeRt_ptFOYnn5yksy2q-Ls3e0QB4TU69m5UhPoGv_rvRtszhGtHGnb4GZNRSS5MuiL" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The error report showed that the visual tests all failed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clicking on the Applitools tab, she saw the following.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7wHuzslxH9AXyC9FkW9Dhy-CuEnzq-BV3ueXdH0q6Gqv0Vdl6mFaowZnXd8gRTvmrNKT5tTbTBjWIAUQwB2R2fXU7iLJjfNkmpXqZ-_lXII7jfYRd5Ss3QFvpVnZ89I-js83b4zI" alt=""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All three tests showed as unresolved.  Clicking in to the multiPersonChat test, Jessica saw this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/s978uBHMiCe-qHvpIBg9fhQWQ0XKHjy1_-YWFQIxY9sMfosBpt4NwbkzzsstGTjhqdkkFD6uTgOSuytAi08ol7eo3abIf7nlvqHaEP2c9TBtzD9XFhuIcbeO7gIECs7X2_sLbut8" alt=""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Sure enough, the text change from “Hello, DevOps Days Madrid 2020!!!” to “Hello, awesome webinar attendees!” caused a difference. We totally expected this difference, and we would find that this difference had also shown up in the other tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The change may not have been a behavioral change expected in your tests, so you may or may not have thought to test for the “Hello…” text or check for its modification. Applitools makes it easy to capture any visual difference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jessica didn’t go through this, but one feature in Applitools is the ability to use Auto Maintenance. With Auto Maintenance, if Jessica had approved the change on this first page, she could automatically approve identical changes on other pages. So, if this was an intended change, it would go from “Unresolved” to “Passed” on all the pages where the change had been observed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Summing Up</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jessica handed back presentation to Angie, who shared Jessica’s link for code from the webinar:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The last decade saw a transformational move to public cloud infrastructures for most large enterprises, and today many companies run their critical business processes and applications on <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/hybrid-multicloud-management-tb/multi-cloud-platforms?lx=ooPdGt&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">a mix of cloud infrastructures </a>and supporting services.</p>
<p>In fact, 94% of large enterprises now use cloud services, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.flexera.com/web/media/documents/rightscale-2019-state-of-the-cloud-report-from-flexera.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Flexera&#8217;s &#8220;RightScale 2019 State of the Cloud&#8221;</a> report. But CIOs are now taking a more measured approach to cloud cost containment and optimization, as wholesale moves to the cloud have proved to be more costly than expected.</p>
<p>Enterprise IT leaders need to take a <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/hybrid-multicloud-management-tb/manage-cloud-complexity?lx=ooPdGt&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">strategic view of their cloud environments</a> and service footprints to better determine <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-avoid-hidden-costs-other-cloud-gotchas" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to manage their cloud spending</a>, now and for the future. </p>
<p><em>[ Get up to speed on <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/it-operations-monitoring-tb?utm_campaign=00134846&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_source=techbeacon" rel="noopener noreferrer">IT Operations Monitoring with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide</a>.

<h2>Why it&#8217;s difficult to forecast cloud costs</h2>
<p>Enterprise IT budgets have swelled in recent years. The most recent expected enterprise IT budget increase is 18% year over year, according to a Spiceworks survey, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.spiceworks.com/marketing/state-of-it/report" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The 2020 State of IT: The Annual Report on IT Budgets and Tech Trends</a>.&#8221; </p>
<p>There is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2018/02/15/too-much-corporate-money-is-evaporating-into-the-cloud-survey-suggests" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a perception among IT executives</a> that cloud costs are outpacing their budget allocations and ultimately spiraling out of control. Many organizations that have moved applications and workloads to the cloud have done so with haste, overlooking <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-match-your-it-workloads-right-cloud" rel="noopener noreferrer">the finer points of cloud cost provisioning</a>.</p>
<p>The frenzied push to convert CAPEX into OPEX results in poorly forecast costs, and, without adequate cost containment strategies, cloud services costs often spin out of control.</p>
<p>In general, organizations tend to neglect the soft costs of doing business, and this is also true when moving to the cloud. Enterprise IT teams regularly discount the length of time and the degree of change management required for a successful cloud migration.</p>
<p>IT teams often lack an adequate understanding of the downstream implications of a cloud migration, including but not limited to the skills required to be successful, new risks, and additional compliance reporting requirements.</p>
<h3>The move to multicloud and other complexities</h3>
<p>Many enterprises are <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/hybrid-multicloud-management-tb/architect-manage-hybrid-multiclouds?lx=ooPdGt&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">moving from single- to multicloud environments</a>. Some 84% of enterprises are using multiple public clouds, and enterprises with a hybrid strategy are above 50% and growing, according to the &#8220;State of the Cloud&#8221; survey.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, only about 50% of enterprises are using cloud management platforms, <a target="_blank" href="https://diamanti.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/451Perspective_A-cloud-feast-heralds-the-era-of-consumption-Part-1.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">according to 451 Research</a>. And enterprises without a cloud management platform can expect poor visibility into their cloud environments, which can lead to runaway workload costs.</p>
<p>Another issue around cloud deployment is communication problems among different teams. In an article titled &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/devops-dictates-new-approach-cloud-development" rel="noopener noreferrer">DevOps dictates new approach to cloud development</a>,&#8221; David Linthicum of Deloitte Consulting described the situation well: &#8220;What&#8217;s most interesting is that the cloud isn&#8217;t really driving DevOps; rather, DevOps is driving the interest and the growth of cloud.&#8221; The conclusion is &#8220;DevOps is wagging the cloud computing dog, not the other way around.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, if a quality assurance (QA) team provisions cloud resources for internal testing, but those resources remain active when not being used, that&#8217;s a problem. <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/7-leadership-skills-will-make-or-break-your-devops-transformation" rel="noopener noreferrer">Without effective communication</a>, the DevOps team may deprovision those cloud resources when the QA team needs them, leading to frustration and bottlenecks.</p>

<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
<p>Although it&#8217;s true that IT execs perceive that cloud costs are spiraling out of control, the reason the situation has arisen isn&#8217;t because the underlying service costs are increasing. The absolute costs of computation, information transfer, and data storage (per unit of measurement) fell exponentially for nearly all of the 20th century; this situation has continued into the present.</p>
<p>This is thanks to the economic phenomenon of experience curves captured in Moore&#8217;s Law and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jackmwilson.net/Entrepreneurship/Cases/Moores-Meltcalfes-Gilders-Law.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the lesser-known but related laws of Gilder and Metcalf</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/wireless/edholms-law-of-bandwidth" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Edholm</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.flydata.com/blog/moores-law-kryders-law" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kryder</a>.</p>
<p>So, contrary to popular belief, cloud costs are not rising in absolute terms. Don&#8217;t fall for that. Instead, CIOs should be asking the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which factors are driving up my costs?</li>
<li>How can we navigate the cost optimization journey?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cloud cost optimization best practices</h3>
<p>Enterprises should take these three steps to more effectively manage their cloud services.</p>
<h4>Move workloads and applications to the cloud on a piecemeal basis</h4>
<p>Consider doubling down on pilot projects to better ascertain the true costs of cloud services. When done right (small-scale, objective measures of success), pilots and a proof of concept (PoC) can reduce downstream costs by allowing your organization to traverse the learning curve with lower risk, turning those &#8220;unknown unknowns&#8221; into &#8220;known unknowns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if your enterprise has already gone down the path of cloud adoption, doing pilot projects and PoCs can prevent additional unexpected cost proliferation.</p>
<h4>Implement cost optimization and governance tools </h4>
<p>Ensuring visibility into the cloud environment is a principal lever in reining in costs. Moreover, establishing governance controls is critical to ensuring that cloud infrastructure policies are defined and enforced.</p>
<p>Many cost optimization tools have some built-in governance capabilities. Unfortunately, there’s no silver bullet—no single tool currently covers everything well. The recommended approach is to select a cost optimization tool in combination with a governance and security tool. This is also where <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/how-automation-can-boost-your-security-compliance" rel="noopener noreferrer">policy automation comes into play</a>. </p>
<p>The related challenge is deciding which group within an enterprise should select and implement these tools. This is typically a tug of war between finance and IT. There is an inherent tension between those teams in most organizations, and they have difficulty finding common ground. Which path an organization takes depends on the use cases being addressed and how the organization is structured.</p>
<h4>Improve communications</h4>
<p>Finally, develop rules and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/4-essential-soft-skills-every-devops-team-needs" rel="noopener noreferrer">communication processes with your DevOps team</a>. DevOps teams inadvertently drive cloud services costs, so having effective cross-team operating and communication mechanisms is critical to ensure the right work is getting done without breaking the bank.</p>
<h2>Having a cloud strategy is key to success</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/software-ultimate-currency-why-containers-serverless-should-be-your-go" rel="noopener noreferrer">Containerization and serverless computing</a> will be significant drivers of public cloud growth in the next few years. To take advantage of these emerging trends in cost-effective ways, IT leaders must tackle the basics of cloud cost optimization and governance now. These issues are increasingly becoming as important as addressing the cybersecurity challenge faced by enterprises.</p>
<p>To adequately address the challenge of cloud cost optimization, your organization may need to adopt multiple, complementary tools and governance processes, which is why first defining your cloud strategy is key.</p>
<p>Given the number of vendors in cloud cost optimization and governance, IT leaders should focus on mapping out a cloud strategy for specific use cases. This includes identifying solutions that address your organization&#8217;s specific use cases and then selecting two to three vendors for a deeper comparative dive and PoC.</p>
<p>In the absence of an effective cloud strategy, cloud costs will continue to rise. It&#8217;s up to enterprises, their CIOs, and their strategic technology partners to rein in those costs, and to do so in a way that doesn&#8217;t stymie innovation or digital transformation initiatives.</p>
