										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>Can you double or triple the speed of your test runs by switching out a few lines of code?</p>
<p>That’s what the team at Applitools is promising.</p>
<p>They’ve challenged test automation teams to speed up their test suites with their new Ultra-Fast Grid (UFG), which provides “massively parallel test automation across all browsers, devices, and viewports.”</p>
<p>To try it out myself, I took part of their Cross Browser Testing Hackathon, seeing if their new grid lived up to its claims.</p>
<h2 id="whatsthecrossbrowsertestinghackathon">What’s the Cross Browser Testing Hackathon?</h2>
<p>In June of this year (2020), Applitools held an online Cross Browser Testing Hackathon. The challenge was to complete three automation tasks, attempting to catch bugs between two versions of the same app, using two different techniques.</p>
<p>While I really wanted to participate in it, I also needed to focus my efforts on my book, <a target="_blank" href="https://leanpub.com/webapp-testing-guidebook" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Web App Testing Guidebook</a>. As much as I wanted to, I just didn’t have to the time to commit to the hackathon.</p>
<p>So it came and went and I moved on with life. A few months later, Applitools reached out and asked if I’d be interested in covering the content via a series of live streams, plus this blog post. I thought the opportunity was a great fit, since I already had an interest in the topic, plus the work on my book had mostly wrapped up.</p>
<p>At this point, I should mention that Applitools is sponsoring all of this. I do my best to stay objective, but I want to be transparent with that.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote">
<blockquote>
<p>“…with the UFG, you run your test setup scripts… once on your local machine, then the Applitools code takes a snapshot of the page HTML &amp; CSS and sends it to the grid for processing. This means that we can run our filtering steps in the desktop view, yet still be able to capture our screenshots in mobile view via Applitools.</p>
<p><cite>–Kevin Lamping</cite></p></blockquote>
</figure>
<p>I should also mention what Applitools does. They are a “Next generation test automation platform powered by Visual AI”. I’m a big fan of Visual Regression Testing, seeing that I help maintain <a target="_blank" href="https://visualregressiontesting.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">visualregressiontesting.com</a> and have covered the approach many, many times since <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE_19L0l2q0" rel="noopener noreferrer">I first came across it</a> back in 2013.</p>
<p>Applitools takes the Visual Regression Testing approach to a new level, which I talk about in my blog post “<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.kevinlamping.com/visual-regression-testing-is-stupid/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Regression Testing is Stupid</a>.”</p>
<p>The reason that Applitools put on the hackathon was to get people to try out their new “Ultra-Fast Grid”. Rather than try and describe what that is myself, I’ll use their own words: “With Ultrafast Grid, you run your functional &amp; visual tests once locally and it instantly renders all screens across all combinations of browsers, devices, and viewports. This is all done with unprecedented security, stability, and speed, and with virtually no setup required.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

</p>
</figure>
<p>We’ll get to my thoughts on the UFG (Ultra-Fast Grid) in a bit, but let’s cover what the Hackathon entailed first. Here’s how <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/cross-browser-testing-hackathon-v20-1-instructions-internal/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the project page</a> introduces the challenge:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Imagine you are a test automation engineer for “AppliFashion”, a high profile e-commerce company that sells fancy shoes. The AppliFashion web app is used by millions of people, using various devices and browsers to buy shoes. The 1st version of the app (V1) is already built and is “bug-free”. Your developers are now coming up with a newer version, version (V2) of the app, and assume that it’s full of bugs.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>The challenge is to build the automation suite for the first version of the app and use it to find bugs in the second version (V2) of the app. You need to automate three (3) main tasks across seven (7) different combinations of browsers and screen resolutions (viewports). Further, you need to automate the tasks in both the traditional approach and the Modern approach through Visual AI, for both V1 and V2 versions of the app. By “traditional approach”, we mean without using Applitools Visual AI. You can execute the traditional tests either locally or by using other cross-browser cloud solutions that you are already familiar with.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a pretty realistic scenario in my mind. That’s one of the things I really appreciated about this entire challenge; the scenarios were very “real world”. They took the time to create a project that reflected what you may face in a work-related project. I think that’s a testament to how valuable Visual Regression Testing can be.</p>
<h2 id="howididit">How I Did It</h2>
<p>Over a series of three 2-hour live streams, I worked through the three tasks assigned to the project (completing one task each stream).</p>
<p>As for tooling, I’m a huge fan of <a target="_blank" href="https://webdriver.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebdriverIO</a>. I used it, plus <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@applitools/eyes-webdriverio" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Applitools WebdriverIO SDK</a>, for my test framework. I also used Sauce Labs for my traditional cross-browser testing needs.</p>
<p>You can find a copy of the final code here:<br /><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/klamping/applitools-hackathon-2020" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/klamping/applitools-hackathon-2020</a></p>
<p>Now let’s talk through each task. For the sake of brevity, I’ll be going through a high-level overview of each task, what I did, and my impressions comparing “traditional” testing vs. the Applitools “modern” approach.</p>
<h3 id="task1crossdeviceelementstest">Task 1 – Cross-Device Elements Test</h3>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">
<p>
<iframe title="Comparing Cross-browser Testing Techniques (Part 1 of 3) - Live Stream" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kViTmxBWGjo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p><figcaption>Video Replay of Stream #1</figcaption></figure>
<p>The challenge started off with a relatively simple set of tests. The test would compose of loading the homepage, then validating the correct elements appear (or don’t) on the page.</p>
<p>Most of my time was spent on getting my project initialized and set up. I’m fairly familiar with WebdriverIO, so installation and configuration went pretty smoothly.</p>
<p>One challenge of the project is to test on multiple browsers <strong>and</strong> multiple viewports. The site being tested is responsive, so we needed to handle that functionality.</p>
<p>To handle this, I took advantage of the WebdriverIO <code>setWindowSize</code> command. Using it, plus a defined set of viewports, I was able to switch viewport size around as needed.</p>
<p>I added a few element display checks, but didn’t go too far down that path. Element display checks are pretty routine in WebdriverIO, so I didn’t feel like spending time repeating the same code again and again. In a real test I’d definitely want to though.</p>
<p>After writing the traditional tests, I switched to setting up Applitools and the Ultra-Fast Grid.</p>
<p>While there is <a target="_blank" href="https://webdriver.io/docs/applitools-service.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">an Applitools service for WebdriverIO</a>, it’s not updated to support the UFG yet, so I stuck with using the SDK they provide.</p>
<p>I had to read through <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/webdriverio5.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">the documentation</a> a bit to get it all set up, but I was able to figure it out without too much pain.</p>
<p>After setting it up, writing my test was an absolute breeze. This is essentially the entirety of my test script:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>home.load();

browser.call(() =&gt; {
    return eyes.check('Cross-Device Elements Test', Target.window())
})
</code></pre>
<p>All we do is load the home page, then take a screenshot of the entire window, then send it off to Applitools.</p>
<p>Already, there’s a large difference between the traditional approach of manually writing element display checks, and just relying on the Applitools AI to handle all of that for us.</p>
<p>This is one of the true powers of Visual Regression Testing (VRT), and it shines in this example. VRT implicity checks text content, color, display, size and much more without you having to specifically ask for it for each and every element. It really is a fantastic technique for testing the UI of sites.</p>
<p>But, did the UFG live up to its promise of fast speeds? Well, at this point, not really.</p>
<p>For a good reason though. The tests we’ve written so far are extremely simple. They load a page and check a couple of items. There’s no login steps or other preperation steps needed to get to where we need to be in order to test. Because of that, the UFG doesn’t really get to flex its muscles and show off. But it’ll show off soon enough.</p>
<h3 id="task2shoppingexperiencetest">Task 2 – Shopping Experience Test</h3>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">
<p>
<iframe title="Comparing Cross-browser Testing Techniques (Part 2 of 3) - Live Stream" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FJI0AwYU_aY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p><figcaption>Video Replay of Stream #2</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next up on task list is to try filtering the product grid. I enjoyed this task, because it gave me the chance to show off how to extend Page Objects through the use of Components. I won’t cover it here, but check out the stream if you’re interested.</p>
<p>The traditional test was pretty straight-forward again. I did need to spend a little bit of extra time handling the filter functionality across viewports, but the way I set up the viewports made this much easier than it could have been.</p>
<p>So how did the modern approach compare? Well, it matched more evenly with the traditional approach this time, taking about the same level of coding effort. Both approaches caught the main bug on V2 of the site, which is that the shoes aren’t properly filtered.</p>
<p>One big difference between the two approaches is that the extra functionality I needed to write to handle the filter viewport differences isn’t needed in the modern approach. That’s because of the way the UFG works.</p>
<p>The reason why is that with the UFG, you run your test setup scripts (e.g., clicking the filter menu and selecting the options) once on your local machine, then the Applitools code takes a snapshot of the page HTML &amp; CSS and sends it to the grid for processing. This means that we can run our filtering steps in the desktop view, yet still be able to capture our screenshots in mobile view via Applitools.</p>
<p>We’ll dive deeper into the benefits of this approach later, but I wanted to mention this specific difference here.</p>
<h3 id="task3productdetailstest">Task 3 – Product Details Test</h3>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">
<p>
<iframe title="Comparing Cross-browser Testing Techniques (Part 3 of 3) - Live Stream" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9WE0UT1g-ME?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p><figcaption>Video Replay of Stream #3</figcaption></figure>
<p>For our final task, we take a look at the product detail page.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we’re able to re-use a lot of our previously written test code, as the steps to select the product needed are almost the same as our previous task (just adding the step to click the product link).</p>
<p>The main challenge of the test is writing the various assertions needed to check all the product details. There are several details to validate, including the name, price, SKU, description and more.</p>
<p>This puts us in a similar situation to Task 1, where we have multiple minor details on a page that we have to write assertions for. And similar to Task 1, using VRT really helps in this regard.</p>
<p>Not only does it help reduce the monotony of writing these assertions, in this task, it caught several bugs that my traditional tests didn’t. This is due to both me taking a shortcut by not writing all my checks, but also because my checks honestly wouldn’t have caught some of the bugs.</p>
<p>Here are three bugs that my traditional tests didn’t catch:</p>
<ul>
<li>SKU Number not shown. This is due to the text color matching the background. WebdriverIO’s <code>isDisplayed</code> command absolutely won’t catch this, since it doesn’t check for text color vs. background.</li>
<li>The text of dropdown changed. This is just too minute of a detail for me to write a test for. If I had to spend my time on things like that, not only would it take forever to write a full test suite, but keeping that suite up-to-date would be an absolute pain.</li>
<li>In the price, it changed from $33.00 to only $33. Again, this would be a very difficult thing to test for and would take a lot of time to get that level of detail using the traditional approach. But using VRT catches it with minimal effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a sneaking suspicion that the project was set up to highlight these sorts of bugs, and I don’t blame the creators one bit for exposing it. VRT is a very powerful technique and there’s nothing wrong about showing off specific examples of why.</p>
<h2 id="overallfeelingsobservations">Overall Feelings/Observations</h2>
<p>So that finishes up all three tasks. Now for some overall observations. I’ve talked about the difference between VRT and traditional testing, so I won’t cover that much here. I hope I made my point there.</p>
<p>But there are several other observations I had over the course of the work.</p>
<h3 id="ufgsspeed">UFG’s Speed</h3>
<p>Let’s look at the speed improvements that UFG claims to provide.</p>
<p>Honestly, in these tasks, UFG’s speed didn’t get to shine. There are a few of reasons why that is.</p>
<h4 id="webdriverioisalreadyfast">WebdriverIO is Already Fast</h4>
<p>The first is that WebdriverIO provides the ability to run tests in parallel by default, so I was able to run all three of my test files at the same time with little effort.</p>
<p>This is important, because if each of my traditional tests take 5 seconds extra, normally that would cost me 15 total seconds. But since those 5 seconds all occur at the same time (since the tests all run at the same time), then the pain is minimized.</p>
<p>But this parallelization only gets you so far. Due to computing limitations, you can only run so many tests at the same time. As you add more tests, you’ll quickly reach the limit of browsers you can run at once.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example of 80 tests that need to run on 8 environments (i.e., different devices/browsers/viewports). You will need to run these 80 tests, 8 times each test, which is 640 total runs.</p>
<p>Even if you could run 20 tests in parallel, you’d still have to go through 32 cycles of testing.</p>
<p>With UFG, you would only need to run 80 tests in parallel once (you can run all the tests on one environment in parallel with WebdriverIO). Divide that by 20, and you have only 4 cycles to complete. That’s 8x faster, because you don’t have to run each test 8 separate times for each environment.</p>
<p>So while it’s not too evident on small scales, once you level up your test suite, UFG’s speed really starts to show.</p>
<h4 id="thespeedpedalwasntpushed">The Speed Pedal Wasn’t Pushed</h4>
<p>While these example tests are useful as a demonstration, they aren’t very complex. They simply don’t do enough compared to what a more real-world example would look like.</p>
<p>Looking back, almost all the tests I’ve written over my career have involved some sort of login flow, which we didn’t have in our examples. And, in my experience, the login flow can be painfully slow, as the tests run through their extensive authorization process.</p>
<p>To simulate a more real-world example, what if we add an arbitrary 10 second pause in our tests? Let’s add it right after we load the page for each of our viewports/tasks. This pause is similar to what a login flow would take to run, so imagine it’s that.</p>
<p><strong>When added up, this 10-second delay would add over 70 seconds to our overall test run using the traditional approach.</strong></p>
<p>Why? Well, since that pause happens in our <code>beforeEach</code> hook, it occurs for each of our tests. With 7 total tests (3 each for Task 1 and 2, and once for Task 3), that’s 70 seconds.</p>
<p>Then, we take that 70 second delay, and multiply it by the number of browsers we’re testing in, which is 3. Now we’re 210 seconds slower due to this unavoidable delay.</p>
<p><strong>The Ultra-Fast Grid avoids most of those slow downs.</strong> Remember, our modern tests only needs to run the setup steps once per file, since the UFG handles the multi-browser aspect of everything.</p>
<p>So at most, we’re going to see 30 seconds added to our tests (10 seconds for each file). That’s three minutes of testing time saved over just 7 tests. And, no matter how many browsers we add to our suite, UFG always only takes 30 seconds, while traditional methods grow and grow.</p>
<h3 id="visualregressiontestingispowerful">Visual Regression Testing is Powerful</h3>
<p>The other part to consider here is that the UFG is running a full visual regression. That’s doing a lot more work than our traditional tests were.</p>
<p>Consider our first task. I ran about two assertions per test, getting the text of a couple elements and checking them.</p>
<p>What did our modern approach check? Well, essentially everything on the page. It checked the display and text of all the elements. It checked their visual display, including color, spacing, font size, font style, on and on.</p>
<p>It checked background colors, images, and overall layout. It ran hundreds, maybe thousdands, of assertions in the time it takes a traditional test to run two.</p>
<p>Aside from the test run time, it also provided a huge amount of savings from the test writing time. I don’t think I can emphasize enough how much simpler it is to write a visual regression check. I can’t imagine having to write all those thousands of assertions myself (or even worse, have to use my own eyes to manually check everything).</p>
<p>So, all those things considered, I really think I barely scratched the surface in the speed improvements that the UFG provides. It’s like taking a race car for a drive through a congested street, when it really deserves to be taken out to the race track.</p>
<h3 id="reducedflakiness">Reduced Flakiness</h3>
<p>Okay, so not only is the UFG faster than traditional testing (while also being far more powerful), it also reduces test flakiness.</p>
<p>By minimizing the number of times we’re going through specific actions, we’re reducing the number of interactions we have with potentially finicky flows.</p>
<p>Take the Login flow for example (which, in my experience, can be flaky on test servers). Say that, through no fault of the tests themselves, there’s an odd bug in the staging environment where every 100th login fails. This isn’t much of an issue for a manual test, since you’d just retry your login. But it’s a real pain for an automated test, since that failure can happen in the middle of a test run.</p>
<p>Using our example of 80 tests on 8 environments from before, using the traditional approach, we’d get at least 6 test failures due to the login bug (we login 640 times, so hit that magic 100 number 6 times).</p>
<p>But with the UFG, we’re only running our 80 tests once. We go from a sure six failures, to likely none at all. Even though we have all the same test coverage from before, we’ve minimized our interactions with the app to avoid errant failures.</p>
<h2 id="onefinalwish">One Final Wish</h2>
<p>I’ll end this all with a wish. I’d love to see <a target="_blank" href="https://webdriver.io/docs/applitools-service.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official WebdriverIO Applitools service</a> updated to include integrating the UFG features.</p>
<p>While Applitools does provide <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/applitools/eyes.sdk.javascript1/tree/master/packages/eyes-webdriverio-5#running-with-the-ultra-fast-grid" rel="noopener noreferrer">an SDK for WebdriverIO</a>, which includes support for UFG, it’s not quite as integrated into WebdriverIO as the <code>@wdio/applitools-service</code> is.</p>
<p>Fore example, for the sake of time during this project, I just copied over my UFG initilization code from test to test. But in a real job, I’d definitely want to avoid that. While I could set it up myself using a custom <code>wdio.conf.js</code> configuration, an update to the <code>@wdio/applitools-service</code> could be made to handle this for me in a simple way.</p>
<p>It would also help avoid having to wrap all my Applitools commands in <code>browser.call</code>, which can get clunky.</p>
<p>WebdriverIO services are perfect for minimizing the set up code. Seeing as there’s already an Applitools service, I hope it gets updated soon so I can use this functionality with even less work!</p>
<p>Overall, I really enjoyed the chance to implement this hackathon, and was impressed with what Applitools has to offer. I’m definitely going to see where I can use this in my work make the move to modern testing!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />

<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>Core to any organization is managing cyber risk with a security operations function whether it be in-house or outsourced. McAfee has been and continues their commitment to protecting cyber assets. We are dedicated to empowering security operations and with this dedication comes expertise and passion. Introducing SOCwise a monthly series of blogs, podcasts and talks driven by two highly experienced and devoted security operations professionals.  This is an ongoing resource of helpful advice on SOC issues, distinct SOC functional lessons, best practices learned from a range of projects and customers and perspectives on the future of security operations.  In addition, we will invite guests to contribute to this series.</p>
<h2><strong>Meet the SOCwise</strong></h2>
<h3><em>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/author/michael-leland/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Leland,</a> Technical Director of Security Operations, McAfee</em></h3>
<p>From the perspective of a ‘legacy SIEM’ guy I can tell you that there’s nothing more important to a security analyst than intelligence. Notice I didn’t say ‘data’ or ‘information’ – I didn’t even say ‘threat intelligence’. I’m talking about ‘Situational Awareness’. I’m specifically talking about business, user and data context that adds critical understanding and guidance in support of making more timely, accurate or informed decisions related to a given security event. A typical SOC analyst might deal with dozens of incidents each shift – some requiring no more than a few minutes and even fewer clicks to quickly and accurately determine the risk and impact of potential malicious activities. Some incidents require much more effort to triage in hopes to understand intent, impact and attribution.</p>
<p>More often we find the role of SOC analyst to be one of data wrangler – asking and answering key questions of the ‘data’ to determine if an attack is evident and if so, what is the scope and impact of the adversarial engagement. Today’s modern SOC is evolving from one of centralized data collection, information dissemination and coordination of intelligence – one where each stakeholder in security was a part of the pre-determined set of expectations throughout the evaluation and implementation process – to a fully distributed cast of owners/creators (application development, operations, analysts, transformation architects, management) where the lines of authority, expectation and accountability have blurred sometimes beyond recognition.</p>
<p>How can a modern SOC maintain the highest levels of advanced threat detection, incident response and compliance efficacy when they may no longer have all (or sometimes even some) of the necessary context with which to turn data into intelligence? Will Security Operations Centers of the future resemble anything like the ones we built in previous years. From the massive work-from-home migration brought on by an unexpected pandemic to cloud transformation initiatives that are revolutionizing our modern enterprise, the entire premise of a SOC as we know it are being slowly eroded. These are just some of the questions we will try to answer in this blog series.</p>
<h3><em>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/author/ismael-valenzuela/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ismael Valenzuela</a>, Senior Principal Engineer, McAfee</em></h3>
<p>I have worked for 20 years in this industry that we once used to call, information security. During this time, I have had the opportunity to be both on the offense and the defense side of the cyber security coin, as a practitioner and as a consultant, as an architect and as an engineer, as a student as well as a SANS author &amp; instructor. I want to believe that I have learned a few things along the way. For example, as a penetration tester and a red teamer, I have learned that there is always a way in, that prevention is ideal, and that detection is a must. As a security architect I have learned that a defensible architecture is all about the right balance between prevention, monitoring, detection and response. As an incident responder I learned that containing an adversary is all about timing, planning and strategy. As a security analyst I have learned the power of automation and of human-machine teaming, to do more analysis and less data gathering. As a threat hunter I have learned to be laser focused on adversarial behaviors, and not on vulnerabilities. And as a governance, risk and compliance consultant, that security is all about tradeoffs, about cost and benefit, about being flexible, adaptable and realizing that for most of our customers, security is not their core business, but something they do <strong>to stay in business</strong>. To summarize 20 years in a few phrases is challenging, but no one has summarized it better than Bruce Schneier in my opinion, who wrote, precisely 20 years ago: “security is a process, not a product”.</p>
<p>And I am sure that you will agree with me that processes have changed a lot over the last 20 years. This transformation that had already started with the adoption of Cloud and DevOps technologies it is now creating an interesting and unforeseen circumstance. Just when security operations barely found its footing, and right when it was finally coming out from under the realm of IT, garnering respect and budget to achieve desired outcomes, just when we felt that we made it, we are told to pack our things, leave the physical boundaries of the SOC and have everyone work remote.</p>
<p>If this didn’t introduce enough uncertainty, I read that Gartner predicts that 85% of data centers will be gone by 2025. So, I can’t help but wonder: is this the end of it? Is the SOC dead as we know it? What is the future of SecOps in this new paradigm? How will roles change?  Will developers own security in a ‘you code it, you own it’ fashion? Is it realistic to expect a fully automated SOC anytime soon?</p>
<p>Please join us in this new SOCwise series as Michael and I explore answers to these and more questions on the future and the democratization of SOC and SecOps.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Reading Time: 13 min   Black Friday is approaching fast. With the profound increase in e-commerce transactions this year caused]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div><span class="rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time">13</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">min</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Black Friday</strong> is approaching fast. With the profound increase in e-commerce transactions this year caused by the<strong> COVID-19 pandemic</strong>, record-breaking numbers of online transactions are expected in 2020.<br />Is your web application or e-commerce solution ready to <strong>handle this make-or-break period</strong> in the calendar? If it is, you can expect to gain huge amounts of increased revenue and customers from the <strong>Black Friday extravaganza</strong>…</p>
<p></p>
<p>But if it isn’t, then it’s your competitors that will be inheriting the extra revenue – and perhaps your once-loyal customers as they permanently switch to a more reliable option….</p>
<p>Practically all website stakeholders can appreciate the value and importance of having high-quality and meaningful load testing. But with an annual event like Black Friday, it’s impossible to understate the importance of keeping your application online and responsive.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7960 aligncenter" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Web-Monitoring_Gatling.png" alt="" width="189" height="191"/><br />A responsive and fast-loading online store inevitably translates to higher revenue. In 2018, France saw <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.criteo.com/blog/black-friday-cyber-monday-2018/" rel="noopener noreferrer">online sales increase by +265%</a></strong> on Black Friday, with traffic more than doubling compared to the typical average period.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only can you expect more visitors to your site, but <strong>users are actually prepared to spend more money</strong>. A 2019 study published by </span><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/943680/umfrage/geplante-ausgaben-am-black-friday-in-deutschland/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statista</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows that 38% of people planned to spend 101-300€ on Black Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brits alone are planning to </span><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.finder.com/uk/black-friday-statistics" rel="noopener noreferrer">spend £6 billion on Black Friday and Cyber Monday</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To empathise the<strong> importance of load testing times</strong> when it comes to Black Friday, a study from </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-answers/what-page-load-time-and-why-it-important/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BigCommerce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found than even a one-second delay can cause conversion rates to dip by as much as 7%, as <strong>end-users are not prepared to wait</strong> when they can simply visit a competitor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are about to enter the Black Friday period with <strong>insufficient or even zero load testing in place</strong>, then read on as this article is for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we will share </span><strong>7</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> load testing tips</strong> that will help to ensure Black Friday is a success for your system and your business. Additionally, you will see how to quickly set up and configure a robust, effective and powerful load testing framework from scratch with <strong>Gatling</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s get to it!</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 500;"><strong>Tip 1 – Start with an Open-Source Load Testing Tool</strong></span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be overly ambitious with your load testing efforts, especially when you are first starting out or are racing against time to prepare for an event like Black Friday. There is often no need to build a </span><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">testing cathedral</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or invest massive amounts of money in a commercial-level load testing solution. A few realistic, accurate and comprehensive load testing scenarios created with an open-source tool like Gatling represents a great starting point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s see how to get up and running in Gatling in minimal time:</span></p>

<p><strong>Running Gatling with a Build Tool</strong></p>
<p>Whilst running Gatling with the stand-alone version is great for an initial evaluation, you will quickly want to migrate to using a build tool. Gatling supports <a target="_blank" href="https://maven.apache.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maven</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://gradle.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gradle</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scala-sbt.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">SBT</a></p>
<div class="addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get up and running in your chosen build tool as quickly as possible, the easiest way is to clone the official Gatling demo repository for your chosen tool, and then start adding your own code to that:</span></p>
<div class="a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list" data-a2a-url="https://gatling.io/2020/02/18/welcome-to-nikie/" data-a2a-title="Welcome to Nikie!">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we have Gatling installed on our system, let’s move on to our next tip:</span></p>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 500;"><strong>Tip 2 – Start with a Simple Scenario</strong></span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When starting out, it’s important to keep things as simple as possible. Let’s look at how to write the most simple of testing scenarios in Gatling, where we simply load the homepage of our site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that we will be writing some </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.scala-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scala</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> code in this article,  or more specifically </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatling</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> code. If the thought of writing code is uncomfortable to you, rest assured that there is no need to feel intimidated when writing Gatling code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatling ships with a powerful DSL (Domain Specific Language) that makes it simple to construct a detailed load test by writing simple, meaningful and verbose words and phrases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look at one of the most simple Gatling scripts you might start out with to prepare your web application for Black Friday:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7986 aligncenter" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.20.18-300x177.png" alt="" width="490" height="289" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.20.18-300x177.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.20.18-1024x606.png 1024w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.20.18-768x454.png 768w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.20.18-500x296.png 500w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.20.18.png 1244w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px"/></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is our entire load testing script in these few lines, but let’s break it down line-by-line. We start by importing a couple of packages, which contain all the language definitions needed to make Gatling work:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7987" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.21.09-300x24.png" alt="" width="438" height="35" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.21.09-300x24.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.21.09-1024x82.png 1024w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.21.09-768x62.png 768w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.21.09-500x40.png 500w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.21.09.png 1244w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px"/></p>
<p>Next, we define our Black Friday load test simulation class (called <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7988" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.21.23-300x35.png" alt="" width="121" height="14" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.21.23-300x35.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.21.23-768x89.png 768w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.21.23-500x58.png 500w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.21.23.png 914w" sizes="(max-width: 121px) 100vw, 121px"/>) and we extend this from the special Gatling <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7989" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.21.30-300x64.png" alt="" width="65" height="14" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.21.30-300x64.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.21.30.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 65px) 100vw, 65px"/> class:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7990" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.23.30-300x15.png" alt="" width="440" height="22" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.23.30-300x15.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.23.30-1024x50.png 1024w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.23.30-768x37.png 768w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.23.30-500x24.png 500w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.23.30.png 1526w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px"/></p>
<p>Inside the simulation class we just created, we now define the protocol we want to use (HTTP in this case) and supply the default parameters. For our script, we are simply supplying the base URL of our web application:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7991" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.24.15-300x25.png" alt="" width="432" height="36" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.24.15-300x25.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.24.15-1024x86.png 1024w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.24.15-768x65.png 768w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.24.15-500x42.png 500w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.24.15.png 1524w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px"/></p>
<p>Now we can define the steps of the scenario itself. These are the steps that the virtual user will take on our website when we execute the load test. Because we are aiming for the simplest test possible to help us prepare for Black Friday, we are simply loading the home page here:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7992" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.25.16-300x53.png" alt="" width="430" height="76" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.25.16-300x53.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.25.16-1024x180.png 1024w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.25.16-768x135.png 768w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.25.16-500x88.png 500w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.25.16.png 1526w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"/></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although our scenario above only loads the homepage of our web application, for your Black Friday load test you will likely want to modify it to reflect the expected behaviour of your end-users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, as users will likely be searching regularly for the best deals, you can expect to see a significant increase in the number of searches being performed in your application. You should therefore modify your scenario appropriately so that users perform more searches than normal.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-7995 aligncenter" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.28.16-300x275.png" alt="" width="300" height="275" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.28.16-300x275.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.28.16-500x459.png 500w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.28.16.png 726w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we continue, let’s explain the differences between a </span><b>scenario</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a </span><b>simulation </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Gatling terminology:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><b>scenario</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> describes the steps a virtual user takes through the system i.e. load the home page, click on the product, add to cart etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the </span><b>simulation </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is the definition of the load profile that will be executed for the test, i.e. the number of users, the throughput and arrival rate of those users, the test duration etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this terminology in mind, we can look at the <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7996" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.29.16.png" alt="" width="39" height="17"/> block of our script, where we define the load simulation:<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7997" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.29.25-300x34.png" alt="" width="433" height="49" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.29.25-300x34.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.29.25-1024x115.png 1024w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.29.25-768x86.png 768w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.29.25-500x56.png 500w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.29.25.png 1466w" sizes="(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px"/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The above load simulation will simply run our scenario with a single user, which is a useful default to have in place when creating and debugging your Gatling script. When you are ready to run an actual simulation based on your expected traffic for Black Friday, you will update this <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7996" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.29.16.png" alt="" width="39" height="17"/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> block appropriately as seen later on in this article.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this basic script in place, let’s move on to our next tip:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 500;"><strong>Tip 3 – Create Accurate Scenarios</strong></span></h2>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to be confident that your test scenarios replicate the actions that your users will be expected to take. As discussed previously, on </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/black-friday-shopping-trends/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Friday you can expect to see a significantly increased number of searches</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on your site as users hunt for the best deals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to take time to model this behaviour in the scenario definition of our Gatling script. How this scenario looks will naturally depend on your application, but we can use the built-in </span><a target="_blank" href="https://gatling.io/docs/current/http/recorder/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatling Recorder </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to record the steps we expect our users to take through our application during Black Friday. </span></p>
<div class="addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-7998 aligncenter" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.32.41-300x255.png" alt="" width="364" height="309" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.32.41-300x255.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.32.41-1024x869.png 1024w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.32.41-768x652.png 768w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.32.41-500x424.png 500w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.32.41.png 1390w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px"/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Gatling recorder acts as a proxy, capturing the traffic that is generated as the user performs various actions on the website, such as searching for a product or going through the checkout process. This generated code is then turned into a Gatling script, which we can use for our scenario.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the </span><a target="_blank" href="https://gatling.io/docs/current/http/recorder/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatling Recorder documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, be sure to check out the </span><a target="_blank" href="https://gatling.io/academy/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatling Academy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for detailed video tutorials on using the Gatling Recorder to create Gatling scripts.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 500;"><strong>Tip 4 – Execute Different Types of Load Test<br /></strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about the different scenarios and situations your system might likely find itself in during this busy Black Friday period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going back to our original <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7988" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.21.23-300x35.png" alt="" width="129" height="15" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.21.23-300x35.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.21.23-768x89.png 768w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.21.23-500x58.png 500w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.21.23.png 914w" sizes="(max-width: 129px) 100vw, 129px"/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> simulation that we created earlier, we defined the following:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-8002" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.35.49-300x22.png" alt="" width="205" height="15" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.35.49-300x22.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.35.49-1024x77.png 1024w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.35.49-768x57.png 768w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.35.49-500x37.png 500w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.35.49.png 1230w" sizes="(max-width: 205px) 100vw, 205px"/></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This load test profile is suitable for when we are creating and debugging our Gatling script. But if we want to make sure our web application is ready for a busy Black Friday, we need to define a suitable injection profile!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that the injection profile is simply a chain of rules, which will be executed in the provided order, to describe the rate at which virtual users execute their test scenario (or “user journey”) through the system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to ask ourselves how we expect users to arrive at our system during the Black Friday period. Do we expect users to arrive at specific time periods throughout the day, or is it more likely to be a steady stream of traffic? </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-8003 aligncenter" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.37.15-300x298.png" alt="" width="243" height="241" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.37.15-300x298.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.37.15-150x150.png 150w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.37.15-500x496.png 500w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.37.15.png 558w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px"/></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If one of our competitor’s sites were to go offline during the Black Friday period, we could reasonably expect a sudden surge in traffic. Will our system be able to cope with that?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are we launching a special offer during this promotional period, such as a Black Friday Countdown? When word spreads on social media or otherwise, will this lead to a steadily increasing amount of traffic and load through the system?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering these questions and situations will help us to define our injection profile, also known as a type of test. Let’s look at three of the most common ones here:</span></p>
<p><strong>Stress Testing</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A stress test, also referred to as a “spike test”, represents a sudden surge in demand on the system. During this period, we can expect many new users to arrive at the system in a short amount of time. In Gatling, we could define this injection profile as follows:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-8004" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.38.17-300x32.png" alt="" width="422" height="45" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.38.17-300x32.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.38.17-1024x111.png 1024w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.38.17-768x83.png 768w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.38.17-500x54.png 500w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.38.17.png 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px"/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a Black Friday perspective, we might expect one of these surges to occur if one of our competitors suddenly went offline. Alternatively, a viral social media post or some other form of advertising that alerted customers to a potential offer could see this scenario occur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve this level of load and throughput in our test environment would likely require multiple load injector machines and support for distributed load-testing. </span><a target="_blank" href="https://gatling.io/gatling-frontline/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatling FrontLine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Enterprise version of Gatling, would enable us to execute such a test with just a few clicks whilst still using the script we created in the open-source version of the tool.</span></p>
<p><strong>Soak Testing</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Friday is a long event, typically running for three days across the US Thanksgiving weekend. In fact over the last few years, there is a trend with </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.which.co.uk/reviews/black-friday/article/when-is-black-friday-a5O8o7V3rGsF" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies running Black Friday events of longer periods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with some even lasting a month or more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soak testing allows us to ensure that our system performance remains stable and consistent for longer periods of increased load. The goal of this type of test is to identify problems in the system like memory leaks or high CPU utilisation, that only occur over a longer period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A simple Gatling injection profile might look like this:<br /><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-8005" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.39.10-300x33.png" alt="" width="427" height="47" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.39.10-300x33.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.39.10-1024x112.png 1024w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.39.10-768x84.png 768w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.39.10-500x55.png 500w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.39.10.png 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px"/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we wanted to add a period of ramping-load onto the system before staying at a steady rate, we could combine two Gatling DSL methods:<br /><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-8006" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.39.35-300x44.png" alt="" width="423" height="62" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.39.35-300x44.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.39.35-1024x149.png 1024w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.39.35-768x111.png 768w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.39.35-500x73.png 500w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.39.35.png 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px"/></span></p>
<p><strong>Capacity Testing</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea with Capacity testing is to keep increasing the load on the system until we find the “breaking point”, where transaction response times greatly increase and errors begin to occur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having identified this breaking point in our system, we can be confident of handling the expected levels of traffic that Black Friday is likely to bring through our system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To write a capacity test in Gatling, we can run at a constant throughput for an arbitrary amount of time, then ramp the load to an increased level before continuing with another constant load. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our injection profile might look something like this:<br /><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-8007" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.40.30-300x72.png" alt="" width="433" height="104" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.40.30-300x72.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.40.30-1024x246.png 1024w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.40.30-768x185.png 768w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.40.30-500x120.png 500w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.40.30.png 1238w" sizes="(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px"/><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of having to write out cumbersome code to repeat this process many times, we can take advantage of the Gatling DSL to write an expressive test for us:<br /><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-8008" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.41.09-300x71.png" alt="" width="431" height="102" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.41.09-300x71.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.41.09-1024x243.png 1024w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.41.09-768x182.png 768w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.41.09-500x119.png 500w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.41.09.png 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px"/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graphically, this scenario would look like this:<br /><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-8009" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.41.43-300x143.png" alt="" width="539" height="257" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.41.43-300x143.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.41.43-1024x490.png 1024w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.41.43-768x367.png 768w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.41.43-500x239.png 500w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-décran-2020-11-10-à-15.41.43.png 1292w" sizes="(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px"/></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 500;"><strong>Tip 5 – Measure Response Times as Percentiles</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond looking at errors and the error rate we see in our load test, the key metric to monitor is transaction response times. These can be monitored broadly in two different ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Response time as an </span><b>average </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– typically measured as the mean response time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or as a </span><b>percentile</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although using the average to measure response times can be tempting, it is an inferior approach, as it can hide the true response time of your system for the majority of your users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measuring response times in </span><b>percentiles </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is far superior when it comes to load and performance testing. These enable you to give an accurate reflection of what performance is like for the given percentage of your users. In our load testing results, if the 99nth percentile was shown as 100ms, this means that 99% of users experience a response time of 100ms or less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-8011 aligncenter" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Feedback-Form_Gatling.png" alt="" width="252" height="225"/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presenting metrics to stakeholders in this way is of far greater value. Remember that we want to make sure that the vast majority of users to our site have a great experience, with fast load times and good performance.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 500;"><strong>Tip 6 – Execute a Distributed Load Test</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming you have an application that is internet-facing, your traffic can and will come from many sources across the globe. Although starting out your load testing from a single load injector is a good start, and can easily be achieved with Gatling Open-Source, it is not sufficient to simulate a true real-world load test.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to generate the traffic for such a realistic load test, the traffic must come from multiple sources by using a distributed load testing infrastructure. This can typically be achieved by having multiple cloud-based load injectors running across a broad range of geographical availability zones.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-8012 aligncenter" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cloud-Server_Gatling.png" alt="" width="253" height="249"/></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executing a load test of this nature might sound both expensive and cumbersome, but that isn’t actually the case. Using </span><b>FrontLine</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Gatling’s Enterprise tool, you can take your existing Gatling test scripts that were created with the open-source version and run a distributed load test across a range of availability zones in the cloud with just a few clicks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatling FrontLine is available on demand. This means your load testing infrastructure is only deployed and active for the period of your load test executions, significantly reducing the cost of load testing when compared to other solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information on Gatling FrontLine, including a demo and </span><b>free trial</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, check the </span><a target="_blank" href="https://gatling.io/gatling-frontline/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatling FrontLine website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 500;"><strong>Tip 7 – Don’t treat Black Friday as a one-off</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Friday is a perfect reason to start investing in your load testing efforts, but once the event is over you shouldn’t stop there. Surges in traffic or unexpected load on your system could happen any time of the year, and your system needs to be ready to handle this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing load testing scripts with Gatling open-source is an excellent place to start, as we have seen in this article. Once you have those scripts in place and are ready to take your load testing to the next level with distributed load testing on demand coupled with detailed real-time reporting, Gatling FrontLine is the natural solution to progress to.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-8013 aligncenter" src="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Frontline_Demo-300x157.png" alt="" width="478" height="250" srcset="https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Frontline_Demo-300x157.png 300w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Frontline_Demo-1024x536.png 1024w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Frontline_Demo-768x402.png 768w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Frontline_Demo-500x262.png 500w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Frontline_Demo-1536x804.png 1536w, https://gatling.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Frontline_Demo-2048x1072.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px"/></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A minimal investment in high-quality load testing with Gatling FrontLine is highly worthwhile, as although you can never know when that next spike in traffic is likely to come, you want to make sure your system and your business are ready to handle it and take advantage.</span></p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to ensure that your web application will be ready for Black Friday, or any other peak traffic period, then high-quality and reliable load testing is essential. The open-source version of Gatling represents a fantastic place to start. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>APIs are an important interface in the modern computing world, where an increasing amount of applications and sites are hosted on online cloud platforms. APIs allow for communication between different applications which are built on service-oriented architectures, many different companies use the public API approach to share and make their tool more accessible to various users from external sources. Of course, all these APIs must be tested to ensure their functionality and usability, despite lacking a graphical interface and requiring a more programmatical approach, which can make the API testing flows more challenging and intimidating.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/the-ultimate-postman-tutorial-for-api-testing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postman</a> is the #1 tool when it comes to testing your APIs manually, but when it comes to API automation, scheduling and reporting as part of end to end API testing flows, it becomes more challenging.</p>
<p>End-to-end API testing flows can involve multiple input sources, such as HTML, Databases, Telnet/SSH, Mobile, Shell, Data files, other RESTful APIs and more. <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a>‘s test automation platform allows not only testing your APIs manually, but also to complete end-to-end API based test automation flows, schedule and run them periodically, get execution reports and all of that without any third party tools and without a single line of code <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>If you have teens and you haven’t yet heard of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.innersloth.com/gameAmongUs.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Among Us’</a> then I guarantee it won’t be long. Among Us is an online deception and strategy game that is having a real moment worldwide. Over the last six months, it has amassed 85 million players on both PC and mobile. In September, it broke the all-time record-setting peak player ceiling on <a target="_blank" href="https://steamcharts.com/app/945360" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> when nearly 400,000 people played it simultaneously and, Google Trends reports that there were 50 times more Google searches for it at the beginning of October, as compared to the beginning of August.</p>
<h3><strong>What’s The Game About?</strong></h3>
<p>Among Us is an online multi-player game that is set on a failing spaceship. Suitable for up to 10 players, it has been compared to ‘Murder in the Dark’ or ‘Murder Wink’ – the old-school party game you may have played as children.</p>
<p>At the start of the game, you’re advised whether you are a regular crew member or an imposter. Crew mates are tasked with completing small tasks that benefit the spaceship eg cleaning our air-conditioning ducts whereas imposters (between 1-3 players) create havoc on the spaceship and seek out victims to kill – without letting anyone know.</p>
<p>Every time a dead body is found, a crewmember will call a meeting to workshop who they think the imposter is. This is one of the few times players can talk to each other. As you can imagine, this can get very heated (and entertaining) as players try to implicate others and remove themselves from focus. All players then vote on who they think the imposter is – and the player with the most votes is ejected from the spaceship’s airlock.</p>
<p>Crewmates win by managing to repair the ship and eject all the imposters while the imposter wins by killing all the crewmates before they complete their jobs.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Has It Become So Popular?</strong></h3>
<p>Among Us was actually launched in 2018 but to little fanfare. But the planets have aligned for the developers at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.innersloth.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">InnerSloth</a> and it has become one of the biggest online games ever. In fact, it’s so successful that the developers have abandoned plans for a sequel and are instead, investing their resources into perfecting the original.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that pandemic life has contributed to the popularity of Among Us with many touting it as the ultimate group party game. In fact, some believe it brings all the energy and pizazz of board game night – just virtually.</p>
<p>It is extremely easy to learn. So, if you aren’t a gamer with years of experience (that’s me) you can absolutely play. This concept has been described by popular YouTube gamer <a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/Pegasus" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pegasus</a> as ‘ingenious’ for its simplicity, and praised for its ‘extremely social’ nature.</p>
<p>The game is also very well priced. In fact, it’s free on mobile – but you will have to view some ads. And it’s only around $7 on a PC – so much cheaper than anything my kids have played in years!</p>
<h3><strong>What Parents Are Asking</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Is it Suitable?</strong></h4>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/among-us-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Classification Board here is Australia gives Among Us a PG rating</a> which means the content is mild in impact. But they do state that PG rated content is ‘not recommended for viewing by people under the age of 15 without guidance from parents, teachers or guardians.’</p>
<p>In Australia, the game is rated as suitable for 9+ on the App Store. On Google Play it is nominated as suitable for ages 10+.</p>
<p>The role of the imposter in the game to hunt and murder players is aggressive and violent. Yes, it is a cartoon-like visual which does reduce the impact but there are still bodies left lying around after the deed is done.</p>
<p>Parents know their children the best. Absolutely take heed of the advice, but ultimately, you need to decide what’s suitable for them. If you do decide to let your younger children play – or they’ve already discovered it – please talk about violence in video games. Does watching violent images make them feel scared or more aggressive? Do they feel better if they talk about it or, in fact, choose to watch something less violent?</p>
<h4><strong>Can They Chat With Strangers During The Game?</strong></h4>
<p>There is opportunity to chat with strangers in the game but it is less than most online games. Players can chat in the online waiting room before a game starts and of course, there is also interaction in the meetings during which the group tries to work out who the imposter is. Enabling the censor chat mode is a good option here – this limits word and aims to block out expletives however I understand that isn’t completely fool proof.</p>
<p>But you can choose to play the game offline, locally, which means you play only with people you know. You simply share a generated code with the players you want to join the game. I highly recommend this for younger children and teens or if you want to play the game as a family. The game can be played with as few as four players which makes an offline game far easier to get happening.</p>
<h4><strong>Does It Share A Positive Message?</strong></h4>
<p>Both trust and deceit are at the core of this game. Learning who to place your trust in is part of being a successful crewmember in Among Us whilst being a master of deceit will win you the game as an imposter.</p>
<p>You could argue that these themes are no different to playing Murder in the Dark or even the old classic Cluedo. However, I would absolutely have a conversation with your kids about the difference between real life and online (or gaming) life. Why not weave it into your dinnertime conversation?</p>
<p>My boys are really enjoying playing Among Us, in fact – we have earmarked this weekend for a family game. But please ensure you are comfortable with the game before you give your kids the green light. And if you do, be assured that one of the reasons this game is so popular is because players feel like they are part of a community – and isn’t that what we all need at the moment?</p>
<p>‘till next time.</p>

<div>
<p>Many organizations are working toward digital confidence by optimizing their testing practices. This may look like reconfiguring the delivery pipeline to integrate quality more meaningfully, moving test infrastructure to the cloud, and automating an increasing number of test cases.</p>
<p>While all of these are helpful steps on the road to achieving digital confidence, some use cases might not benefit from more automated testing. Those cases will still require manual, or live, testing to ensure that functionality works as expected. </p>
<p>For example, one use case that may be difficult to automate is testing functionality like multi-touch gestures. This would typically require a real physical device and manual testing. </p>
<p>Sauce Labs understands that this can be a challenge. That’s why the mobile devices in our Real Device Cloud are available for you to test multi-touch gestures while performing live testing. If you ever come across a situation where you need to pinch or zoom on your mobile device but you don’t have access to the physical device, Sauce Labs has you covered!</p>
<p>When you start a live session on the Sauce Labs real device cloud and open a website, you can swipe and scroll by clicking on the screen and moving your mouse in the direction you wish to move. This is the same behavior as you would have on a physical device that you would hold in your hand.</p>
<p>To show you how easy it is to ensure your customer experience is flawless, we have included step-by-step instructions of how to perform multi-touch gestures during live testing sessions on the Sauce Labs platform. Simply follow these steps, using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.netflix.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.netflix.com</a> as an example: </p>
<p>1. To begin, hold down the <b>ALT</b> key (Windows) or the <b>Option</b> key (OS X). Two orange dots will appear on the screen, as you can see below:</p>
<div class="image"><picture><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/4P6VuUoatXmq9HRTa6f9CM/4fa552a522644620f9391703d8fe6195/netflix1.png?fm=webp" type="image/webp"/></picture></div>
<p>2. For using <b>zoom </b>(also referred to as zoom in/maximize), make sure you move the dots further away from each other on the screen. This will result in the screen you are viewing to zoom in like this:</p>
<div class="image"><picture><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/9h1nfY04zMMva93TB2blp/7222bc6f2bf89f9e3e732044153a571d/netflix2.png?fm=webp" type="image/webp"/><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/9h1nfY04zMMva93TB2blp/7222bc6f2bf89f9e3e732044153a571d/netflix2.png" alt="Netflix pinch zoom" title="Netflix pinch zoom" loading="lazy"/></picture></div>
<p>3. For using <b>pinch </b>(also referred to as zoom out/minimize), repeat step 1 and bring the orange points closer together: </p>
<div class="image"><picture><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/5aUUEVWwXLjA1Tte2IA181/b2e46fc29e1fc4175f767b4c4b53f06d/netflix3.png?fm=webp" type="image/webp"/><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/5aUUEVWwXLjA1Tte2IA181/b2e46fc29e1fc4175f767b4c4b53f06d/netflix3.png" alt="Netflix pinch example" title="Netflix pinch example" loading="lazy"/></picture></div>
<h3>Best Practices for Performing Multi-Touch Gestures in Live Testing</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keep in mind that the multi-touch gesture starts from the center of the screen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For using <b>zoom</b>, it’s recommended to place your mouse at the center of the screen and hold down the <b>ALT</b> key (Windows) or the <b>Option</b> key (OS X)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For using <b>pinch</b>, place your mouse outside of the center of the screen and hold down the <b>ALT</b> key (Windows) or the <b>Option</b> key (OS X)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also provided a video walk through of this exact process below so you are able to observe the entire process. If you&#8217;re using Sauce Labs, try out the functionality for yourself by logging into <a target="_blank" href="https://app.saucelabs.com/live/web-testing" rel="noopener noreferrer">your account</a>. If you don&#8217;t have an account, but still want to try live testing on real devices, sign up for a <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/sign-up" rel="noopener noreferrer">free trial</a>.</p>
