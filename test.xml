					<description><![CDATA[How much is it worth to catch more bugs early in your product release process? Depending on where you are]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[ 
<br><div>
													<div class="lead">
						
<p>How much is it worth to catch more bugs early in your product release process? Depending on where you are in your release process, you might be writing unit or systems tests. But, you need to run end-to-end tests to prove behavior, and quality engineers require a high degree of skill to write end-to-end tests successfully.</p>



					</div>
					
<!-- /wp:more -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What would you say if a single validation engine could help you ensure data integrity, functional integrity, and graphical integrity in your web and mobile applications? And, as a result, catch more bugs earlier in your release process?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Catch Bugs or Die</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s start with the dirty truth: all software has bugs. Your desire to create bug-free code conflicts with the reality that you often lack the tools to uncover all the bugs until someone finds them way late in the product delivery process. Like, say, the customer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>With all the potential failure modes you design for – and then test against – you begin to realize that not all failure modes are created equal. You might even have your own triage list:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Security &amp; penetration</li><li>Data integrity and consistency</li><li>Functional integrity and consistency</li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So, where does graphical integrity and consistency fit on your list? For many of your peers, graphical integrity might not even show up on their list. They might consider graphical integrity as managing cosmetic issues. Not a big deal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lots of us don’t have reliable tools to validate graphical integrity. We rely on our initial unit tests, systems tests, and end-to-end tests to uncover graphical issues – and we think that they’re solved once they’re caught. Realistically, though, any application evolution process introduces changes that can introduce bugs – including graphical bugs. But, who has an automation system to do visual validation with a high degree of accuracy?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Tradeoffs In End-to-End Testing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your web and mobile apps behave at several levels. The level that matters to your users, though, happens at the user interface on the browser or the device. Your server code, database code, and UI code turns into this representation of visual elements with some kind of visual cursor that moves across a plane (or keyboard equivalent) to settle on different elements. The end-to-end test exercises all the levels of your code, and you can use it to validate the integrity of your code.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JPfwRaN6oZapcOYgO8nHFqUsNTg8Dws7qfW4SY-Dp3HdGTUQPVEGxYtPg1H0ZUmCeUuekryggv_4flUJKByHFoOAYAIw8qXHSlrXLZpT1Uz9uc5N_vgdQEb4_HQZR7SczpTMIaj9" alt="code 2434271 1280"/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So, why don’t people think to run more of these end-to-end tests? You know the answers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, end-to-end tests run more slowly. Page rendering takes time – your test code needs to manipulate the browser or your mobile app, execute an HTTP request, receive an HTTP response, and render the received HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even if you run tests in parallel, they’re slower than unit or system tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, it takes a lot of effort to write good end-to-end tests. Your tests must exercise the application properly. You develop data and logic pre-conditions for each test so it can be run independently of others. And, you build test automation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Third, you need two kinds of automation. You need a controller that allows you to control your app by entering data and clicking buttons in the user interface. And, most importantly, you need a validation engine that can capture your output conditions and match those with the ones a user would expect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can choose among many controllers for browsers or mobile devices. Still, why do your peers still write code that effectively spot-checks the DOM? Why not use a visual validation engine that can catch more bugs?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Visual AI For Code Integrity</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You have peers who continue to rely on coded assertions to spot-check the DOM. Then you have the 288 of your peers who did something different: they participated in the Applitools Visual AI Rockstar Hackathon. And they got to experience first-hand the value of Visual AI for building and maintaining end-to-end tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I wrote previously, we gave participants five different test cases, asked them to write conventional tests for those cases, and then to write test cases using Applitools Visual AI. For each submission, we checked the conditions each test writer covered, as well as the failing output behaviors each test-writer caught.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a refresher, we chose five cases that one might encounter in any application:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Comparing two web pages</li><li>Data-driven verification of a function</li><li>Sorting a table</li><li>Testing a bar chart</li><li>Handling dynamic web content</li></ol><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For these test cases, we discovered that the typical engineer writing conventional tests to spot-check the DOM spent the bulk of their time writing assertion code. Unfortunately, the typical spot-check assertions missed failure modes. The typical submission got about 65% coverage. Alternatively, the engineers who wrote the tests that provided the highest coverage spent about 50% more time writing tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, when using Visual AI for visual validation, two good things happened. First, everyone spent way less time writing test code. The typical engineer went from 7 hours of coding tests and assertions to about 1.2 hours of coding tests and Visual AI. Second, the average test coverage jumped from 65% to 95%. So, simultaneously, engineers took less time and got more coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Visual AI Helps You Catch More Bugs</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you find more bugs, more quickly, with less effort, that’s significant to your quality engineering efforts. You’re able to validate data, functional, and graphical by focusing on the end-to-end test cases you run. You spend less time thinking about and maintaining all the assertion code checking the result of each test case.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using Visual AI makes you more effective? How much more effective? Based on the data we reviewed – you catch 45% of your bugs earlier in your release process (and, importantly, before they reach customers).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>Now more than ever, consumers and businesses alike are relying on digital experiences to deliver critical services, maintain normalcy, and provide comfort in uncertain times. From food delivery to video conferencing, streaming services to online banking, the shift to digital-first solutions has been accelerated. And with that shift, it is clear that digital confidence is poised to take the spotlight as a key enabler for organizations that want to grow their business.</p>
<p>Digital confidence is the idea that everyone in your organization, from leadership all the way down to the developers writing the code, expects that the applications they create function, look, and perform exactly as intended. Organizations that can create a culture and processes that are committed to this idea see a number of positive effects, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improved productivity &#8211; with digital confidence, engineering teams are empowered to continually innovate and build features that customers want. They can then introduce those changes quickly without fear of breaking anything.</p>

<p>Better user experience &#8211; digital confidence has the power to permeate your entire business, and that trickles down to your users. Customers who have a great experience with your application are more likely to return, creating reliable repeat business. This leads to the third benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased revenue &#8211; digitally confident organizations enjoy loyal customer bases, but those that take it one step further are able to create those customers across every channel. Ensuring your application covers web and mobile platforms (every browser, operating system and device combination) gives organizations the ability to reach more markets, and capture more revenue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This idea isn’t just a theory. There are digital organizations today that are experiencing the above benefits, and more, as they implement practices that build digital confidence.</p>
<h3><b>Quick Base Removes Testing Bottlenecks to Accelerate Release Velocity</b></h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.quickbase.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quick Base</a> provides a low-code application development platform that allows non-technical developers to create secure cloud applications without compromising IT governance and control. As they adapted their development pipeline to accelerate releases, they realized that testing was a major bottleneck. With a UI regression suite that would take upwards of five hours to complete, they were prevented from creating the fast feedback loops the team needed to deliver more features and capabilities to customers quickly.</p>
<p>By automating a large subset of tests in Selenium and WebDriver, and using Sauce Labs to run those tests at scale, Quick Base is now running that same UI regression in 15 minutes. This means that they can run these tests not just at the end of the development cycle, but every time a developer checks in code. “We find issues early in the pipeline because we can run tests in parallel,” explains Ken LaBak, a Senior Software Engineer in Test at Quick Base, “The teams get feedback much more quickly, and we can address issues before they ever get into our production environment.”</p>
<p>This type of fast feedback creates confidence across the entire organization, as they are empowered to deliver features at speed, knowing that there are quality checks built in to ensure the user experience is flawless. Creating this level of digital confidence has helped Quick Base not just in their everyday business, but has also helped them lead the way in the era of COVID-19. To learn more about how Quick Base’s digital confidence has helped in times of need, check out this SauceCon Online talk from Karen Motyka, Director of QA at  Quick Base, “Fighting a Pandemic with Software Quality.“</p>
<h3><b>LogMeIn Improves Productivity to Build Confidence in Quality</b></h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.logmein.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">LogMeIn</a> is a leading provider of cloud-based connectivity solutions. In this highly competitive space, their teams understand the importance of speed when bringing new and innovative features to market. They also knew that the mobile market presented opportunities to win more market share. They knew that in order to be confident in the features they were delivering, increasing test coverage was going to be a key factor.</p>
<p>Using test automation at scale in conjunction with the Sauce Labs Real Device Cloud, LogMeIn was able to provide the platform their teams needed to continuously test throughout the development lifecycle. “We have higher confidence in our software by using Sauce Labs,” says Parameshwaran Murli, Architect at LogMeIn. “Overall, our development teams feel stronger about the test results they’re getting using these two solutions.” This sense of confidence in test results means that developers are empowered to deploy more frequently, knowing that their features work exactly as intended. This allows LogMeIn to penetrate new mobile markets, and create more loyal users of their platforms.</p>
<h3><b>N26 Creates Creates Flawless Experiences in Their Mobile Banking Application</b></h3>
<p>Founded in Berlin in 2013, the mobile bank <a target="_blank" href="https://n26.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">N26</a> has redesigned banking for the smartphone, making it easy, fast, transparent and contemporary. An early player in the mobile-first banking space, they had a unique opportunity to capture new users to gain market share in a competitive industry. And they knew that manual testing was going to prevent them from reaching their goals. </p>
<p>Coupled with an initiative to automate their tests using Appium, the team at N26 relied on the Sauce Labs Real Device Cloud to provide access to the devices that they needed to ensure the best experience for all of their users. But while some teams think of testing benefits in terms of infrastructure cost or time savings, N26 understands the larger picture of creating digital confidence. According to Martyna Wojna, Quality Assurance Engineer at N26, “The main benefits to our business are continuous releases and happier customers.” Improved productivity gives teams the confidence that they are delivering the best experiences to their customers, and customers inherit that confidence. That has a long lasting effect on the health of the business, as N26 continues to build a growing base of loyal users.</p>
<h3><b>Building Digital Confidence for Your Team</b></h3>
<p>After reading these real world stories you might be ready to start building digital confidence for your organization. But many might wonder where exactly they can start. The road to digital confidence is long, and it takes buy-in from every level of the organization. Those teams that are successful in their journeys are the ones that are able to tie testing directly back to key business drivers, such as productivity, user experience, or revenue. If you can make those connections, and show how an improved quality strategy can accelerate gains in these categories, then you are well on your way.</p>
<p>Sauce Labs offers a number of resources to help you build a case for digital confidence. <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/digital-confidence?utm_source=organic&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=content%20&amp;utm_term=" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visit our website</a>, where we have research demonstrating the value of better customer experiences, reports on the ROI of continuous testing, and more stories like the ones above. Using resources like these as your guide, you’ll be on the path to digital confidence in no time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p>
<div>
<p>As is the case with many practices, DevOps has its fair share of <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/why-agile-leaders-should-stop-demanding-consistency-teams" rel="noopener noreferrer">destructive anti-patterns</a>. And some of them, such as the often celebrated &#8220;hero&#8221; anti-pattern, described below, can seem like a good idea at the time, but create devastation in the long run. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to recognize anti-patterns, understand how they arise, and act to prevent them before <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/optimize-devops-tb/5-mistakes-doom-devops?lx=vm26kZ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">they disrupt your DevOps projects</a>. </p>

<h3>Anti-patterns explained</h3>
<p>In software development, a pattern is simply a description of how to solve a problem. Sometimes that pattern is evident after the software has been created, and sometimes specific problems suggest the implementation of a specific pattern.</p>
<p>Patterns create a vocabulary for talking about software solutions in a way that most people can understand.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/best-practices-anti-patterns-containerized-deployments" rel="noopener noreferrer">An anti-pattern is a pattern</a> that you use to fix a short-term problem at the expense of your long-term goals. The insidious thing about anti-patterns isn&#8217;t that they don&#8217;t work or fail outright, but that they work in the short term while causing long-term failure and pain.</p>
<p>You got out of the frying pan for now, only to get into the fire later.</p>
<h3>Why anti-patterns are so sneaky</h3>
<p>People follow anti-patterns because they are useful in the short term. &#8220;In some cases, even the anti-patterns are better than not doing it at all. It is important to recognize this and not kid yourself into a false sense of security,&#8221; said my colleague <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrichardmills/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rich Mills</a>, DevOps solution architect at Coveros.</p>
<p>The problem arises when an anti-pattern becomes the new normal and the team stops there. The ability to recognize that you are using an anti-pattern and knowing how to get out of it is a key skill for continuously improving teams.</p>
<p>If you must embrace an anti-pattern, also embrace what you&#8217;ll need to do to move out of that anti-pattern as soon as you can. </p>

<h3>The hero anti-pattern</h3>
<p>Consider the classic hero anti-pattern, where one person or a small group goes to extraordinary lengths to deliver a project, usually by working a lot of extra hours to complete a project by the deadline.</p>
<p>To meet the timetable, however, the team may include substandard or dangerous code. In some parts of the industry, the hero pattern is not only in use but expected and celebrated. It has become a badge of honor to be a hero on a project. And, truth be told, there are <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/dont-be-devops-hero-youre-just-creating-devops-silo" rel="noopener noreferrer">times when teams need heroes</a>.</p>
<p>But there are long-term consequences of the hero anti-pattern. These include burnout and the development of negative relationships between team members. The latter often stem from the resentment of the &#8220;heroes&#8221; who supposedly saved the project from the people who didn&#8217;t go to the same lengths.</p>
<p>And when heroes burn out and leave the organization, they usually don&#8217;t leave behind the history of what they did because, when they were struggling to finish, many things, such as testing and documentation, got left out. This leads to lower-quality software with less stakeholder confidence in both the software and the team&#8217;s ability to deliver value.</p>
<p>In many cases, the hero anti-pattern is a reaction to management failure. The work wasn’t planned with the team’s capacity to deliver in mind. The team was asked to do more than it reasonably could given the schedule. There are many reasons why this happens, including regulatory demands, unmanaged stakeholder expectations, budget constraints, and unforeseen challenges.</p>
<h4>How to fix it</h4>
<p>One way to avoid dependence on heroes is to better manage the work scope, your deadlines, and expectations. This can be a tall order, but it is a way to finish your goals and not burn out your team.</p>
<p>Another way to not need heroes is to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/application-security-risk-report-2019-6-takeaways-your-app-sec-team" rel="noopener noreferrer">do risk analysis on the project</a><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/application-security-risk-tb/app-security-risk-takeaways?lx=qatC0j&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer"> </a>to determine what could derail the work. This will allow the team to incorporate risk mitigation into the work schedule. It can also get the team to estimate the work beyond best case scenarios.</p>
<p>You can also estimate using a range so that you don&#8217;t set the expectation that your estimates are certain and exact. Many agile teams use <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Fibonacci numbers</a> for assessments for just this reason; they want to model the uncertainty in their estimates.</p>
<h3>The continuous build anti-pattern</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/epic-devsecops-fails-6-ways-fail-right-way" rel="noopener noreferrer">DevOps isn&#8217;t immune to anti-patterns</a>, and continuous build (CB) is one such example. It&#8217;s what you get when you set up a continuous integration (CI) server without actually having a unit test suite or running code quality analysis on the codebase. You are building the software with each check-in. </p>
<p>(To clarify: CB is a subset of CI where you are only doing the first part of CI, and that is building. CI incorporates build, unit tests, and code quality static analysis.)</p>
<p>The CB anti-pattern is often <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-migrate-legacy-code-bases-continuous-delivery" rel="noopener noreferrer">used with legacy applications</a> or with a team as they transition to agile and DevOps. It often starts out with good intentions—you decide to put a CI server in place and start building tests. You don&#8217;t want to scare people with the large number of what you think are harmless issues by publishing code-quality metrics, so you tell yourself that you will put quality metrics in place after you&#8217;ve cleaned the code up.</p>
<p>But then feature requirements take the team&#8217;s attention away, and it never gets back to a place where it has enough unit tests to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/need-testing-metric-put-points-your-test-cases" rel="noopener noreferrer">start using quality metrics</a>, and it never finds time to clean up the codebase. The team is caught in a place where all it is doing is building the software with each check-in.</p>
<p>One thing you often hear when you talk to a team about this situation is, &#8220;It is so much better now than it was.&#8221; And this is often true; it is better to have a continuous build where you know if your software compiles and packages correctly than it was to build once a week, month, or longer and have to worry about making the software compile after an unknown number of changes.</p>
<p>Projects used to fail because huge parts of it were written in isolation and the differences couldn&#8217;t be resolved in a reasonable timeframe. But just because things are better now doesn&#8217;t mean they can&#8217;t be even better.</p>
<h4>How to fix it</h4>
<p>The goal of CI is to have confidence that you can merge the code written by different team members, compile it, and have it still work as the code author intended. You can&#8217;t do that without tests, and often unit tests are the right level of tests for that specific job.</p>
<p>The way to move continuous build into CI is to put that confidence back into the process by turning on unit testing and code quality analysis. Get your team, product owner, and stakeholders to agree to a change in your practices so that you will increase your unit test code coverage over time.</p>
<p>Get them to also agree to pay down your code quality <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/drowning-technical-debt-worse-youre-trapped-ponzi-scheme" rel="noopener noreferrer">technical debt</a> over time. These are issues that were created over time, and it will take time to resolve them, but only if you can agree on resolving them.</p>
<h3>Creating a DevOps silo anti-pattern</h3>
<p>Many organizations start their DevOps journey by adding a new DevOps silo that becomes the middleman between dev and ops. This becomes an anti-pattern when an organization stops moving dev and ops closer together into one team and just keeps the DevOps silo.</p>
<p><span class="disclaimer">Creating a separate DevOps silo used long-term is an antipattern.</span> </p>
<h4>How to fix this</h4>
<p>When a DevOps silo is created, the goal should be to work the dev and ops teams out of a job by bringing them closer together so that they collaborate as a conscious part of the work. The DevOps silo should have a defined time to &#8220;live&#8221; as part of the transformation charter. It should be something reasonable, say one to three years, and after that time the silo should no longer be needed. </p>
<p><span class="disclaimer">Within three years, your DevOps group should be structured like this.</span></p>
<p>In fact, the whole organization should be incented to help make the changes required to no longer need that silo, and the organization should have overlapping dev and ops groups where the DevOps work is done in the intersection.</p>
<h3>Selective automation</h3>
<p>This is what happens when office politics interferes with DevOps. It occurs when specific functions are excluded from automation because the people in charge of that function don&#8217;t, for whatever reason, want to have automation in their area. Being a bottleneck isn&#8217;t their problem.</p>
<h4>How to fix this</h4>
<p>To get the most value out of automation you need to have specific criteria used to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-automate-your-continuous-integration-collaborations" rel="noopener noreferrer">select what you automate</a>. These criteria could be based around what is most repetitive, the riskiest part of your process, where automation will create the highest ROI, or what takes the most time.</p>
<p>Once you set that criteria you should stick with it and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-get-started-rpa-5-projects-consider" rel="noopener noreferrer">automate processes </a>based on the priority generated from your selection criteria. Automating tasks that aren’t the highest priority can make your process <em>less</em> effective because it will create more backup in your critical path tasks as the automated, noncritical path tasks are completed faster.</p>
<h3>Recognize the warning signs</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve discussed four particularly pernicious anti-patterns here, but there are more to be aware of. As DevOps continues into the mainstream of software development, you can learn how to recognize and avoid anti-patterns. They may seem reasonable at first, but they&#8217;re bound to be damaging to your team—and your company—in the long run.</p>
