										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>In this post, we will discuss working with all new <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/14/announcing-testproject-new-opensdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject OpenSDK</a> to write native Selenium code of an existing code which is powered by the following:</p>
<table style="height: 146px; width: 44.791%; border-collapse: collapse; border-style: dotted;">
<tbody>
<tr style="height: 146px;">
<td style="width: 100%; height: 146px;">
<h4><strong>Note</strong></h4>
<p>The <em><strong>native Selenium</strong></em> code which we will be using in this post is available in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/executeautomation/SeleniumWithCucucumber" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2><strong>Native Selenium Code</strong></h2>
<p>The native <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium</a> code that we have as mentioned before is written in BDD format using Cucumber and running the test via the test runner of TestNG. The structure of the code looks pretty much like a regular test code, as below:</p>
<p></p>
<p><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-13692 size-full" title="Native Selenium Code Structure" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/codestructure.jpg" alt="Native Selenium Code Structure" width="352" height="732" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/codestructure.jpg 352w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/codestructure-246x512.jpg 246w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px"/></noscript></p>
<p>The code also uses Selenium Page Object Model, TestNG Listeners, and generates reports via Extent reporting. Well, this whole code uses Native Selenium Webdriver to perform UI testing and in fact, with this ‚Äúusual‚Äù approach, we have the following things to be taken care of as a tester <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f92f.png" alt="ü§Ø" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain ChromeDriver/Gheckodriver/EdgeDriver, etc with latest versions.</li>
<li>Write your own code for reporting (like extent reporting in this case).</li>
<li>Maintain browser drivers in CI/CD deployment machines.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Using TestProject‚Äôs OpenSDK</strong></h2>
<p>Using <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a>‚Äòs OpenSDK, now things are much simpler and it addresses the above pain points along with a lot of fascinating features! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="‚ú®" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic test reports in HTML/PDF format (including screenshots).</li>
<li>Collaborative reporting dashboards with execution history and RESTful API support.</li>
<li>Always up-to-date with the latest and stable Selenium driver version.</li>
<li>A simplified, familiar syntax for both web and mobile applications.</li>
<li>Complete test runner capabilities for both local and remote executions, anywhere.</li>
<li>Cross-platform support for Mac, Windows, Linux and Docker.</li>
<li>Ability to store and execute tests locally on any source control tool, such as Git.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Migrating Native code to TestProject OpenSDK</strong></h2>
<p>The first and foremost operation before beginning with our code migration is to get the OpenSDK itself. Since this is a Java Maven project, the reference we are going to set in the POM.xml file is going to look something like this:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null"><dependency>
    <groupId>io.testproject</groupId>
    <artifactId>java-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>0.63.2-RELEASE</version>
</dependency></pre>
<p>Next, the only code change we need to make in our native selenium code to use TestProject‚Äôs OpenSDK is this:</p>
<p><strong>Native code</strong></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">//Chrome driver - Using Native Selenium WebDriver
System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "/Users/ChromeDriver/chromedriver");
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
</pre>
<p><strong>TestProject OpenSDK</strong></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">WebDriver driver = new DriverBuilder<ChromeDriver>(new ChromeOptions())
        // Get Project Name from environment variable - CI/CD
        .withProjectName(System.getenv("BuildNumber"))
        // Get Job Name as Release Name from environment variable - CI/CD
        .withJobName(System.getenv("ReleaseName"))
        // Get TestProject Auth Token from environment variable - CI/CD
        .withToken(System.getenv("token"))
        .build(ChromeDriver.class);</pre>
<p>As you can see from the above code, the DriverBuilder sets the following parameters to invoke TestProject agent running in the target machine:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project Name</strong> ‚Äì Which can be any name, but since TestProject‚Äôs OpenSDK is going to automatically create the reports, it‚Äôs better to set a unique name as the project name. In this case, we are using CI/CD environment variables to set the project name.</li>
<li><strong>Job Name</strong> ‚Äì Which can be any name as well, but we are setting the <em>release number</em> as job name from CI/CD environment variable.</li>
<li><strong>Token</strong> ‚Äì This is a super-secret <em>token</em> to authenticate our TestProject agent with the TestProject platform and MUST need to come from CI/CD environment variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this, we can now run our test and get the automatic test report generated in the TestProject Platform as shown below</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I know you have looked into the GitHub repo. Let‚Äôs just get few more prerequisites installed and make sure they are ready to use and deep dive. Make sure you have installed and/or configured the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Java Installed</li><li>JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the Java SDK path</li><li>Android Studio IDE</li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Installing the Android Studio</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now let‚Äôs <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.android.com/studio" rel="noopener noreferrer">install Android Studio / SDK</a>¬†so that you can run the test script on an emulator or real device. You could install the Android SDK only but then you have to do additional advanced steps to properly configure the Android environment on your computer. I highly recommend installing the Android Studio as it makes your life easier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Download the ¬†<a target="_blank" href="https://developer.android.com/studio" rel="noopener noreferrer">¬†Android Studio executable</a>. Follow the steps below to install locally on your computer:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p>
<div>
<p>When evaluating ESM platforms,¬†think about how a given product fits in with the¬†direction of the overall market, as well as how it aligns with your¬†plans.¬†The vendor landscape has solidified, and the market is¬†competing vigorously for your business.</p>
<p>Here are the top five technology and market trends in Enterprise Service Management (ESM), and recommendations from experts on how to¬†make smart buying decisions and equip your teams with the skills they&#8217;ll need in the future.¬†</p>
<p><em>[¬†<a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/digital-transformation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get up to speed on digital transformation</a>¬†with¬†TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide. Plus: Get IDC&#8217;s &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-idc?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Transformation 2020 Top 10 Predictions</a>&#8221; ]</em></p>
<h3>1. AI, automation, and machine learning technologies are advancing rapidly</h3>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for 50 years, but actual business adoption is fairly new. <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/ai-transform-it-service-management?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESM vendors have been adding elements of AI</a>, automation, and machine learning to their offerings. &#8220;AI plus automation is a logical equation,&#8221;¬†said <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennisdrogseth/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dennis Drogseth</a>, vice president of¬†Enterprise Management Associates (EMA). &#8220;AI gives you insight, and automation gives you action. Action without insight equals train wrecks. Insight without action doesn‚Äôt help you very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>As much as people would like to embrace the benefits of AI and automation, the fierce competition and pace of development in this area can be paralyzing. While there are many different kinds of AI and automation, it will eventually come together as &#8220;a new landscape, not a single direction,&#8221;¬†Drogseth said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to get started now, even though the landscape is still developing. &#8220;I tell my clients, the sooner you jump in the pool and start swimming, the sooner you&#8217;ll be able to take advantage of it,&#8221;¬†said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/dougtedder" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Doug Tedder</a>, principal of¬†Tedder Consulting. Your team will gain experience, your organization will start to reap benefits, and you will be ready to use the innovations when they hit the street.</p>
<h3>2. AIOps is bringing service management under a single pane of glass</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/top-10-predictions-ai-it-operations" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artificial intelligence for IT operations</a> (AIOps) technology is changing the service management game by allowing you to control all your service management capabilities under a single pane of glass. &#8220;We&#8217;ve talked about it for years, but it&#8217;s finally here,&#8221;¬†said Tedder. &#8220;AIOps platforms let you bring together all of your network monitoring, operations monitoring, and application portfolio monitoring, do some correlation, and visualize it together,&#8221;¬†he said.</p>
<p>In service management, the big advantage this gives you is faster insight, which leads to improved quality. You can focus your efforts on the most important things that are happening, &#8220;and when something goes wrong you can hit pause much quicker,&#8221;¬†said Tedder.</p>
<p><em>[ Find out <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/robotic-process-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to roll out Robotic Process Automation</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide.

<h3>3. ESM is integrating with DevOps</h3>
<p>The top ESM platforms are designed for maximum interoperability, including most enterprise DevOps tools. This is crucial for long-term success. &#8220;You must be able to integrate ESM with the application development lifecycle,&#8221;¬†said <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelpott/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Michael Pott</a>, senior product marketing manager at Micro Focus. This will let you use the principles from ITSM to manage a variety of services, confident that all of the technology underpinnings‚Äîyour ESM and DevOps tools‚Äî will work harmoniously together.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you‚Äôre doing in DevOps needs to fit in with service management, at the end of the day,&#8221;¬†said Tedder. &#8220;Service management ensures you&#8217;re delivering value. And <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/devops-how-deliver-services-not-just-products" rel="noopener noreferrer">DevOps is actually about delivering a complete value stream</a>.&#8221;¬†</p>
<p>Tedder finds that many people still think that DevOps is somehow separate from ESM or¬†ITSM. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say this strongly enough: DevOps is ITSM. It‚Äôs just a different approach‚Äîbut there‚Äôs no philosophical, technical, or conceptual reason why DevOps and ITSM can‚Äôt get along,‚Äù he said.</p>
<h3>4.¬†ESM will manage services pre-cloud and in the cloud</h3>
<p>&#8220;The cloud will be a huge influence on the future direction of ESM development,&#8221;¬†said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/JayneGroll" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jayne Groll</a>, CEO of the DevOps Institute. &#8220;After all, you already need to manage and deliver services pre-cloud as well as in private, public, and hybrid clouds. ESM vendors are working to make that easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many ESM apps are cloud-native‚Äîbuilt specifically for the cloud‚Äîbut your organization will probably use them along with other kinds of apps already in place in your environment, including on the mainframe.</p>
<p>All of that affects how you&#8217;ll manage services now and in the future. &#8220;You&#8217;ll need specific skills to get the proper relationship with the cloud, and you&#8217;ll need an ESM platform that enables your team to be successful,&#8221;¬†Groll said.</p>
<h3>5. Expect to see more vertical-specific integrations</h3>
<p>EMA&#8217;s¬†Drogseth expects platform evolution to include vertical-specific integrations that move beyond reporting. Vendors are moving toward intelligent ESM platforms with good analytics, service modeling, and a core platform specialized for use in specific verticals. &#8220;This movement is already underway, and is not very far off,&#8221;¬†he said.</p>
<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
<p>These are the five most important trends to consider for your ESM tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AI, automation, and machine learning technologies are advancing rapidly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AIOps is pulling¬†service management for all your systems into one platform</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ESM is integrating with DevOps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ESM will manage services both on-premises and in the cloud</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expect to see¬†more industry-specific¬†integrations</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>The First Smartphone for Free-Ranging Kids</h2>
<p>In an earlier article, we took a look at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/smartphone-alternatives-for-free-ranging-kids/" rel="noopener noreferrer">smartphone alternatives for free-ranging kids</a>. Next up is the follow-on conversation ‚Ä¶ the time you give them their first, fully functional smartphone‚Äîand how to manage having it in your lives.</p>
<p>For children, learning to use a first smartphone is just like learning to ride a bike. And that‚Äôs just as true for you just as it is for them.<br />When a child learns to ride a bike, they take it in steps and stages. Maybe they start tooling around on little kick-bikes, a tricycle, scooter, or so on, just to get their feet under them so to speak. Next, it‚Äôs that first bike with training wheels, and then the big day that they come off (complete with a few scrapes and bruises too). They‚Äôre on two wheels, and a whole new world has opened up for them‚Äîone that you have to monitor and parent as you give them increasing freedom to roam‚Äîfrom the block, to the neighborhood, to your town‚Äîas they grow older and more responsible.</p>
<h3>Your Child‚Äôs First Smartphone</h3>
<p>Now, apply that same progression to the day your child finally gets their first smartphone. Plenty has led up to that moment: the times when they first tapped around your phone as a toddler, when as a preschooler they watched cartoons on a tablet, and maybe when they got a little older they had some other device, like a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/smartphone-alternatives-for-free-ranging-kids/" rel="noopener noreferrer">smartphone alternative</a> designed just for kids.</p>
<p>Then comes along that first smartphone. And for parents it‚Äôs a game-changer, because it opens up yet another new world to them. The entire internet.</p>
<p>As you can see, your child doesn‚Äôt enter the world of smartphones entirely cold. They‚Äôve already been on the internet and had the chance to experience selective slices of it under your supervision. But a smartphone‚Äîwell, that‚Äôs another story entirely. A smartphone, out of the box, is a key to the broader internet. And just as you likely wouldn‚Äôt let your brand-new cyclist ride five miles to go and buy ice cream in town, there are plenty of places you wouldn‚Äôt let your new internet user go.</p>
<p>What follows here are a few words of advice that can ease your child into that new world, and ease you into it as well, so that you can all get the tremendous benefits of smartphone ownership with more confidence and care.</p>
<h3>Start with the Basics: Smartphone Protection and Parental Controls</h3>
<p>Whether you go with an Android device or iPhone, make sure you protect it. You can get <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/android.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile security for Android phones</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/ios.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile security for iPhones</a> that‚Äôll give you basic protection, like system scans, along with further protection that steers your child clear of suspicious websites and links. While I recommend protection for both types of phones, I strongly recommend it for Android phones given the differences in the way Apple and Android handle the code that runs their operating systems.</p>
<p>Apple is a ‚Äúclosed platform,‚Äù meaning that they do not release their source code to the public and partners. Meanwhile, Android is ‚Äúopen-source‚Äù code, which makes it easier for people to modify the code‚Äîhackers included. So while Apple phones have been historically less prone to attacks than Android phones, any device you own is inherently a potential target, simply because its connected to the internet. Protect it. (Also, for more on the differences between the security on Android phones and iPhones, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.howtogeek.com/217593/android-is-open-and-ios-is-closed-but-what-does-that-mean-to-you/" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out this article from How-To Geek.</a> It‚Äôs worth the quick read.)</p>
<p>Next up on your list is to establish a set of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/parental-controls/mcafee-safe-family.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">parental controls for the smartphone.</a> You‚Äôll absolutely want these as well. After all, you won‚Äôt be able to look over their shoulder while they‚Äôre using their phone like you could when they were little. Think of it as the next line of protection you can provide as a parent. A good set of parental controls will allow you to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">‚Ä¢ Monitor their activity on their phone‚Äîwhat they‚Äôre doing and how much they‚Äôre doing it.<br />‚Ä¢ Limit their screen time‚Äîallowing you to restrict access during school hours or select times at home.<br />‚Ä¢ Block apps and filter websites‚Äîa must for keeping your children away from distractions or inappropriate content.</p>
<p>The great thing about parental controls is that they‚Äôre not set in stone. They give you the flexibility to parent as you need to parent, whether that‚Äôs putting the phone in a temporary time out to encourage time away from the screen or expanding access to more apps and sites as they get older and show you that they‚Äôre ready for the responsibility. Again, think about that first bike and the day you eventually allowed your child ride beyond the block. They‚Äôll grow and become more independent on their phone too.</p>
<h3>You need more than technology to keep kids safe on their smartphones.</h3>
<p>Unlike those rotisserie ovens sold on late-night infomercials, a smartphone isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù proposition. Moreover, you won‚Äôt find the best monitoring, safety, and guidance software in an app store. That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs you.</p>
<p>As a parent, you already have a strong sense of what does and does not work for your household. Those rules, those expectations, need to make the jump from your household to your child‚Äôs smartphone and your child‚Äôs behavior on that smartphone. Obviously, there‚Äôs no software for that. Here‚Äôs the thing, though: they‚Äôve established some of those behaviors already, simply by looking at you. Over the years, your child has seen your behavior with the phone. And let‚Äôs face it, none of us have been perfect here. We‚Äôll sneak a peek at our phones while waiting for the food to show up to the table at a restaurant or cracked open our phones right as we‚Äôve cracked open our eyes at the start of the day.</p>
<p>So, for starters, establishing the rules you want your child to follow may mean making some fresh rules for yourself and the entire household. For example, you may establish that the dinner table is a phone-free zone or set a time in the evening when phones are away before bedtime. (On a side note, research shows that even <a target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side" rel="noopener noreferrer">dim light from a smartphone</a> can impact a person‚Äôs sleep patterns and their health overall, so you‚Äôll want to consider that for your kids‚Äîand yourself!)</p>
<p>Whatever the rules you set in place end up being, make them as part of a conversation. Children of smartphone age will benefit from knowing not only what the rules are but why they‚Äôre important. Aside from wanting them to be safe and well, part of the goal here is to prepare them for the online world. Understanding ‚Äúthe why‚Äù is vital to that.</p>
<h3>‚ÄúThe (Internet) Talk‚Äù</h3>
<p>And that leads us to ‚ÄúThe Internet Talk.‚Äù. In a recent McAfee blog on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/what-security-means-to-families/" rel="noopener noreferrer">‚ÄúWhat Security Means to Families,‚Äù</a> we referred to the internet as a city, the biggest one there is. And if we think about letting our children head into town on their bikes, the following excerpt from that blog extends that idea to the internet:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>For all its libraries, playgrounds, movie theaters, and shopping centers, there are dark alleys and derelict lots as well. Not to mention places that are simply age appropriate for some and not for others. Just as we give our children freer rein to explore their world on their own as they get older, the same holds true for the internet. There are some things we don‚Äôt want them to see and do. </em></p>
<p>There are multiple facets to ‚ÄúThe Talk,‚Äù ranging anywhere from ‚Äústranger danger‚Äù to cyberbullying, and just general internet etiquette‚Äînot to mention the basics of keeping safe from things like malware, bad links, and scams. That‚Äôs a lot! Right? It sure is.</p>
<p>The challenge is this: while we‚Äôve grown up with or grown into the internet over the course of our lives, the majority of children are amongst the first waves of children who were ‚Äúborn into‚Äù the internet. As parents, that means we‚Äôre learning much, if not all, of what we know about digital parenting from scratch.</p>
<p>The good news is that you‚Äôre far from alone. Indeed, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/whats-the-right-age-to-give-your-child-a-phone/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a good portion of our blog is dedicated entirely to family safety</a>. And with that, I‚Äôve pulled out a few select articles below that can give you some information and inspiration for when it‚Äôs time to have ‚ÄúThe Internet Talk.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/what-leads-a-child-to-connect-with-strangers-online/?hilite=%27strangers%27" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stranger Danger</a><br />‚Ä¢ <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/reports-of-online-predator-on-the-rise-how-to-keep-your-kids-safe/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keeping Your Kids Safe from Predators Online</a><br />‚Ä¢ <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/7-conversations-to-help-develop-your-familys-digital-literacy-iq/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building Digital Literacy</a><br />‚Ä¢ <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/dangerous-digital-rituals-is-your-child-sleep-deprived/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Screen Time and Sleep Deprivation in Kids</a><br />‚Ä¢ <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/lessons-learned-a-decade-of-digital-parenting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lessons Learned: A Decade of Digital Parenting</a><br />‚Ä¢ <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/helping-kids-think-critically-about-influencers-they-follow-online/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Influencers and Your Kids</a><br />‚Ä¢ <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/want-your-kids-to-care-more-about-online-safety-try-these-7-tips/?hilite=%27kids%27%2C%27safety%27" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting Kids to Care About Their Safety Online</a></p>
<p>And those are just a few for starters. We have plenty more, and a quick search will keep them coming. Meanwhile, know that once you have The Internet Talk, keep talking. Making sure your child is safe and happy on the internet is an ongoing process‚Äîand conversation, which will cover more in a moment.</p>
<h3>Keeping tabs on their activity</h3>
<p>One reason parents often cite for giving their child a smartphone is its location tracking capabilities that allow parents to see where their children are ranging about with a quick glance. And whether or not you choose to use such tracking features, that‚Äôs a decision you‚Äôll have to make. However, consider your child‚Äôs privacy when you do. That‚Äôs not to say that you‚Äôre not in charge or that you shouldn‚Äôt track your child. Rather, it‚Äôs a reminder that your child is in fact getting older. Their sense of space and privacy is growing. Thus, if you choose to monitor their location, let them know you‚Äôre doing it. Be above the board with the intent that if you don‚Äôt hide anything from them, they‚Äôll be less inclined to hide anything from you.</p>
<p>The same applies to parental controls software. Many of them will issue a report of app usage and time spent using the app, along with surfing habits too. Go ahead, monitor those early on and then adjust as them as it feels right to you. Let your child know that you‚Äôre doing it and why.</p>
<p>Another thing I‚Äôve seen many of the parents I know do is share the credentials to any social media account their child sets up. Doing this openly lets your child take those first steps into social media (when you feel they‚Äôre ready) while giving you the opportunity to monitor, correct, and even cheer on certain behaviors you see. Granted, it‚Äôs not unusual for kids to work around this by setting up alternate accounts that they hide from their parents. With parental controls in place, you can mitigate some of that behavior, yet vigilance and openness on your part will be the greatest tool you have in that instance.</p>
<p>While you‚Äôre at it, go ahead and have conversations with your kid about what they‚Äôre doing online. Next time you‚Äôre in the car, ask what‚Äôs the latest app their friends are using. Take a peek at what games they‚Äôre playing. Download that game yourself, give it a try, and play it online with them if you can. This kind of engagement makes it normal to talk about the internet and what‚Äôs happening on it. Should the time come to discuss more serious topics or pressing matters (like a cyberbullying event, for instance), you have a conversational foundation already built.</p>
<h3>The common denominator is you.</h3>
<p>So, as we‚Äôve discussed, technology is only part of the answer when managing that first smartphone in your child‚Äôs life. The other part is you. No solution works without your engagement, care, consistent application of rules, and clear expectations for behavior.</p>
<p>So, as you once looked on proudly as those training wheels came off your child‚Äôs first bike, you‚Äôll want to consider doing the digital equivalent in those first months of that first smartphone. Keep your eyes and ears open as they use it. Have conversations about where their digital travels have taken them‚Äîthe games they‚Äôre playing, the friends they‚Äôre chatting with. While you do, keep a sharp eye on their moods and feelings. Any changes could be a sign that you need to step in and catch them before they fall or pick them up right after they‚Äôve fallen.<br />In all, your child‚Äôs first smartphone is a wonderful moment for any family, as it represents another big step in growing up. Celebrate it, have fun with it, and play your role in making sure your child gets the very best out of it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p>
<div>
<p>Organizations that¬†adopt¬†artificial intelligence (AI) in testing of microservices-based applications gain better accuracy, faster results, and greater operational efficiency.</p>
<p>AI and machine-learning technologies¬†have matured over the last¬†few years, and today <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/why-ai-perfect-software-testing-assistant" rel="noopener noreferrer">their application in automated testing</a> can help in more ways than one. In fact, AI has redefined the way microservices-based applications are tested, especially when it comes to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-canary-testing" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">canary testing</a>.¬†</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/ai-test-automation-tb/why-ai-in-testing-matters?lx=gd1AjL&#038;utm_source=techbeacon&#038;utm_medium=referral&#038;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">The introduction of AI in software testing </a>helps both developers and testers alike. It improves accuracy;¬†the same steps can be performed accurately every time they&#8217;re needed. Automated testing can increase both the depth and scope of your tests, resulting in more thorough¬†overall test coverage. You can also leverage AI to simulate a large number of users interacting with your application.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how AI-enabled¬†automation can help you test as you <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/challenges-scaling-microservices" rel="noopener noreferrer">scale microservices-based applications</a>, as well as the challenges you&#8217;ll face¬†and effective strategies you can adopt to overcome them.¬†</p>
<h3>Why traditional testing strategies don&#8217;t work</h3>
<p>Traditionally, when¬†creating¬†monolithic applications, you&#8217;d¬†test each unit of¬†code <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/catch-more-bugs-how-produce-unit-tests-real-time" rel="noopener noreferrer">with unit tests</a>. As different components of the application are joined together, you typically¬†test your application using integration testing first and, usually, system testing, regression testing, and user acceptance testing follow.</p>
<p>If the code passes all of these tests, the release¬†goes out.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/3-non-negotiable-tests-microservices-distributed-app-environments" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing microservices-based applications</a> is not an easy task and is not the same as testing monoliths; you must be aware of not only the service you are testing but also its dependencies‚Äîthe services that work with the services under test.¬†</p>
<p>Owing to the granular nature of microservices architecture, boundaries that were previously hidden in a traditional¬†application¬†are exposed. You might have several different teams spread across geographical distances working simultaneously on different services;¬†this makes coordination extremely challenging. It can be¬†difficult to find a particular time window to perform end-to-end testing of the application as a whole.</p>
<p>The distributed nature of microservices-based development poses many challenges to¬†testing your application. These¬†include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Availability:</strong>¬†Because of the distributed nature of microservices architecture, it is difficult to find a time when all microservices are available.</li>
<li><strong>Isolation:</strong>¬†Microservices are designed to work in isolation together with other loosely coupled services. This implies that you should be able to test every component in isolation as well as testing them together.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge gap:</strong> You should possess a strong knowledge of each microservice;¬†this would help you to write effective test cases.</li>
<li><strong>Data:</strong> Each microservice can have its own copy of data. In other words,¬†each¬†can have its own copy of the database, which may be different from another microservice&#8217;s copy. As a result, data integrity poses a challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Transactionality:</strong>¬†Unlike with a monolith, where transactionality is often assured at the database level, implementing transactionality between different microservices is challenging, because a transaction can consist of various service calls spread across different servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, a microservices-based application consists of several services, each of which can dynamically scale up if needed. There is also a risk of failure and the cost of fixing bugs or <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/integration-tests-dont-cut-it-microservices-heres-what-does" rel="noopener noreferrer">issues after integration</a>. Hence, you should have an effective test strategy in place for testing microservices-based applications.¬†</p>
<h4>How to build an effective testing strategy</h4>
<p>To build an automated <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/3-non-negotiable-tests-microservices-distributed-app-environments" rel="noopener noreferrer">testing process for a microservices-based application</a>, you should¬†follow the same best practices you would for any other type of testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>¬†Understand the customer&#8217;s expectations as far as test automation is concerned.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-qa-teams-can-build-culture-quality-8-key-routes" rel="noopener noreferrer">Set quality goals</a>‚Äîand adhere to them.</li>
<li>Analyze the testing types that are right for you to achieve the goals.</li>
<li>Write tests according to the test pyramid (i.e., considering that the cost of the tests increases as you move up the pyramid).</li>
</ul>
<h3>AI-driven test automation: Embrace innovation</h3>
<p>Today&#8217;s software testers can <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/ai-revolution-software-testings-new-best-friend" rel="noopener noreferrer">take advantage of AI</a> for test creation, test execution, and data analysis by using natural-language processing and advanced modeling techniques. <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/why-ai-perfect-software-testing-assistant" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI-based sofware¬†testing can help</a> by increasing efficiency, facilitating faster releases, improving test accuracy and coverage, and allowing for easier test maintenance, particularly when it comes to managing your test data.¬†</p>
<p>For efficient test maintenance, you need to¬†know <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/want-effective-test-automation-devops-manage-your-test-data" rel="noopener noreferrer">what is happening to your data</a> at the time of test creation. Inadequate data modeling is one reason¬†why test maintenance fails,¬†becoming¬†a bottleneck in your deployment pipeline. AI can help with efficient data modeling and with root-cause analysis.</p>
<p>Repeating tests manually each time the source code changes¬†can be time-consuming and costly. Once you create automated tests, you execute them¬†repeatedly and quickly with no additional cost.</p>
<h3>Use AI for canary testing</h3>
<p>Canary testing¬†helps reduce risks by gradually rolling out the changes to a small group of users before presenting it¬†to a larger audience‚Äîand it is particularly useful in the testing of microservices-based applications. In a typical¬†application, the changes to¬†microservices happen independently of one another, so those¬†microservices need to¬†be verified independently as well.</p>
<p>AI can help automate¬†canary testing of¬†microservices-based applications. You can take advantage of AI concepts such as deep¬†learning to identify the changes in the new code and the issues within¬†it.¬†AI can be used to compare the experience of the small group of users¬†with that of the existing users, and this can be done automatically;¬†you don&#8217;t need any human intervention in the loop.</p>
<h3>Challenges in AI-based microservices testing</h3>
<p>AI-based testing does have some constraints. While you can automate functional and unit tests, it is quite difficult to automate integration tests, because of complexity.</p>
<p>Some of the other challenges in AI-based testing include the following:¬†</p>
<h4>Skills</h4>
<p>Testing microservices-based applications with an AI-based approach requires extensive technical expertise from testers, and is very different from what¬†manual or automation testers¬†are used to. Testers should be adept at how to use¬†AI-based tools specifically for¬†microservices-based applications.¬†</p>
<h4>Use cases¬†</h4>
<p>Learn how¬†to determine the best use cases for using AI in microservices¬†test automation. One¬†is to use AI for¬†creating your¬†unit tests. You can take advantage of AI to perform static code analysis and determine the portions of code that are not covered by your unit tests.</p>
<p>You can also use AI to update unit tests as soon as the source code changes, as well as for¬†test creation, execution,¬†data analysis, and API testing in microservices-based applications.</p>
<p>AI can help you understand the patterns and relationships in¬†API calls and¬†come up with more advanced patterns and inputs for testing the API. You can leverage an AI-powered continuous testing process to more efficiently detect the controls that have changed.</p>
<h3>AI-based testing can&#8217;t do everything</h3>
<p>AI-based test automation of microservices can¬†create more reliable tests, and in so doing¬†slash the time needed for test creation, maintenance, and analysis. Such tests can in turn be used to check the service-to-service communication, test communication paths, etc.</p>
<p>You can also¬†leverage deep-learning¬†models and other AI techniques to empower your team to build tests faster and¬†execute¬†them at scale in the cloud.</p>
<p>Adopting AI for¬†microservices¬†test automation is no¬†panacea. It won&#8217;t magically eliminate all problems associated with software testing. But it can help you make your software testing process smarter, more efficient, and faster‚Äîand thereby deliver business value consistently.</p>
<h4>Keep learning</h4>
