										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>This year&#8217;s Amazon Prime Day may be delayed (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21266249/amazon-prime-day-2020-delayed-september-coronavirus-pandemic-shipping" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reportedly until August or September</a>), but when it does arrive, it is certain to bring with it the usual flood of web traffic from hungry shoppers looking for killer deals.</p>
<p>Now one of the biggest annual shopping bonanzas on the web—for Amazon, it&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://blogs.akamai.com/2019/07/amazon-prime-day-is-now-a-major-holiday-driving-up-traffic-by-more-than-14-in-the-us.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">bigger than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined</a>—Prime Day doesn&#8217;t just bring visitors flocking to Amazon. It also delivers an onslaught of traffic to other retailers, which wisely piggyback on Amazon with their own promotional activities. Last year, <a target="_blank" href="https://chainstoreage.com/technology/prime-day-not-just-for-amazon-250-retailers-to-offer-deals" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">more than 250 retailers</a> joined in, with their average revenue <a target="_blank" href="https://chainstoreage.com/technology/other-retailers-score-big-on-prime-day-but-some-department-stores-left-in-the-cold" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">jumping a whopping 68%</a> over the two days of the sale.</p>
<p>The bad news is that massive traffic spikes such as this <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/was-amazon-prime-day-intended-performance-test-production" rel="noopener noreferrer">can wreak havoc on your network</a> if you&#8217;re unprepared. The good news is that events such as Cyber Monday and Amazon Prime Day are announced well in advance, so <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/performance-reality-check-how-keep-unexpected-surges" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can plan for them accordingly</a>.</p>
<p>With Prime Day likely a couple of months away, you have plenty of time to get your network in order so the business can plan for the surge of visitors from a place of relative comfort. Here&#8217;s how.</p>
<p><em>[ Learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/enterprise-service-management-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to optimize your Enterprise Service Management</a> in TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide.

<h3>Cache is king</h3>
<p>Stephan Roussan, president of ICVM Group, a web development and hosting agency, , said his company&#8217;s client base included high-profile corporate clients who experience high-visibility events and have a very low tolerance for downtime. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Whenever we are preparing for an exponential traffic or load event, we start with a basic assessment.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/sroussan" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stephan Roussan</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That assessment asks a series of questions that are instructive to any enterprise preparing for a traffic surge, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the baseline health of the environment, and how much ceiling is currently available in terms of available resources?</li>
<li>Can you calculate the potential peak load and anticipate when it might occur? Will there be more than one peak? How long will the peaks last?</li>
<li>If the environment is already load-balanced, how often is it rolling over to secondary and tertiary instances? Is there a chance it will exhaust all resources?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to these questions help set a base understanding for capacity planning for the surge event.</p>
<p>As another safety measure, Roussan said, his firm will look to reschedule any processes that would normally be running during the event—such as backups and index builds. This will help minimize resource consumption during the spike. Disallowing spider and bot traffic during this time is another smart idea.</p>
<p>As a final tactic, Roussan said, he can&#8217;t overemphasize the importance of a smart caching regimen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Lengthen your cache life for the anticipated spike window. You can always dial it back afterwards.&#8221;<br />—Stephan Roussan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just make sure to be in close contact with your content publishing teams so that everyone is on the same page with regard to cache-flush protocol and any lag time relating to making content updates visible publicly, he advised.</p>
<h3>Test extensively and often</h3>
<p>The counterpart to planning is testing, and plenty of it. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/spoons/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Daniel Spoonhower</a>, CTO of performance management software developer Lightstep, said that part of being ready means testing—both software systems and your staff&#8217;s readiness. </p>
<p>Spoonhower recommends starting with a standard barrage of load testing. Use synthetic but realistic application loads to understand what services will fail first and what their breaking points are. He also suggests <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34603680/what-is-squeeze-testing" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">taking advantage of squeeze testing</a>—a newer tactic popularized by Netflix to determine the threshold at which a service &#8220;breaks&#8221; by gradually applying additional traffic in incremental steps.</p>
<p>And remember that testing also means testing your staff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Game-day testing provides a safe way for your staff to practice responding to events and ensure that they have the documentation, training, and processes necessary to respond quickly and confidently.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/spoons/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Daniel Spoonhower</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a similar note, scaling your services is easier <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/3-principles-infrastructure-code-what-every-manager-should-know" rel="noopener noreferrer">if you embrace infrastructure as code</a>, said Goutham Belliappa, Capgemini&#8217;s vice president of AI engineering, so you can use simple, automated mechanisms to add capacity.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t want to leave 10 times your normal infrastructure idling and accruing charges when it’s not needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Build in auto-scaling code routines that are thoroughly tested, and don&#8217;t forget to test the throttle-down routines.&#8221; <br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/GBELLIAP" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Goutham Belliappa</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Belliappa added that you should really double down on your worst-case scenarios when performing <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/end-end-vs-contract-based-testing-how-choose" rel="noopener noreferrer">end-to-end testing</a>. If you think your surge will be 10 times your monthly peak volume, push your system to 100 times so you can understand and remediate points of fragility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t thoroughly test your infrastructure and ecosystem, you are planning to fail.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Prepare for the worst</h3>
<p>Despite all the planning and testing, even the most robust of systems are going to fail sometime. Last year, both Costco and Nordstrom experienced online <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/costco-nordstrom-rack-sites-crash-with-black-friday-sales-2019-11" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">outages during Black Friday</a>, sending thousands of potential shoppers to the competition. The solution to this is to have a strong contingency plan in place that ensures you can get back up and running quickly should a system fail.</p>
<p>When experiencing a dramatic change in input such as e-commerce platforms often see on major shopping holidays, the main risk is that a set of unforeseen errors can quickly cascade across the environment, leading to systemic failure, said <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/talws/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tal Weiss</a>, CTO of OverOps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;At that point, what began as a local surge of errors in one or more services or components can rapidly begin to generate errors in downstream or dependent services.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/talws/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tal Weiss</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The challenge in responding to a failure event such as this, Weiss said, is to determine which of the errors that you&#8217;re experiencing are new. In a scenario where literally millions of alerts could be flooding the system at once, only a handful may be relevant to finding a solution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Your team will need to have a process in place to proactively establish a baseline ahead of the surge, as well as the right set of tools to fingerprint and map errors to their code location and alert based on deviations.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Consider outsourcing the problem</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-apm-tools-can-help-predict-prepare-traffic-spikes" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planning for a traffic surge</a> is an incredibly complex endeavor, and if your organization doesn&#8217;t have the necessary skills and tools, you can quickly find yourself in over your head.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emazingbrian/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Brian Lim</a> is CEO of EmazingGroup, which sells club and festival outfits and accessories. He <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/132783196" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">appeared on <i>Shark Tank</i> in 2015</a> to pitch EmazingLights, lighted gloves designed for the rave scene. Well aware of the date and time when the show would air, Lim knew in advance when traffic would hit the company&#8217;s website almost down to the minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew that being featured on a highly viewed television show would attract quite a bit of website traffic,&#8221; said Lim. In the six months leading up to the episode&#8217;s air date, the company purchased 30 servers, simulated load tests, and invested over $500,000 to make sure the site could handle the massive influx of traffic that would be coming their way.</p>
<p>But when the episode aired, the site went down anyway, he said.</p>
<p>Lim said he considers the company&#8217;s choice of platforms, originally built on a Magento backbone, a &#8220;near fatal&#8221; error.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;A lot of money was lost that day, and it made what should have been one of the happiest days one of the worst.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emazingbrian/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Brian Lim</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To solve the problem, EmazingGroup surrendered, dropping its DIY e-commerce ambitions and moving everything to a hosted site on Shopify.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Our lives have been made immeasurably easier, and we likely would never have had this issue if we had been with Shopify from the beginning. But we didn&#8217;t let that situation sink our company. The experience was a great reminder to focus on our products and marketing above all other business functions as an e-commerce brand.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Learn from the big fish</h3>
<p>What can you learn from such mega-traffic events and the planning that goes into them? Follow their lead and adapt at an appropriate level for your online services, and you will be one step ahead. After all, customers consider performance to be a primary reflection on your brand.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In a previous blog post, you have seen how to get started with the brand new TestProject Python SDK and]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a previous <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/getting-started-with-testproject-python-sdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, you have seen how to get started with the brand new <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a> Python SDK and add the power of the TestProject platform to your existing Selenium-based tests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/testproject-python-sdk/0.63.13/" rel="noopener noreferrer">version 0.63.13</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Python SDK can also be used with your Appium-based tests. In this blog post, you’ll see exactly how to do that.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f40d.png" alt="🐍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Register for <a target="_blank" href="https://tricentis.zoom.us/webinar/register/6515948566289/WN_ro4hpAZ4SdaNBmUSPeje5A" rel="noopener noreferrer">this free webinar</a> I’m hosting all about the new Python SDK, Tuesday, July 28th </strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f40d.png" alt="🐍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SDK supports both mobile web and native app tests, for Android as well as for iOS. We’re going to take a look at two examples:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mobile web test on Android and Chrome, using an emulator</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A native iOS app test, using a real device</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Running mobile web tests on Android using an emulator</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m going to assume that you have already downloaded the Python SDK, have configured your Agent and developer token, and that your Agent is running. If not, you can read how to do that in this <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/getting-started-with-testproject-python-sdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>. Also, I’m going to assume that you already have created and started an emulator running Android.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take this test as an example:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="python">import pytest

from appium import webdriver
from tests.pageobjects.web import LoginPage, ProfilePage


@pytest.fixture
def driver():

    desired_capabilities = {
        "udid": "emulator-5554",
        "browserName": "chrome",
        "platformName": "Android",
    }

    driver = webdriver.Remote(desired_capabilities=desired_capabilities)
    yield driver
    driver.quit()


def test_example_on_chrome_on_android(driver):

    LoginPage(driver).open().login_as("John Smith", "12345")

    profile_page = ProfilePage(driver)
    profile_page.update_profile(
        "United States",
        "Street name and number",
        "<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c5afaaadabebb6a8acb1ad85b6aaa8a0b2ada0b7a0ebb1a9a1" rel="noopener noreferrer">[email protected]</a>",
        "+1 555 555 55",
    )
    assert profile_page.saved_message_is_displayed() is True
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see from the defined </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">desired_capabilities</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this test runs on an emulator with name </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">emulator-5554</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;">,  which runs Android. Specifying a browser name, i.e., </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">chrome</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;">, indicates that we’re running a mobile web test.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To turn this Appium test into a TestProject-powered test, similar to <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/getting-started-with-testproject-python-sdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium-based tests</a>, all you need to do is change this import statement:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">from appium import webdriver
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">from src.testproject.sdk.drivers import webdriver
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and you’re good to go. Plus: you don’t need to run your own Appium server anymore, as the TestProject Agent acts as an Appium server for you!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you run this test, it will start a Chrome browser on your Android emulator and run the test:</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><noscript><img class="alignnone wp-image-13353 size-full" title="TestProject Python SDK - Chrome browser on your Android emulator" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_1.png" alt="TestProject Python SDK - Chrome browser on your Android emulator" width="480" height="861" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_1.png 480w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_1-285x512.png 285w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"/></noscript></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the test has finished executing, the SDK sends reports to the Agent, which will, in turn, create a new test report on the TestProject platform:</span></p>

<h2><strong>Running native app tests on iOS using a real device</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you’ve read earlier, the TestProject Python SDK supports both Android and iOS. Let’s take a look at an example test that tests a native iOS app running on a real iPhone:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">import pytest

from src.testproject.sdk.drivers import webdriver
from tests.pageobjects.android import LoginPage, ProfilePage


@pytest.fixture
def driver():

    desired_capabilities = {
        "udid": "&lt;my_device_udid_here&gt;",
        "deviceName": "iPhone van Bas",
        "browserName": "",
        "platformName": "iOS",
        "bundleId": "io.testproject.Demo",
    }

    driver = webdriver.Remote(desired_capabilities=desired_capabilities)

    yield driver

    driver.close_app()
    driver.quit()


def test_example_on_native_ios_app(driver):

    LoginPage(driver).login_as("John Smith", "12345")

    profile_page = ProfilePage(driver)

    profile_page.update_profile(
        "United States",
        "Street name and number",
        "<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9df7f2f5f3b3eef0f4e9f5ddeef2f0f8eaf5f8eff8b3e9f1f9" rel="noopener noreferrer">[email protected]</a>",
        "+1 555 555 55",
    )

    assert profile_page.saved_message_is_displayed() is True
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no browser specified in the </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">desired_capabilities</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which means that this test is running against a native app. Here’s a screenshot from the actual iOS device used, taken during test execution:</span></p>

TestProject enables you to run tests on <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/01/29/setup-ios-test-automation-windows-without-mac/" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS devices without the need for running macOS or XCode</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and without having to run an Appium server yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This test, too, passes, as we can see in the reports that are sent to TestProject:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13356 size-full" title="TestProject Reports" alt="TestProject Reports" width="1567" height="526" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_4.png 1567w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_4-512x172.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_4-768x258.png 768w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_4-1024x344.png 1024w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1567px) 100vw, 1567px" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_4.png"/></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, using the TestProject Python SDK (or the  <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/java-sdk" rel="noopener noreferrer">Java</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/c-sdk" rel="noopener noreferrer">C#</a> SDK), you can easily transform your existing Appium-based tests to TestProject-powered tests, no matter if they are for Android or iOS, using an emulator or a real device, testing mobile web or a native app, on macOS, Linux and Windows.</span></p>
<p><strong>Share your experience in the comments below. </strong><strong>Happy PyTesting!</strong> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f40d.png" alt="🐍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

					<description><![CDATA[After determining your project scope and requirements, use this guide to create a request for proposal (RFP) to send to]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>After determining your project scope and requirements, use this guide to create a request for proposal (RFP) to send to the vendors on your list.</p>
<p>Here we&#8217;ve compiled a list of questions that you might want to include in your RFP. Use this list as a guide and trim away the pieces you don&#8217;t need. Try to limit your product-related questions to those that are critical to your organization and keep it short, but complete. </p>
<p>The reason: When you send lengthy lists of product requirements to vendors, you&#8217;ll get back lengthy responses that are virtually impossible to compare. Focus on your top 10 requirements, and you will find it much easier to contrast vendors and make an informed decision.</p>
<p>When evaluating the vendor responses, consider assigning weightings to the requirements to ensure that your most important requirements are ranked highest as you score the candidates.</p>
<p><em>[ How important is DX to your org? <a target="_blank" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DX00?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Take our survey</a> and find out how you stand next to the competition. Plus: <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/digital-transformation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get up to speed on digital transformation</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide. ]</em></p>
<h3>Introduce yourself—provide a statement of your current status</h3>
<h4>Statement of goals, concerns, and objectives</h4>
<ul>
<li>Describe your service management automation goals, the problems you are trying to solve, and any relevant metrics you are hoping to improve.</li>
<li>State the greatest concerns for company management relative to service management, customer satisfaction, digital transformation, and business efficiency, and explain how you expect this tool to contribute.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Describe your interoperability requirements in detail</h4>
<ul>
<li>List the tools you have, and note your preference for a tool with the specific APIs you need for things like configuration, infrastructure, and monitoring. Ask vendors to comment about interoperability in those three areas.</li>
<li>Ask how much effort it will take to integrate their product with your toolset using their APIs/openAPI.</li>
<li>Provide an inventory of the kind of data (often bi-directional) you need to support, and ask them to explain in detail what their product can do in those areas.</li>
<li>Ask how their tools interoperate with cloud-native apps.</li>
<li>Ask how their tools capture information from the cloud.</li>
<li>Ask how easy it is to switch between cloud-based and on-premises services.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Request specific details about ease of use</h4>
<p>Today&#8217;s ESM buyers are looking for products that are less complicated to implement, upgrade, license, and maintain, particularly in light of the many integrations needed to make enterprise services flow properly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask how much effort is required to implement and maintain their product.</li>
<li>Ask how much effort is needed to upgrade to a new version, including all of the integrations that have been implemented.</li>
<li>Ask them to describe their approach to licensing and license management.</li>
<li>If you are having problems with the products you already own, describe how they are falling short—how they create too much work for your team or what capabilities they lack—and explain what you expect a new solution to provide.</li>
<li>Be transparent about what you don&#8217;t have and why you think it will help you to have it. Vendors and service providers can be valuable partners, so be frank about the issues you face with your current tools. They may surprise you with fresh ideas and strategies.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Statement of resources</h4>
<ul>
<li>Explain the job titles and skillsets of the people who will use the tool.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Infrastructure requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>List the main elements of your environment that are relevant to the tool usage:</li>
<li>Operating systems</li>
<li>Hardware</li>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>DevOps frameworks/pipeline</li>
<li>Cloud strategy</li>
</ul>
<h3>Vendor information</h3>
<p>Here are sample questions to ask the vendors. Our list covers a lot of ground, but you probably won&#8217;t need to ask all of them in your RFP. If you don’t have a mainframe, for example, there’s no need to ask about that. Trim this list as required to meet your needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your company, history, and ITSM/ESM focus?</li>
<li>Who is the primary contact for sales? Who is the primary contact for technical questions?</li>
<li>Do you have reference customers that can be contacted?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Products and capabilities</h4>
<p>This section helps you understand the product, the vendor&#8217;s approach to service management, and any innovations the vendor offers.</p>
<ul>
<li>List your product or products and the primary category of each.</li>
<li>List the scope of operations the tool was designed for.</li>
<li>What kinds of skills are required to use this tool?</li>
<li>What browsers do you support?</li>
<li>What devices do you support?</li>
<li>What platforms do you support?</li>
<li>Can your product handle services that are provided by mainframe apps?</li>
<li>Which continuous integration/continuous delivery tools do you support?</li>
<li>How easy is it to integrate your product with the other tools I currently use?</li>
<li>How easy is it to extend your product?</li>
<li>What types of reporting and analytics capabilities does the product provide? Is integration with a third-party reporting tool required for minimum reporting?</li>
<li>What are the features or innovations that differentiate you from your competitors?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Deployment, updates, and support</h4>
<ul>
<li>Is your product or service offered on-premises, as a cloud service, or as a hybrid solution?</li>
<li>Does deployment require a consulting engagement?</li>
<li>Do you offer guided consulting to assist during implementation?</li>
<li>How often do you release new versions or update the software?</li>
<li>Do you offer support? What are the terms of your support contracts?</li>
<li>What training options do you offer?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>There has never been a better time to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/8-steps-get-started-enterprise-service-management" rel="noopener noreferrer">get started with ESM</a>, or to expand your ESM footprint. The vendor market has solidified, the benefits are increasingly obvious, and the tools are getting easier to use. Most importantly, some of your competitors are probably already using ESM in some areas and will continue to exploit that competitive edge over you until you enter the game.</p>
<p>Done right, ESM can become the platform for your organization’s back-office digital transformation. Back-office operations are often overlooked in the drive to achieve digital transformation. But when companies fail to address the operational side, they haven’t really transformed the business.</p>
<p>As a 2019 World Economic Forum paper said: &#8220;Customer engagement is essential, great product and services are mandatory, and an innovative economic model may be table stakes, but without operations all of that fails.&#8221; In some cases, &#8220;Back-office actually becomes front-office, as non-IT departments expose their services to their employees and customers, which in turn, requires them to become service-centric organizations,&#8221; said Pott.</p>
<p>Get started today. Using the information and guidance in this document, assemble a team with the right players, step with them through the fundamental considerations, and get a viable ESM project underway. With the right sponsor, team, and ESM technologies in place, you&#8217;ll embark on a journey of continuous improvement that will keep your organization competitive and add value to the entire business for many years to come.</p>
<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>Try to limit your product-related questions to those that are critical to your organization and keep it short. When you send lengthy lists of product requirements to vendors, you&#8217;ll get back lengthy responses that are virtually impossible to compare.</li>
<li>In the RFP, include your goals, concerns, and objectives.</li>
<li>Spell out your interoperability requirements in detail; include your current tools and an inventory of the data you need to support.</li>
<li>Get information about maintenance and support, as well as license requirements.</li>
<li>Find out about the vendor; ask about company history, primary sales/support contacts, and customer references.</li>
<li>Get details about the product&#8217;s features, functions, scope, platforms supported, and how easy or difficult it would be to extend or customize.</li>
<li>Get going! Done correctly, ESM can become the platform for your organization&#8217;s back-office digital transformation.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Create Strong Passwords with a Password Generator Whether you use the internet for several hours every day or only browse]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<h2><strong>Create Strong Passwords with a Password Generator</strong></h2>
<p>Whether you use the internet for several hours every day or only browse it on occasion, you have likely created numerous accounts on streaming services, financial services, and online storefronts like Amazon. Many of these accounts contain highly sensitive information. Hackers can get into online accounts and computers by guessing passwords, which means that your personal information would be available to them if you use a weak password.</p>
<p>To effectively protect your accounts from being hacked, it’s important that you have a strong password with each account that you create. However, it can be difficult to think of the perfect password that will keep your account safe from any hacker. To that end, there are many ways to create strong passwords, the primary of which is through a password generator. This article goes into detail about the importance of using good passwords and how to create them.</p>
<h3><strong>Importance of Having a Strong Password</strong></h3>
<p>Whenever you purchase an item online, you will be required to enter some financial information, which can include your bank account or credit card number. Many individuals may make the mistake of saving their financial information to the account because of how convenient it is. When you need to purchase an item in the future, you won’t need to go through the hassle of reentering your credit card information. The problem with saving your financial info to your account is that hackers who get into your account will have automatic access to the information at hand.</p>
<h3><strong>Website Security Measures Also Benefit from Strong Passwords</strong></h3>
<p>While website security has become increasingly strong over the past decade or so, the security measures that a site owner takes don’t matter if a hacker is able to get into your account by guessing your password, which is why it’s essential that you create a strong password that will hold up to hacking attempts.</p>
<h3><strong>Weak Passwords can Lead to Many Problems</strong></h3>
<p>Without a strong password, you run the risk of experiencing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">identity theft</a> or financial fraud, both of which can significantly damage your finances and livelihood if the issue isn’t corrected immediately. Keep in mind that some of the more popular passwords in the country include 123456, password, 111111, qwerty, and abc123. Because of how popular these passwords are, they are some of the first that hackers will use to attempt to get into an account.</p>
<h3><strong>Hackers Can Control Your Entire Account</strong></h3>
<p>Once a hacker has breached your account, they can do a variety of things. The primary of which involves aquiring financial information that can be found in your account. These individuals can also choose to make purchases with this account or send in requests for new credit cards under your name. Along with stealing your own money, it’s possible for hackers to ruin your credit, which could take years to remedy.</p>
<h3><strong>Hackers Could Breach Your Computer</strong></h3>
<p>It’s important to understand that hackers can also get into your computer. Though more difficult, hackers can access documents and personal information on your computer if they are able to guess the password to your operating system. Many people store the passwords that they use in a document that’s stored on their computer, which is done with the belief that a hacker will never get into the computer itself. In the event that a hacker gains access to your device, they would be able to read the document where your passwords are stored. While having a strong password doesn’t eliminate the possibility of being hacked, it will make it much more difficult for someone to gain access to your computer or online accounts.</p>
<h3><strong>Using a Password Generator</strong></h3>
<p>If you need to store important personal or financial information online or on your computer, it’s essential that you pair your devices and accounts with strong passwords that will hold up to hacking attempts. Even though you can create lengthy and strong passwords without any assistance, keep in mind that the average U.S. citizen has around 25-30 accounts that passwords are needed for. Attempting to identify the perfect password on your own and for each account that you create can be a time-consuming and laborious process. Password generators are designed to instantly provide you with passwords that should be very difficult to guess.</p>
<h3><strong>How Password Generators Work</strong></h3>
<p>While every password generator is somewhat unique, the best generators are ones that provide you with options on what you would like to include in the password. The majority of password generators will automatically create passwords that are at least 15 characters long, consist of symbols and numbers, and include uppercase and lowercase letters. However, certain generators also provide users with the ability to exclude similar and ambiguous characters from the password that’s generated. Once you have generated a password, all that’s left is for you to input it into the account you’re currently creating. Password generators are simple to use and can make your life easier as you attempt to keep your personal information safe and secure.</p>
<h3><strong>Extra Features to Look For in Password Generator</strong></h3>
<p>Password generators can come with many extra features that could prove helpful in keeping your accounts and computer secure. For instance, some services provide users with a master password, which means that all of your passwords and secure information are kept under a single password that only you know. Some tools also allow users to set the exact length of the password, which could consist of anywhere from 8-100 characters. Additional features to be on the lookout for include unlimited password storage, 24/7 support, and custom security controls.</p>
<h3><strong>McAfee True Key Features</strong></h3>
<p>One potential password manager and generator you can use is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.truekey.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee True Key</a>, which is designed to create very lengthy and strong passwords. Some of the core features of this particular tool include local data encryption, the support of numerous browsers, syncing across PC, Mac, iOS, and Android devices, and many different methods for signing in. For instance, you could pair the True Key app with the fingerprint reader on your device. You can also use the app to import any stored passwords from your browser.</p>
<h3><strong>How to Create a Strong Password</strong></h3>
<p>There are a myriad of things that you can do to create a strong password, the easiest of which is to use a password generator that will automatically provide you with a randomized password that will hold up well to hackers. While using a password generator is the most convenient option for creating a strong password, there are some additional tips and guidelines that you should keep in mind.</p>
<h3><strong>Primary Guidelines for Creating a Great Password</strong></h3>
<p>The main guidelines to keep in mind when creating a strong password include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your password is at least 7-8 characters long</li>
<li>Make sure that you never use a word or symbol for your password that can easily be found on any of your social media pages</li>
<li>Change each password you use at an interval or 90 days or less, which should also be done for any strong passwords you use</li>
<li>Use a combination of numbers, special characters, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters</li>
<li>Don’t use the same password for numerous accounts, which heightens the possibility that a breach into one of your accounts could lead to several accounts being compromised</li>
<li>Never write down your password on a piece of paper, which only serves to heighten the possibility of the password being seen by another individual and copied down</li>
<li>Consider using numbers and letters for your password that have no identifiable patterns within</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Stay protected</strong></h3>
<p>Passwords are essential for security and can help you keep your computer and online accounts safe from hackers. While financial fraud and cases of stolen identity may be able to be corrected without any lasting damage to your bank account or credit score, the hassle that comes with contacting banking institutions and fixing any issues pertaining to the hack is more than it’s worth. Even though the aforementioned tips should assist you in creating a strong password, it’s highly recommended that you use a password generator instead, which ensures that mistakes are avoided completely and that the passwords you use are secure.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Sauce Labs announced the release of our newest product to expand developer-first capabilities: Sauce Testrunner Toolkit. Currently]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>Earlier this year, Sauce Labs <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/blog/look-no-strings-puppeteer-jest-and-sauce-labs" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced the release</a> of our newest product to expand developer-first capabilities: <a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.saucelabs.com/testrunner-toolkit/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sauce Testrunner Toolkit</a>. Currently in a free beta, it makes setting up, writing, and running web tests easier and faster for developers during early pipeline testing. This is the first in a number of updates to our platform that empower developers with the tools they need to achieve quality at scale.</p>
<p>But to realize that goal, we understand that we must meet developers where they are from a tooling perspective. This is why we also revealed support for Puppeteer in the same announcement, and soon after added Playwright. Today our team is thrilled to announce that we have expanded support for two more “developer-focused” testing frameworks: Cypress and TestCafe!</p>
<h3>Introducing Cypress and TestCafe</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Cypress and TestCafe are open source testing frameworks for development teams. They contain tools that make it easy for developers to set up, write, run and debug tests. The Sauce Labs Testrunner Toolkit will create a containerized environment, so you can easily use these frameworks for quick test setup and execution without having to rely on any servers or drivers, and you never have to leave the terminal to achieve it!</p>
<p>For developers, using these frameworks really allows them to realize the benefits of early pipeline testing as quality shifts left, and take more ownership of the quality of the code they create. Using these frameworks in conjunction with Testrunner Toolkit provide even more value, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Accelerate release velocity</b> &#8211; Sauce Testrunner Toolkit allows for developers to execute tests on a preconfigured Docker container in Chrome and Firefox from their local machine. This allows for decreased testing times, instant feedback, and more productive developers, which in turn accelerates release speeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>CI Integrations</b> &#8211; with integrations via GitLab, GitHub, Travis or CircleCI, developers can also run tests in Testrunner Toolkit as part of their CI/CD pipeline. This allows them to plug tests into already-existing infrastructure, and avoids unnecessary load on their side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Debugging and Insights</b> &#8211; with access to the Sauce Labs platform, developers have the ability to pinpoint the reason for test failures with our suite of debugging tools (including video recordings, logs, and more). Combined with our Insights platform, which includes actionable data and recommendations to improve test efficiency, Sauce Labs provides a complete solution to help understand the quality of applications earlier in the software development lifecycle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>Testrunner Toolkit is easy to install, and is completely free! Here is a quick, 3-step setup guide straight from our <a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.saucelabs.com/testrunner-toolkit/" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>
<h4><b>Requirements</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker</a> installed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure the Docker daemon is running (e.g. docker info works in your terminal)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sauce Labs</a> account; if you don&#8217;t have one, start a <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/sign-up" rel="noopener noreferrer">free trial</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><b> Installing Testrunner Toolkit</b></h4>
<p>Using NPM:</p>
<pre><code>npm i -g saucectl</code></pre>
<p>You can also utilize our one line installer:</p>
<pre><code>curl -L https://saucelabs.github.io/saucectl/install | bash</code></pre>
<p>Would you like to inspect the content of our one line installer? Download it, have a look and execute it:</p>
<pre><code>curl -fsSL -o get_saucectl.sh  https://saucelabs.github.io/saucectl/install
chmod 700 get_saucectl.sh
./get_saucectl.sh</code></pre>
<h4><b>Connecting to Sauce Labs</b></h4>
<p>A Sauce Labs user name and access key are needed to post the test results. You can get your SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY from Account &gt; User Settings in <a target="_blank" href="https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sauce Labs</a>.</p>
<p>To authenticate yourself, the following environment variables need to be set:</p>
<pre><code>SAUCE_USERNAME</code></pre>
<pre><code>SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY</code></pre>
<p>You can export them as follows:</p>
<pre><code>export SAUCE_USERNAME=&lt;your-username&gt;</code></pre>
<pre><code>export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=&lt;your-access-key&gt;</code></pre>
<p>If you are using a cloud CI/CD tool, we strongly suggest protecting these values through secrets or context variables.</p>
<p>After setup, you can use the new <code>saucectl</code> run command to run your tests in any of the supported frameworks, and then view the results in your Sauce Labs accounts. Here is a brief demo of how that works (using Cypress):</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/1QA3Tvr6dg7YyFv9zu2kyX/1487d89686b77afc3c7b5716c1e20d35/cypress-poc-demo.gif" alt="Cypress demo" title="Cypress demo"/></p>
<p>To learn more about this, and how to run your first test, please reference the documentation on our <a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.saucelabs.com/testrunner-toolkit/" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repo</a>, or take a look at this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfSOejlKD0&amp;list=PL67l1VPxOnT4chA1dFFjTCEeAmRnfo_8V&amp;index=6" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo presentation</a> from SauceCon 2020.</p>
<h3>What’s Next</h3>
<p>Today, developers using Sauce Labs Testrunner Toolkit can run tests on a local machine or through their CI/CD pipeline, as well as view results in the Sauce Labs UI. This means tests can be executed in only the Chrome and Firefox versions shipped with the pre-configured container provided by Sauce. In our next iteration, you will be able to configure tests from Testrunner Toolkit to execute in our virtual desktop cloud environment. This will give you access to hundreds of browser and OS combinations, as well as the ability to scale your efforts by running tests in parallel. This comprehensive coverage, along with the scalability to accelerate code velocity, will help developers truly embrace quality without sacrificing speed.</p>
<h3>Try It For Yourself! </h3>
<p>Cypress and TestCafe are now both supported as a part of the Sauce Testrunner Toolkit beta, which is completely free! If you’d like to try it out for yourself, head over to our <a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.saucelabs.com/testrunner-toolkit/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github repo</a> where you can get started right away.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like all <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-sdk/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject SDKs</a>, the Python SDK executes tests using the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-agents/what-is-a-testproject-agent" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject Agent</a>. This Agent takes care of browser driver installation and configuration as well as reporting to the TestProject platform. You can download the Agent from <a target="_blank" href="https://app.testproject.io/#/agents" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By default, the SDK will communicate with the Agent on its default address, which is </span><a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:8585" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://localhost:8585</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you’re running the Agent on another port, or even an entirely different machine, you can configure the correct address by setting the </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">TP_AGENT_URL</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;"> environment variable to the correct address.</span></p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="dev-token-config" rel="noopener noreferrer">Configuring your developer token</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To communicate with the Agent, you need a developer token. You can configure the SDK to use it by obtaining a token from </span><a target="_blank" href="https://app.testproject.io/#/integrations/sdk" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://app.testproject.io/#/integrations/sdk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and setting an environment variable </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">TP_DEV_TOKEN</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the token value.</span></p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="first-test" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creating your first test</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After installing and setting up the SDK, it’s time to start writing our first test <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />Here is a fully functional example test that opens the <a target="_blank" href="https://example.testproject.io/web/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject demo application</a>, logs in and checks that a greeting message is displayed:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="python">from src.testproject.sdk.drivers import webdriver

def simple_test():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()

    driver.get("https://example.testproject.io/web/")

    driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#name").send_keys("John Smith")
    driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#password").send_keys("12345")
    driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#login").click()

    passed = driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#logout").is_displayed()

    print("Test passed") if passed else print("Test failed")

    driver.quit()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    simple_test()</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re already familiar with developing Selenium-based tests in Python, this code should not be difficult to understand. Let’s run it and see what happens! But first, make sure that your TestProject Agent is running. </span></p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="run-test" rel="noopener noreferrer">Running the test</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s assume that the example test we just saw resides in a Python module called </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">web_test.py</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since we made this module runnable using </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">if __name__ == “__main__”</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we can run this test simply by executing the following command:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="python">python web_test.py
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will request a Chrome driver instance from the TestProject Agent, run the tests and report results to the TestProject platform. If you configured your developer token and Agent address correctly, you’ll see the following output in your console, indicating that our test was executed successfully:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="python">&lt;...&gt;
Test passed
2020-07-13 09:30:03,884 INFO Connection to Agent at http://127.0.0.1:8585 closed successfully

Process finished with exit code 0
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at the reports that were generated.</span></p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="test-reports" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inspecting the test reports</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TestProject Agent will automatically report your test results to the TestProject platform. If you head over to </span><a target="_blank" href="https://app.testproject.io/#/reports" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://app.testproject.io/#/reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you’ll see a project called ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unnamed Project</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’:</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><noscript><img class="alignnone wp-image-13243 size-full" title="TestProject Python SDK - Generated Test Reports" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TestProject-Python-SDK-Generated-Test-Reports.png" alt="TestProject Python SDK - Generated Test Reports" width="612" height="336" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TestProject-Python-SDK-Generated-Test-Reports.png 612w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TestProject-Python-SDK-Generated-Test-Reports-512x281.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px"/></noscript></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you click on this, you’ll see an overview of the test runs associated with this project. This will contain a job called ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">web_test</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ (the job name is automatically derived from the Python module name) and a passed test called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘simple_test</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ (the test name is automatically derived from the test method name):</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, the test is marked as passed, and all the individual actions that were performed by the browser driver instance are reported to the right, all out of the box, without the need for additional configuration!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TestProject Python SDK offers you a variety of options to <strong>customize your reporting</strong>. We will take a closer look at those in a follow-up article (coming soon!). One thing that is worthy of mentioning here, though, is that values that are entered into password fields are automatically redacted, as you can see in step 5 of the report. This feature can also be switched off if desired. You’ll see how in the article on reporting coming soon. </span></p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="unit-testing" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supported unit testing frameworks</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the TestProject Python SDK supports the </span><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unittest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pytest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unit testing frameworks. If you have existing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unittest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">– or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pytest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-based Selenium tests, it is very easy to convert these to TestProject-powered tests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pytest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-based example. The process is exactly the same for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unittest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by the way:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="python">from selenium import webdriver
from tests.pageobjects.web import LoginPage, ProfilePage

def test_example_using_chrome():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    LoginPage(driver).open().login_as("John Smith", "12345")
    assert ProfilePage(driver).greetings_are_displayed() is True
    driver.quit()
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming that you have added the TestProject SDK as a dependency to your project, and that you have configured both the Agent and your developer token as described earlier in this article, the only thing you need to do to change this import statement:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="python">from selenium import webdriver
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">to this:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="python">from src.testproject.sdk.drivers import webdriver
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and you’re good to go. It is that easy! Now, let’s assume that this test is part of a module </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">example_test</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a package called </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">tests</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you run this test using:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="python">pytest testsexample_test.py
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and go to the TestProject reports page again, you’ll see a report that looks like this:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13247 size-full" title="TestProject Python SDK - Generated Test Reports" alt="TestProject Python SDK - Generated Test Reports" width="1552" height="530" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/second.png 1552w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/second-512x175.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/second-768x262.png 768w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/second-1024x350.png 1024w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1552px) 100vw, 1552px" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/second.png"/></p>
<p><noscript><img class="alignnone wp-image-13247 size-full" title="TestProject Python SDK - Generated Test Reports" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/second.png" alt="TestProject Python SDK - Generated Test Reports" width="1552" height="530" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/second.png 1552w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/second-512x175.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/second-768x262.png 768w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/second-1024x350.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1552px) 100vw, 1552px"/></noscript></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, the SDK has automatically derived the test name (‘</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">test_example_using_chrome’</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and the job name (‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>example_test</em>‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">), from the test method name and the package name, respectively. Additionally, if you’re using </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pytest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unittest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the SDK will also automatically infer a project name based on the package that the test modules are in. The project, job and test names can also be customized if you like. You will see how to do that in the reporting article coming soon – Stay tuned for that <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="summary" rel="noopener noreferrer">Summary</strong></h2>
