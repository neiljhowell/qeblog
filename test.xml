<div>
<p>Incorporating analytics into the enterprise toolkit can be straightforward or complex, relatively inexpensive or a multimillion-dollar initiative. It all depends on what you want to accomplish.</p>
<p>Analytics is simply a set of practices designed to aid analysis. It can be as basic as creating a paper report that shows monthly snowfall in a particular region, a spreadsheet that uses formulas to calculate entries from columns A and F and then write the results to column Y, or the results of far more complex methods of data reading, sorting, and discovery. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/guide-to-modern-data-warehouse-tb/share-bi-resources?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign= 00174153" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big data analytics</a>, a subset of analytics overall, is about the process of managing and investigating large datasets, typically stored in a repository such as a data warehouse or data store. These may reside on one or more public clouds or on an organization&#8217;s own on-premises hardware.</p>
<p>The sources of that data can be nearly any kind of system. Traditionally, these sources provide structured data as <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/node/3949" rel="noopener noreferrer">described in this story</a>, including transactional (sales-related) data such as point of sale, inventory, customer relationship management, and records from related systems. Structured data also includes information from IT operational systems and machine data from sources such as remote sensors and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-tame-iot-guide-it-ops" rel="noopener noreferrer">other aspects of the Internet of Things</a>.</p>
<p>Less traditional is the storage of unstructured data for analytical purposes. Unstructured data—photos, video, audio, etc.—has been considered viable for analysis only over the past 15 years or so.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to know to start to make sense of all of your data.</p>

<h3>The modes of data query and analysis</h3>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt">Regardless of the data type, you store it to eventually learn what it may reveal. And you need an analytics process to help make sense of what&#8217;s there by asking questions that a database can interpret. This involves writing a query, done via a language that a database understands, such as SQL (Structured Query Language).</p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt"> </p>
<p>Querying a database via SQL long predates the big data phenomenon. SQL database vendors in the early &#8217;90s made it easier than it had been before for businesses to use SQL to understand trends in their acquired data. Another piece of this was also to create stored procedures that external applications could use to automate processing of back-end data storage and end-user results.</p>
<p>Nowadays, a big data query can certainly be an ad hoc question, because a business user might want to know how many bicycles he has sold to medium-income buyers in Illinois during the month of October.</p>
<h4><strong>Setting up standard queries</strong></h4>
<p>But a big data query is not always a &#8220;question&#8221; in the traditional sense of one that occurs to an analyst to ask relative to some emerging situation. Often, queries are set up to work automatically for routine reporting, or as some event triggers the need for analyzing the data on hand and producing some behavior.</p>
<p>In other words, standard queries can be set up to produce reports on a regular basis, for inventory and supply chain correlations, or about any number of routine operating statistics.</p>
<p>But standard queries can be set up for dynamic situations as well. Say a customer comes to your site and begins clicking on the images and high-level descriptions of bicycles you have for sale. A single click on a bike&#8217;s name and photo will take the customer to more details about the particular product.</p>
<p>But that same click can cause a variety of related items to display in the margins of the page—helmets, toe clips, side packs, lights, and other accessories. Most of us have experienced this kind of automated behavior when interacting with a commercial web page.</p>
<p>In this example, a user&#8217;s click on a specific bike triggers a preset query that&#8217;s designed to read a database of related items and display those items for the user to consider. Simple enough.</p>
<p>Now, imagine this is a returning customer, George, and you have some data accumulated on him—one or more items he&#8217;s bought in the past, or items he moved to the shopping cart but didn&#8217;t purchase, or any items clicked on during past site visits. In this case, you have even more intelligence regarding what to display in your margins for George.</p>
<p>That means your preset query not only returns items related to George&#8217;s current search, but items that specifically match his past behavior, and possibly his continued interest.</p>
<h3>Analytics&#8217; role in tracking consumer behavior</h3>
<p>Keeping track of consumer behavior is how video or music services make movie and song recommendations for you. Netflix, for example, uses prior data from customers to provide you with these kinds of educated guesses. It&#8217;s also how your favorite outdoor-gear retailer &#8220;knows&#8221; that you&#8217;re more likely to purchase clothing than climbing equipment, for instance, and therefore sends you targeted email when it begins a two-week sale.</p>
<p>In all cases, some system is running in the background, making recommendations for users based on accumulated data, predicting likely patterns of behavior, and adjusting offerings based on further data that the system gathers as the user browses the website in response to an email campaign.</p>
<p>Being able to set up this sort of cause-and-effect sequence of likely consumer paths is essential to intelligent business operations. But speed is also a major factor, since the faster a system can respond to these events—e.g., a click here, returning a new display there—the faster a business can act on that insight.</p>
<p>When you compare that capability to what happens on a static web page, where just the details of a bike the user clicks on get displayed, you see the opportunities that a more dynamic, data-driven process can create for the site owner.</p>
<p><em>[ How important is DX to your org? <a target="_blank" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DX00?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Take our survey</a> and find out how you stand next to the competition. Plus: <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/digital-transformation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get up to speed on digital transformation</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide. ]</em></p>
<h3>Why more data is always better</h3>
<p>Big data analytics can also show previously unrecognized patterns based not just on buying habits, but also on equipment failure rates, <a target="_blank" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/sentiment-analysis-concept-analysis-and-applications-6c94d6f58c17" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sentiment analysis</a> of massive volumes of text messages, or health indicators such as heart rate and blood pressure. The more data, the more correlations between various factors you can verify and use to predict and achieve the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Understanding consumer behavior and how to respond is one thing. Businesses can also please customers and help ensure repeat business by understanding their own operational needs and dependencies.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a simple example: Suppose you operate a pizza delivery business that supports multiple restaurants in a given area. Depending on geography, driving times based on traffic patterns vary throughout the day, from morning to midday to evening rush hour. Ideally, you can analyze where driving complexities lie during certain times of day. Google can provide basic route data, and estimate time to delivery.</p>
<p>But an accumulation of local data—based on knowledge of road construction work, current traffic conditions, and alternative routes—can allow you to get more specific. You might learn, say, that there are delivery times of plus or minus five minutes for some restaurants, and you can advise your customers accordingly.</p>
<p>You can also incorporate weather data: What&#8217;s the forecast? Those adjustments can allow more accurate delivery-time predictions. Without a big data analytics tool, you can&#8217;t predict your delivery time with much accuracy.</p>
<h3>Common modes of analytics</h3>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt">The key word in the previous paragraph is &#8220;predict.&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/3-ways-put-predictive-analytics-work-it-ops" rel="noopener noreferrer">Predictive analytics</a> is the art and science of probability-based data assessment and decision making. But it isn&#8217;t the only type of analysis that big data techniques can help with. </p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt"> </p>
<h4><strong>Descriptive analytics</strong></h4>
<p>This data set &#8220;describes&#8221; a state or condition that needs to be understood. One simple example: a printed report that shows how many trucks within a fleet of vehicles are available for deployment next Thursday. Electronic dashboards showing system throughput and computational workloads across a business&#8217;s IT environment is another; this uses data to help IT teams balance the loads properly and reduce bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Returning to the bicycle website example, when George 1) clicks on a bike image, and 2) all he gets is a set of details about that particular model, such as the average customer rating, that&#8217;s another example of descriptive analytics.</p>
<p>This sort of user experience is little more than a hierarchical display of goods for sale—a report, in a sense—with higher-level elements (bike photo, name, price) leading to lower-level elements (specifications, construction details, colors). This is certainly helpful information, but it&#8217;s not nearly the extent of what can be accomplished with data. </p>
<p>To be clear, descriptive analytics is extremely useful in some circumstances. It can help pinpoint what is wrong in a given situation so that corrective steps might be taken. When you feel sick and visit a doctor, you expect the doctor to know what to do about your condition so you&#8217;ll feel better.</p>
<p>As long as your condition can be described and it&#8217;s nothing out of the ordinary, it&#8217;s likely something that can be fairly easily diagnosed. For instance, your blood pressure can be compared against others in your age group, your doctor can show you the average (mean) statistics, and either assure you all is well or advise a new regimen to improve your numbers.</p>
<h4>Predictive analytics</h4>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/predictive-analytics-vs-ai-why-difference-matters" rel="noopener noreferrer">This type of analytics</a> is designed to predict an upcoming event, or at least understand the probability of something occurring. As such, it gives you a powerful tool for succeeding in a specific endeavor. In e-commerce, for example, the ability to predict your customers&#8217; buying habits based on known patterns is a great way to plan for your next steps.</p>
<p>If George, your prospective bike purchaser, is a returning customer, great. You know something about his buying habits, his preferences, and his decision-making process. But even if George is a new customer, the data you&#8217;ve retained from all your other customers can keep George interested and more likely to buy from you, or at least return at some later date. How does that work?</p>
<p>This requires you to build a predictive model<em>,</em> based on buckets of customer information acquired over months or years of interaction with bicycle customers. If George comes to the site and you have a collection of data that fits his demographics, what do customers like him typically buy? Can you assign a score to George based on his apparent interests and offer him something that has proved successful with other customers at his interest level?</p>
<p>If you have hundreds of customers like him, you have the basis for a model to use for displaying the accessories discussed earlier, plus other bikes, plus any number of elements from your retail bag of tricks that might keep him browsing. There are no guarantees, of course. But a user experience based on predictive analytics is clearly superior to one based on simple descriptive analytics.</p>
<h3>Use predictive models to manage the unknown </h3>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s a great thing about big data analytics: There are patterns lurking within the data that you&#8217;re likely not even aware of but that you can possibly discover and put to work. That&#8217;s where predictive analytics based on truly big data comes into play.</p>
<p>In the bike website example, the datasets amassed over time might not be huge, but they have helped you and your team understand some essential patterns that reveal buying behavior, including some patterns that describe a customer who is not interested. When you apply those same patterns to truly large datasets and use a system that can identify similar correlations between one activity and another, wholly new patterns that can lead to success may become evident.</p>
<p>Simply put, patterns are maps to behavior, human or otherwise. But why does it matter?</p>
<p>Imagine being able to sort through hundreds of thousands of details from your sales transactions to discover whether or not men in Canada between the ages of 25 and 40 tend to buy your thicker, dark socks in October. You do some correlations, and you find out—no! They tend to buy brighter colors during that month.</p>
<p>You can now run a sale and web promotion on those items—and watch your sales increase by 30%. You can add more variables, too, and test theories about buying habits based on income range or seasonal conditions. Is this going to be a harsh winter? Will that increase the probability of my sock sales or not?</p>
<h3>Removing some of the guesswork</h3>
<p>You might argue this is just an example of the educated guesswork that businesses have used for years, and you might be right. But big data analytics can take guesswork out of the picture when you encounter situations such as this.</p>

<div>
<p>At Applitools, we have tutorials showing you how to integrate Applitools with commonly-used CICD orchestration engines. You can already link Applitools with Jenkins, Travis, CircleCI. Each of these orchestration engines can automatically launch visual validation with Applitools as part of a build process.</p>
<p>What about GitHub Actions?</p>
<h2 id="h.jodcredoby3z">What is “GitHub Actions”?</h2>
<p>GitHub Actions is an API for cause and effect on GitHub: orchestrate any workflow, based on any event, while GitHub manages the execution, provides rich feedback and secures every step along the way. With GitHub Actions, workflows and steps are just code in a repository, so you can create, share, reuse, and fork your software development practices.</p>
<p>GitHub Actions makes it easier to automate how you build, test, and deploy your projects on any platform, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. This provides Fast CI/CD for any OS, any language, and any cloud!</p>
<p>Applitools provides automated Visual AI testing. It is easy to integrate Applitools with GitHub Actions, letting developers to test their code by running visual tests using GitHub Actions workflow.</p>
<p>For this article, I have chosen a Cypress automation project that has a single visual test with Applitools created before in my GitHub repo:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/satishapplitools/Cypress-Applitools-GitActions.git" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/satishapplitools/Cypress-Applitools-GitActions.git</a></p>
<h2 id="h.2byz9zbm85s6">Configuring GitHub Actions workflow on the repository</h2>
<p>Click on Actions tab in GitHub repository</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"></figure>
</div>
<p>GitHub Actions has an option to choose from several starter workflows based on programming languages, tools, technologies, and deployment options. Workflow prepares a YAML file at the end.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image16.png" alt="image16" class="wp-image-20240" width="947" height="385" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image16.png 1347w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image16-300x122.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image16-1024x417.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image16-768x313.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px"/></figure>
</div>
<p>For this article, I have chosen, “<em>Skip this and set up a workflow yourself</em>” to use an existing YAML file.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image3-1.png" alt="image3 1" class="wp-image-20244" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image3-1.png 883w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image3-1-300x68.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image3-1-768x174.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px"/></figure>
</div>
<p>If you want to follow along, do the same. I named my file main.yaml.  Copy the following code and paste the content into your Yaml file.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/batmi02/df7b1b1ba6cca79add3df6d6001aa73d.js</p>
</div>
<p>For Applitools integration, we require Applitools API Key and pass Git Commit SHA as Applitools Batch ID.  In the code example above, I have set up the Applitools API key as GitHub secrets and that can be passed as a call to an environment variable in the GitHub Actions workflow (as shown below). To know more about GitHub Actions secrets click <a target="_blank" href="https://secrethub.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">secret hub</a>,</p>

<h2 id="h.xkvkips19gd8">Run Git Hub Actions workflow integrated with Applitools</h2>
<p>Now it’s time to run the integration.  Here are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let us create a new branch from master and name it as “feature branch”.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Make some changes in the feature branch and create a pull request to the master branch.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>GitHub Actions workflow understands there are changes made on the code, and it automatically kicks off the workflow and runs Cypress tests integrated with Applitools(as shown below)</li>
</ul>

            </div>
<p>Happy Birthday! Today we mark the fourth anniversary of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nomoreransom.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">NoMoreRansom</a> initiative with over 4.2 million visitors, from 188 countries, stopping an estimated $632 million in ransom demands from ending up in criminals’ pockets. It would be fair to say that the initiative, which started in a small meeting room in the Hague, has been integral for so many in the perpetual fight against cybercriminals.</p>
<p>Powered by the contributions of its 163 partners the portal, which is available in 36 languages, has added 28 tools in the past year and can now decrypt 140 different types of ransomware infection. To think, just four years ago we started with only a handful of decryptors and partners. That speaks volumes to the commitment by all members to collaborate and work together to give victims a third option; #DontPay.</p>
<p>All this hard work took place in an ever-changing cybercriminal landscape; during those four years ransomware criminals shifted their tactics from “spray and pay”, mostly aimed at consumers, to highly organized crime groups actively seeking to paralyze complete organizations and extort them for astronomical amounts of money.</p>
<p>These challenges have not discouraged NoMoreRansom and its partners; on the contrary, having a strong public private partnership between Law Enforcement and the Private sector has proven essential in several (ongoing) investigations. Without a doubt, we will be the first to admit that fighting ransomware has not been easy but that should not stop us from doing things that are hard.</p>
<p>We are delighted to continue supporting this initiative and play our part in fighting this global problem. However, we have to stress that the fight against ransomware is far from over, in fact we need more collaborative initiatives to combat the rise in malicious activity.  Also, there are still many individuals and organizations that do not even know about NoMoreRansom. Even within the information security industry there are those who have not heard about the availability of free decryption tools.</p>
<p>Please share the message: #DontPay #NoMoreRansom</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you might have read in the previous blog posts on the brand new TestProject Python SDK (<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/getting-started-with-testproject-python-sdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part 1</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/20/creating-mobile-appium-tests-with-testproject-python-sdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part 2</a>), the SDK will generate great-looking HTML test reports and automatically publish them on the <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a> platform for you, out of the box, no additional configuration needed (you can also download them as a PDF file). <strong>But did you know that the reporting is also highly configurable?</strong> In this blog post, you’ll see all the options you have with regards to test reports and how to customize them according to your requirements in just a couple of short minutes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f40d.png" alt="🐍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/getting-started-with-testproject-python-sdk/#webinar-recording" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch this awesome webinar recording to get started with the TestProject Python OpenSDK!</a></strong> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f40d.png" alt="🐍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<li><strong><mark>You’re here →</mark></strong>HTML Test Reports for Selenium &amp; Appium Python Test Automation</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p>Test reports are crucial in any test automation framework, and we all know how hard even an expert needs to work in order to generate test automation reports, not to mention if we want to have customization freedom too… There are many tailored solutions available in the industry to help us overcome this, such as: <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/junit-xml/" rel="noopener noreferrer">JUnit</a>, Jenkins plugin, ELK, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/05/12/make-your-selenium-test-results-live-using-grafana-and-influxdb/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grafana</a>, or even developing customized web dashboards.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, none are out of the box test reporting solutions. Enter <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a>, which provides users with a complete dedicated reporting environment that supports Selenium, Appium and Python, all for free. TestProject automatically creates the HTML and PDF reports for you (out of the box, no additional configuration needed).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">All you need to do is <a target="_blank" href="https://app.testproject.io/signup/" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign up for a free TestProject account</a>, download and install the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-agents/what-is-a-testproject-agent" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject Agent</a> (that already contains all the Selenium/Appium drivers for you), install the TestProject Python SDK using pip (<code>pip install testproject-python-sdk</code>), and configure your developer token. <strong>That’s it! </strong>(For more info, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/testproject-io/python-sdk" rel="noopener noreferrer">follow this Github link</a>, or read through <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/getting-started-with-testproject-python-sdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">this great getting started tutorial</a>).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With TestProject you get free access to extensive reporting capabilities which can be fully customizable (as will be described in this article below), including: Detailed analytics dashboards in the cloud, screenshots, pass/fail criteria, custom error messages, ability to download reports to PDF, easily share reports with teammates, <a target="_blank" href="https://api.testproject.io/docs/v2/" rel="noopener noreferrer">RESTful API access</a>, and 100% Selenium and Appium compatibility (and not only with Python, but with Java and C# too!).</p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="out-of-the-box" rel="noopener noreferrer">Out of the box HTML test reports</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you leave all settings as they are, the SDK will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generate reports with the project, job and test names that are automatically inferred (see for more details <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/getting-started-with-testproject-python-sdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article</a>).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatically report a new test when the </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">quit()</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;"> command is called on a driver, or when the name of the test method that is executed changes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contain all WebDriver commands that were executed, along with their result (pass or fail).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redact values that are typed in sensitive (passwords) text field elements.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these options are configurable, as you will see soon enough.</span></p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="custom-project-job-name" rel="noopener noreferrer">Specify custom project and job names</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to override the automatically inferred project and job names that are displayed in your TestProject reports, you can do that in two ways. The first way is by passing custom project and job names as arguments to the driver constructor:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">from src.testproject.sdk.drivers import webdriver

def test_custom_project_and_job_names():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(projectname="My project", jobname="Reporting job")
    driver.get("https://example.testproject.io/web/")
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second way is by specifying them in the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">@report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decorator:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">from src.testproject.decorator import report
from src.testproject.sdk.drivers import webdriver

@report(project="My project", job="Reporting job")
def test_project_and_job_names_in_decorator():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.get("https://example.testproject.io/web/")
</pre>

<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="manual" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manual test and step reporting</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By default, the SDK automatically reports a new test when the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quit()</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> command is called on a driver, or when the name of the test method that is executed changes. This behaviour can be disabled:</span></p>

    driver.report().disable_auto_test_reports(disabled=True)
    driver.get("https://example.testproject.io/web/")
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can instead report a test manually like this:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">from src.testproject.sdk.drivers import webdriver

def test_report_a_test_manually():

    driver.report().test(name="A manually reported test", passed=True)
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will result in the following test being reported on the TestProject platform:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, you can also report intermediate steps manually, and even add screenshots when you do so:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">from src.testproject.sdk.drivers import webdriver

def test_report_a_step_manually():

    driver.report().step(description="An intermediate test step", message="An additional message", passed=False, screenshot=True)
    driver.report().test(name="A manually reported test", passed=True)
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">which will lead to this step being included in the test report:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, the step includes a screenshot (that will be enlarged when clicked). Also note that even though we set the manually reported test to passed in our code, it is marked as failed because of the failed step that is part of the test.</span></p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="redaction" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disable redaction of text typed into secured text fields</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By default, the SDK redacts text that is typed into a text field that is deemed to contain sensitive data, i.e.:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fields that have a </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">type</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;"> attribute with value </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">password</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (all browser and OS types).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fields of type </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">XCUIElementTypeSecureTextField</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (only on iOS with XCUITest).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Text typed in such a text field is replaced by asterisks in the report:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13415 size-full" title="Disable redaction of text typed into secured text fields_TestProject Reports" alt="Disable redaction of text typed into secured text fields_TestProject Reports" width="507" height="459" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image5.png"/></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you wish, this can be disabled:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">def test_disable_command_redaction():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.report().disable_auto_test_reports(disabled=True)

    driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#name").send_keys("John Smith")
    driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#password").send_keys("12345")
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">which leads to password values being reported in plain text, instead:</span></p>

<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="disabling-reporting" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disabling reporting</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, you also can disable various reporting to various degrees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t want to report WebDriver commands automatically, you can specify that as follows:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">def test_disable_driver_command_reporting():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.report().disable_command_reports(disabled=True)
    driver.get("https://example.testproject.io/web/")  # this command will not be reported
    driver.report().disable_command_reports(disabled=False)
    driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#name").send_keys("John Smith")  # this command will be reported
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to disable all reporting temporarily, you can do that, too:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">def test_disable_all_reporting_temporarily():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.report().disable_reports(disabled=True)
    # nothing will be reported here
    driver.report().disable_reports(disabled=False)
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you want to permanently disable reporting for a specific driver session, you can do that, too:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">def test_project_and_job_names_in_decorator():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(disable_reports=True)
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that in the last case, you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> re-enable reporting for the duration of the driver session!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, the TestProject Python SDK offers a variety of options to create the reporting you want very easily, solving one of the greatest challenges in open source testing. From now on, test reporting is a breeze thanks to the <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/14/announcing-testproject-new-opensdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject new OpenSDK</a>.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Employees today are more mobile than ever. As we saw, due to COVID-19 the majority of organizations moved their employees]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>Employees today are more mobile than ever. As we saw, due to COVID-19 the majority of organizations moved their employees to a work from home model overnight. This quick change of location forced businesses to implement solutions that would provide their workforces secure remote access to an increasingly complex corporate network. Notions that used to be simpler, like Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and the cloud stack further complicate secure access policy management as employees wander from the office. </p>
<p>While working from home can increase productivity, improve employee performance and reduce costs for organizations, it comes with its challenges. Slow mobile networks and latency when connecting to corporate web applications can put a burden on remote employees, resulting in decreased productivity. However, speed and connectivity aren’t the only challenges when it comes to mobile networks.</p>
<p>As cloud adoption and BYOD are on the rise, security and IT teams must face the challenge of securing the network from outside the office. If the organization is growing network security is harder to keep up with: more devices, more unique roles to account for, and unfamiliar IP addresses connecting to the network &#8211; all requiring proper security consideration. Without a deliberate approach, malicious actors can more easily compromise the organization’s network security from different points of entry.</p>
<p>To fight off potential attacks, organizations need to rethink their network security strategy by quickly adopting authentication and testing for vulnerabilities inside the network where their applications reside. </p>
<h3>Testing Environments and Networks Comes with Security Risks </h3>
<p>Automating the testing of mobile and desktop apps through the cloud saves organizations time, money, and resources but it is also crucial to make sure that this testing environment is secured. When testing applications, employees’ networks and connections must be secured in order to add another layer of protection against hackers trying to breach the testing environment. While Sauce Labs offers its Sauce Connect Proxy, a built-in HTTP proxy server that opens a secure &#8220;tunnel&#8221; connection for testing between a Sauce Labs virtual machine or real device and a website or mobile app hosted behind a corporate firewall, it is not the only security step to consider when testing remotely. </p>
<p>If an employee doesn’t have any kind of extra layer of defense when connected to his or her network, he or she is exposed to hackers trying to infiltrate their organization’s resources. One of the most common types of attacks on a network is unauthorized access. Hackers will gain entry by accessing the network by stealing employees’ weak passwords or infiltrating previously compromised users. </p>
<p>Another common risk is access control privilege escalation. This occurs when an attacker has gained access into the network and moves horizontally inside the network infrastructure and servers. This threat allows hackers to gain access to more resources and data with the original privileged access credentials they have stolen. </p>
<p>To avoid these types of attacks, organizations need to implement more concrete user restrictions with a privileged access model. This will allow them to limit who has access to their network and applications, and what they can access. By restricting access to a certain amount of users, you will decrease the number of authorized access risks to your network. With stricter network access rules in place, you will have a more secure testing environment as well. </p>
<h3>Security Solution for a More Secure Network</h3>
<p>Knowing about network risks is only half the battle. When discovering a risk to your organization, you need to clearly strategize how to address it and be proactive so it doesn’t happen again. One of the most effective ways for organizations to ensure a secure network for testing their applications is by implementing security solutions that have strong access policy controls. </p>
<p>A key benefit that comes with implementing a network security solution is the increased ability to find and fix network vulnerabilities and monitor network activity. With the help of security solutions sitting at the edge of your corporate network, you can quickly identify an attack and fix the exploitable endpoint which would otherwise have been an entry point for a successful attack. </p>
<p>Network security solutions offer a group of tools, policies, and data to help create a stronger comprehensive security strategy. The key motive when adopting security solutions is to increase the organization’s security from incoming attacks, meaning to make a successful attack an expensive and difficult prospect for any would-be hacker. </p>
<p>Alongside these security solutions, the organization will need to adopt accompanying company-wide policies that mitigate any insider risks the organization will face. Some organizations might not have the resources to implement an internal security strategy and in these cases a third party security solution will provide them with the right amount of security to fight off incoming attacks.  </p>
<h3>Moving Forward </h3>
<p>In today’s digital world, the biggest concern for organizations is data security. Attacks on organizations’ networks are happening more often and with a bigger impact, requiring companies to implement strong cybersecurity strategies in order to ensure  their network isn’t similarly vulnerable against unauthorized access. When testing your mobile and web application in a testing environment, make sure you have secure access to your corporate network. This is all it takes to test more applications without worrying about the security of your network. </p>

<div>
<p>This year&#8217;s Amazon Prime Day may be delayed (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21266249/amazon-prime-day-2020-delayed-september-coronavirus-pandemic-shipping" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reportedly until August or September</a>), but when it does arrive, it is certain to bring with it the usual flood of web traffic from hungry shoppers looking for killer deals.</p>
<p>Now one of the biggest annual shopping bonanzas on the web—for Amazon, it&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://blogs.akamai.com/2019/07/amazon-prime-day-is-now-a-major-holiday-driving-up-traffic-by-more-than-14-in-the-us.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">bigger than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined</a>—Prime Day doesn&#8217;t just bring visitors flocking to Amazon. It also delivers an onslaught of traffic to other retailers, which wisely piggyback on Amazon with their own promotional activities. Last year, <a target="_blank" href="https://chainstoreage.com/technology/prime-day-not-just-for-amazon-250-retailers-to-offer-deals" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">more than 250 retailers</a> joined in, with their average revenue <a target="_blank" href="https://chainstoreage.com/technology/other-retailers-score-big-on-prime-day-but-some-department-stores-left-in-the-cold" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">jumping a whopping 68%</a> over the two days of the sale.</p>
<p>The bad news is that massive traffic spikes such as this <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/was-amazon-prime-day-intended-performance-test-production" rel="noopener noreferrer">can wreak havoc on your network</a> if you&#8217;re unprepared. The good news is that events such as Cyber Monday and Amazon Prime Day are announced well in advance, so <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/performance-reality-check-how-keep-unexpected-surges" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can plan for them accordingly</a>.</p>
<p>With Prime Day likely a couple of months away, you have plenty of time to get your network in order so the business can plan for the surge of visitors from a place of relative comfort. Here&#8217;s how.</p>

<h3>Cache is king</h3>
<p>Stephan Roussan, president of ICVM Group, a web development and hosting agency, , said his company&#8217;s client base included high-profile corporate clients who experience high-visibility events and have a very low tolerance for downtime. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Whenever we are preparing for an exponential traffic or load event, we start with a basic assessment.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/sroussan" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stephan Roussan</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That assessment asks a series of questions that are instructive to any enterprise preparing for a traffic surge, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the baseline health of the environment, and how much ceiling is currently available in terms of available resources?</li>
<li>Can you calculate the potential peak load and anticipate when it might occur? Will there be more than one peak? How long will the peaks last?</li>
<li>If the environment is already load-balanced, how often is it rolling over to secondary and tertiary instances? Is there a chance it will exhaust all resources?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to these questions help set a base understanding for capacity planning for the surge event.</p>
<p>As another safety measure, Roussan said, his firm will look to reschedule any processes that would normally be running during the event—such as backups and index builds. This will help minimize resource consumption during the spike. Disallowing spider and bot traffic during this time is another smart idea.</p>
<p>As a final tactic, Roussan said, he can&#8217;t overemphasize the importance of a smart caching regimen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Lengthen your cache life for the anticipated spike window. You can always dial it back afterwards.&#8221;<br />—Stephan Roussan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just make sure to be in close contact with your content publishing teams so that everyone is on the same page with regard to cache-flush protocol and any lag time relating to making content updates visible publicly, he advised.</p>
<h3>Test extensively and often</h3>
<p>The counterpart to planning is testing, and plenty of it. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/spoons/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Daniel Spoonhower</a>, CTO of performance management software developer Lightstep, said that part of being ready means testing—both software systems and your staff&#8217;s readiness. </p>
<p>Spoonhower recommends starting with a standard barrage of load testing. Use synthetic but realistic application loads to understand what services will fail first and what their breaking points are. He also suggests <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34603680/what-is-squeeze-testing" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">taking advantage of squeeze testing</a>—a newer tactic popularized by Netflix to determine the threshold at which a service &#8220;breaks&#8221; by gradually applying additional traffic in incremental steps.</p>
<p>And remember that testing also means testing your staff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Game-day testing provides a safe way for your staff to practice responding to events and ensure that they have the documentation, training, and processes necessary to respond quickly and confidently.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/spoons/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Daniel Spoonhower</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a similar note, scaling your services is easier <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/3-principles-infrastructure-code-what-every-manager-should-know" rel="noopener noreferrer">if you embrace infrastructure as code</a>, said Goutham Belliappa, Capgemini&#8217;s vice president of AI engineering, so you can use simple, automated mechanisms to add capacity.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t want to leave 10 times your normal infrastructure idling and accruing charges when it’s not needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Build in auto-scaling code routines that are thoroughly tested, and don&#8217;t forget to test the throttle-down routines.&#8221; <br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/GBELLIAP" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Goutham Belliappa</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Belliappa added that you should really double down on your worst-case scenarios when performing <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/end-end-vs-contract-based-testing-how-choose" rel="noopener noreferrer">end-to-end testing</a>. If you think your surge will be 10 times your monthly peak volume, push your system to 100 times so you can understand and remediate points of fragility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t thoroughly test your infrastructure and ecosystem, you are planning to fail.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Prepare for the worst</h3>
<p>Despite all the planning and testing, even the most robust of systems are going to fail sometime. Last year, both Costco and Nordstrom experienced online <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/costco-nordstrom-rack-sites-crash-with-black-friday-sales-2019-11" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">outages during Black Friday</a>, sending thousands of potential shoppers to the competition. The solution to this is to have a strong contingency plan in place that ensures you can get back up and running quickly should a system fail.</p>
<p>When experiencing a dramatic change in input such as e-commerce platforms often see on major shopping holidays, the main risk is that a set of unforeseen errors can quickly cascade across the environment, leading to systemic failure, said <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/talws/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tal Weiss</a>, CTO of OverOps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;At that point, what began as a local surge of errors in one or more services or components can rapidly begin to generate errors in downstream or dependent services.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/talws/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tal Weiss</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The challenge in responding to a failure event such as this, Weiss said, is to determine which of the errors that you&#8217;re experiencing are new. In a scenario where literally millions of alerts could be flooding the system at once, only a handful may be relevant to finding a solution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Your team will need to have a process in place to proactively establish a baseline ahead of the surge, as well as the right set of tools to fingerprint and map errors to their code location and alert based on deviations.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Consider outsourcing the problem</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-apm-tools-can-help-predict-prepare-traffic-spikes" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planning for a traffic surge</a> is an incredibly complex endeavor, and if your organization doesn&#8217;t have the necessary skills and tools, you can quickly find yourself in over your head.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emazingbrian/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Brian Lim</a> is CEO of EmazingGroup, which sells club and festival outfits and accessories. He <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/132783196" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">appeared on <i>Shark Tank</i> in 2015</a> to pitch EmazingLights, lighted gloves designed for the rave scene. Well aware of the date and time when the show would air, Lim knew in advance when traffic would hit the company&#8217;s website almost down to the minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew that being featured on a highly viewed television show would attract quite a bit of website traffic,&#8221; said Lim. In the six months leading up to the episode&#8217;s air date, the company purchased 30 servers, simulated load tests, and invested over $500,000 to make sure the site could handle the massive influx of traffic that would be coming their way.</p>
<p>But when the episode aired, the site went down anyway, he said.</p>
<p>Lim said he considers the company&#8217;s choice of platforms, originally built on a Magento backbone, a &#8220;near fatal&#8221; error.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;A lot of money was lost that day, and it made what should have been one of the happiest days one of the worst.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emazingbrian/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Brian Lim</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To solve the problem, EmazingGroup surrendered, dropping its DIY e-commerce ambitions and moving everything to a hosted site on Shopify.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Our lives have been made immeasurably easier, and we likely would never have had this issue if we had been with Shopify from the beginning. But we didn&#8217;t let that situation sink our company. The experience was a great reminder to focus on our products and marketing above all other business functions as an e-commerce brand.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Learn from the big fish</h3>
<p>What can you learn from such mega-traffic events and the planning that goes into them? Follow their lead and adapt at an appropriate level for your online services, and you will be one step ahead. After all, customers consider performance to be a primary reflection on your brand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a previous <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/getting-started-with-testproject-python-sdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, you have seen how to get started with the brand new <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a> Python SDK and add the power of the TestProject platform to your existing Selenium-based tests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/testproject-python-sdk/0.63.13/" rel="noopener noreferrer">version 0.63.13</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Python SDK can also be used with your Appium-based tests. In this blog post, you’ll see exactly how to do that.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f40d.png" alt="🐍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Register for <a target="_blank" href="https://tricentis.zoom.us/webinar/register/6515948566289/WN_ro4hpAZ4SdaNBmUSPeje5A" rel="noopener noreferrer">this free webinar</a> I’m hosting all about the new Python SDK, Tuesday, July 28th </strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f40d.png" alt="🐍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SDK supports both mobile web and native app tests, for Android as well as for iOS. We’re going to take a look at two examples:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mobile web test on Android and Chrome, using an emulator</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A native iOS app test, using a real device</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Running mobile web tests on Android using an emulator</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m going to assume that you have already downloaded the Python SDK, have configured your Agent and developer token, and that your Agent is running. If not, you can read how to do that in this <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/getting-started-with-testproject-python-sdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>. Also, I’m going to assume that you already have created and started an emulator running Android.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take this test as an example:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="python">import pytest

from appium import webdriver
from tests.pageobjects.web import LoginPage, ProfilePage


@pytest.fixture
def driver():

    desired_capabilities = {
        "udid": "emulator-5554",
        "browserName": "chrome",
        "platformName": "Android",
    }

    driver = webdriver.Remote(desired_capabilities=desired_capabilities)
    yield driver
    driver.quit()


def test_example_on_chrome_on_android(driver):

    LoginPage(driver).open().login_as("John Smith", "12345")

    profile_page = ProfilePage(driver)
    profile_page.update_profile(
        "United States",
        "Street name and number",
        "<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c5afaaadabebb6a8acb1ad85b6aaa8a0b2ada0b7a0ebb1a9a1" rel="noopener noreferrer">[email protected]</a>",
        "+1 555 555 55",
    )
    assert profile_page.saved_message_is_displayed() is True
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see from the defined </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">desired_capabilities</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this test runs on an emulator with name </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">emulator-5554</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;">,  which runs Android. Specifying a browser name, i.e., </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">chrome</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;">, indicates that we’re running a mobile web test.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To turn this Appium test into a TestProject-powered test, similar to <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/getting-started-with-testproject-python-sdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium-based tests</a>, all you need to do is change this import statement:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">from appium import webdriver
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">from src.testproject.sdk.drivers import webdriver
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and you’re good to go. Plus: you don’t need to run your own Appium server anymore, as the TestProject Agent acts as an Appium server for you!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you run this test, it will start a Chrome browser on your Android emulator and run the test:</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><noscript><img class="alignnone wp-image-13353 size-full" title="TestProject Python SDK - Chrome browser on your Android emulator" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_1.png" alt="TestProject Python SDK - Chrome browser on your Android emulator" width="480" height="861" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_1.png 480w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image_1-285x512.png 285w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"/></noscript></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the test has finished executing, the SDK sends reports to the Agent, which will, in turn, create a new test report on the TestProject platform:</span></p>

<h2><strong>Running native app tests on iOS using a real device</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you’ve read earlier, the TestProject Python SDK supports both Android and iOS. Let’s take a look at an example test that tests a native iOS app running on a real iPhone:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">import pytest

from src.testproject.sdk.drivers import webdriver
from tests.pageobjects.android import LoginPage, ProfilePage


@pytest.fixture
def driver():

    desired_capabilities = {
        "udid": "&lt;my_device_udid_here&gt;",
        "deviceName": "iPhone van Bas",
        "browserName": "",
        "platformName": "iOS",
        "bundleId": "io.testproject.Demo",
    }

    driver = webdriver.Remote(desired_capabilities=desired_capabilities)

    yield driver

    driver.close_app()
    driver.quit()


def test_example_on_native_ios_app(driver):

    LoginPage(driver).login_as("John Smith", "12345")

    profile_page = ProfilePage(driver)

    profile_page.update_profile(
        "United States",
        "Street name and number",
        "<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9df7f2f5f3b3eef0f4e9f5ddeef2f0f8eaf5f8eff8b3e9f1f9" rel="noopener noreferrer">[email protected]</a>",
        "+1 555 555 55",
    )

    assert profile_page.saved_message_is_displayed() is True
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no browser specified in the </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">desired_capabilities</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which means that this test is running against a native app. Here’s a screenshot from the actual iOS device used, taken during test execution:</span></p>

TestProject enables you to run tests on <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/01/29/setup-ios-test-automation-windows-without-mac/" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS devices without the need for running macOS or XCode</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and without having to run an Appium server yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This test, too, passes, as we can see in the reports that are sent to TestProject:</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>After determining your project scope and requirements, use this guide to create a request for proposal (RFP) to send to the vendors on your list.</p>
<p>Here we&#8217;ve compiled a list of questions that you might want to include in your RFP. Use this list as a guide and trim away the pieces you don&#8217;t need. Try to limit your product-related questions to those that are critical to your organization and keep it short, but complete. </p>
<p>The reason: When you send lengthy lists of product requirements to vendors, you&#8217;ll get back lengthy responses that are virtually impossible to compare. Focus on your top 10 requirements, and you will find it much easier to contrast vendors and make an informed decision.</p>
<p>When evaluating the vendor responses, consider assigning weightings to the requirements to ensure that your most important requirements are ranked highest as you score the candidates.</p>
<p><em>[ How important is DX to your org? <a target="_blank" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DX00?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Take our survey</a> and find out how you stand next to the competition. Plus: <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/digital-transformation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get up to speed on digital transformation</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide. ]</em></p>
<h3>Introduce yourself—provide a statement of your current status</h3>
<h4>Statement of goals, concerns, and objectives</h4>
<ul>
<li>Describe your service management automation goals, the problems you are trying to solve, and any relevant metrics you are hoping to improve.</li>
<li>State the greatest concerns for company management relative to service management, customer satisfaction, digital transformation, and business efficiency, and explain how you expect this tool to contribute.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Describe your interoperability requirements in detail</h4>
<ul>
<li>List the tools you have, and note your preference for a tool with the specific APIs you need for things like configuration, infrastructure, and monitoring. Ask vendors to comment about interoperability in those three areas.</li>
<li>Ask how much effort it will take to integrate their product with your toolset using their APIs/openAPI.</li>
<li>Provide an inventory of the kind of data (often bi-directional) you need to support, and ask them to explain in detail what their product can do in those areas.</li>
<li>Ask how their tools interoperate with cloud-native apps.</li>
<li>Ask how their tools capture information from the cloud.</li>
<li>Ask how easy it is to switch between cloud-based and on-premises services.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Request specific details about ease of use</h4>
<p>Today&#8217;s ESM buyers are looking for products that are less complicated to implement, upgrade, license, and maintain, particularly in light of the many integrations needed to make enterprise services flow properly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask how much effort is required to implement and maintain their product.</li>
<li>Ask how much effort is needed to upgrade to a new version, including all of the integrations that have been implemented.</li>
<li>Ask them to describe their approach to licensing and license management.</li>
<li>If you are having problems with the products you already own, describe how they are falling short—how they create too much work for your team or what capabilities they lack—and explain what you expect a new solution to provide.</li>
<li>Be transparent about what you don&#8217;t have and why you think it will help you to have it. Vendors and service providers can be valuable partners, so be frank about the issues you face with your current tools. They may surprise you with fresh ideas and strategies.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Statement of resources</h4>
<ul>
<li>Explain the job titles and skillsets of the people who will use the tool.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Infrastructure requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>List the main elements of your environment that are relevant to the tool usage:</li>
<li>Operating systems</li>
<li>Hardware</li>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>DevOps frameworks/pipeline</li>
<li>Cloud strategy</li>
</ul>
<h3>Vendor information</h3>
<p>Here are sample questions to ask the vendors. Our list covers a lot of ground, but you probably won&#8217;t need to ask all of them in your RFP. If you don’t have a mainframe, for example, there’s no need to ask about that. Trim this list as required to meet your needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your company, history, and ITSM/ESM focus?</li>
<li>Who is the primary contact for sales? Who is the primary contact for technical questions?</li>
<li>Do you have reference customers that can be contacted?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Products and capabilities</h4>
<p>This section helps you understand the product, the vendor&#8217;s approach to service management, and any innovations the vendor offers.</p>
<ul>
<li>List your product or products and the primary category of each.</li>
<li>List the scope of operations the tool was designed for.</li>
<li>What kinds of skills are required to use this tool?</li>
<li>What browsers do you support?</li>
<li>What devices do you support?</li>
<li>What platforms do you support?</li>
<li>Can your product handle services that are provided by mainframe apps?</li>
<li>Which continuous integration/continuous delivery tools do you support?</li>
<li>How easy is it to integrate your product with the other tools I currently use?</li>
<li>How easy is it to extend your product?</li>
<li>What types of reporting and analytics capabilities does the product provide? Is integration with a third-party reporting tool required for minimum reporting?</li>
<li>What are the features or innovations that differentiate you from your competitors?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Deployment, updates, and support</h4>
<ul>
<li>Is your product or service offered on-premises, as a cloud service, or as a hybrid solution?</li>
<li>Does deployment require a consulting engagement?</li>
<li>Do you offer guided consulting to assist during implementation?</li>
<li>How often do you release new versions or update the software?</li>
<li>Do you offer support? What are the terms of your support contracts?</li>
<li>What training options do you offer?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>There has never been a better time to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/8-steps-get-started-enterprise-service-management" rel="noopener noreferrer">get started with ESM</a>, or to expand your ESM footprint. The vendor market has solidified, the benefits are increasingly obvious, and the tools are getting easier to use. Most importantly, some of your competitors are probably already using ESM in some areas and will continue to exploit that competitive edge over you until you enter the game.</p>
<p>Done right, ESM can become the platform for your organization’s back-office digital transformation. Back-office operations are often overlooked in the drive to achieve digital transformation. But when companies fail to address the operational side, they haven’t really transformed the business.</p>
<p>As a 2019 World Economic Forum paper said: &#8220;Customer engagement is essential, great product and services are mandatory, and an innovative economic model may be table stakes, but without operations all of that fails.&#8221; In some cases, &#8220;Back-office actually becomes front-office, as non-IT departments expose their services to their employees and customers, which in turn, requires them to become service-centric organizations,&#8221; said Pott.</p>
<p>Get started today. Using the information and guidance in this document, assemble a team with the right players, step with them through the fundamental considerations, and get a viable ESM project underway. With the right sponsor, team, and ESM technologies in place, you&#8217;ll embark on a journey of continuous improvement that will keep your organization competitive and add value to the entire business for many years to come.</p>
<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>Try to limit your product-related questions to those that are critical to your organization and keep it short. When you send lengthy lists of product requirements to vendors, you&#8217;ll get back lengthy responses that are virtually impossible to compare.</li>
<li>In the RFP, include your goals, concerns, and objectives.</li>
<li>Spell out your interoperability requirements in detail; include your current tools and an inventory of the data you need to support.</li>
<li>Get information about maintenance and support, as well as license requirements.</li>
<li>Find out about the vendor; ask about company history, primary sales/support contacts, and customer references.</li>
<li>Get details about the product&#8217;s features, functions, scope, platforms supported, and how easy or difficult it would be to extend or customize.</li>
<li>Get going! Done correctly, ESM can become the platform for your organization&#8217;s back-office digital transformation.</li>
