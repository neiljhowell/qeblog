					<description><![CDATA[The recent news that malware had been added to the Orion software sold by SolarWinds is just the latest in]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>The recent news that <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/solarwinds-hack-whos-blame-its-complicated" rel="noopener">malware had been added to the Orion software sold by SolarWinds</a> is just the latest in a series of incidents in which an adversary may have managed to compromise either hardware or software.</p>
<p>Its effect is probably much greater than the incidents that preceded it, and it probably <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/31-cybersecurity-stats-matter" rel="noopener">won’t be the last such incident</a>. This may be because we got what we asked for in the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars" rel="nofollow noopener">crypto wars of the 1990s</a>.</p>
<h3>A crypto history lesson</h3>
<p>Back in the early ’90s, the export and use of encryption that provided more than 40 bits of strength was strictly controlled by various laws throughout the world. Then, in April 1993, the Clinton White House announced a plan to allow the use and export of strong encryption, but only if the encryption had a backdoor that gave the government the ability to decrypt any encrypted data. This was implemented as the “Clipper Chip,” technology that would be used to implement the government’s plan for <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_escrow" rel="nofollow noopener">key escrow</a>.</p>
<p>In February 1994, the Department of Commerce published the Escrowed Encryption Standard (FIPS 185) to support this initiative. Attorney General Janet Reno then announced that NIST and the Department of the Treasury would be the agents for the government’s escrowed encryption program and published the procedures for releasing keys to law enforcement officials for use under approved wiretap orders. Everything seemed ready to go.</p>
<p>But a significant number of Americans were firmly against their government’s plan for escrowed encryption and believed that their need for privacy was more important than the government’s need to be able to read encrypted messages. And although there were strong opinions on both sides of this issue, the government eventually backed down and dramatically liberalized the controls on strong encryption. Other governments soon followed, and today, it’s easy to get 128-bit encryption almost anywhere.</p>
<p>Encryption that provides 128 bits of security is very, very secure. It’s the sort of thing that takes so long to crack that you’ll be able to watch the collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, which will happen a couple of billion years in the future, while you wait. Thus, if you can (correctly) use encryption that gives you 128 bits of security, absolutely nobody can crack it. And that even includes rich and powerful entities such as national governments.</p>
<h3>No problem here?</h3>
<p>But a look at the Administrative Office of the US Courts’ annual <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uscourts.gov/statistics-reports/analysis-reports/wiretap-reports" rel="nofollow noopener">Wiretap Reports</a> suggests that the use of encryption is probably not significantly interfering with the ability of law enforcement agencies to carry out wiretaps. Every year, US courts approve a couple of thousand wiretaps, and just a few of these are protected by some form of encryption that stops law enforcement officials from getting what they want.</p>
<p>And although their inability to get information from mobile devices may be a serious problem for them, it’s hard to find any data that supports the idea that the Internet is going dark for them due to the widespread use of encryption.</p>
<p>But it’s also reasonable to assume that governments did not simply decide to give up on eavesdropping when strong encryption became widely available. After all, from their point of view, law enforcement and intelligence agencies have legitimate need for surveillance. And it seems naive to assume that they would simply give up on this surveillance because their targets were using encryption. And if they are not being thwarted by the use of encryption, what’s happening?</p>
<p>If law enforcement and intelligence agencies can’t break the encryption that their targets use, we should expect them to find ways to bypass it. That’s exactly what <a target="_blank" href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/shamir_2327856.cfm" rel="nofollow noopener">Adi Shamir</a> (the “S” in “RSA”) predicted in the <a target="_blank" href="https://amturing.acm.org/vp/shamir_2327856.cfm" rel="nofollow noopener">lecture</a> that he gave after accepting the ACM’s Turing Award in 2002.</p>
<p>The third of his Three Laws of Security:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Cryptography is typically bypassed, not penetrated.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>SolarWinds is par for the course</h3>
<p>Not too many years later, we’re seeing that take place more and more frequently. The compromise of SolarWind’s<span style="color:rgb(117, 120, 123)"> Orion software is just the most recent of these.</span></p>
<p>An easy way to do that is to subvert the hardware and software that implements the encryption. This could be implemented as subtle modifications to cryptographic algorithms, as may have happened to the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG" rel="nofollow noopener">Dual EC DRBG</a> random bit generator that is speculated to have been compromised by the US government. Or it could be implemented as malware that intercepts plaintext values at the TCP/IP application layer, when they are no longer protected by encryption that takes place at the transport layer or below. Or it could be implemented as hardware that gives government agents access to information that a computer might be processing. Or it could be implemented as something just like the malware that infected SolarWind’s Orion software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the absence of the ability to beat strong encryption, using techniques such as SolarWind’s Orion to bypass it seems like a natural step for governments to take.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, it may be the case that relying on subverted hardware and software is the price that we need to pay for having strong encryption. Let’s just hope that we don’t end up having to deal with multiple, incompatible compromises at the same time when different governments don’t coordinate their efforts.</p>
<h3>Back the backdoors</h3>
<p>To make sure that this can’t happen, it’s not hard to imagine an ISO/IEC standard for coordinating these backdoors being worked on by representatives of lots of national governments, all of which really work for their governments’ intelligence agencies, yet won’t openly admit to the other people on their committee that they also do.</p>
<p>It could end up being much like G.K. Chesterton’s story “A Man Called Thursday,” in which everyone on the committee of anarchists ends up being a government agent keeping tabs on the actions of anarchists. (It’s also not hard to imagine a situation in which the bumbling grandson of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_Clouseau" rel="nofollow noopener">Jacques Clouseau</a> ends up working on this standard, along with like-minded people from other countries, of course.)</p>
<h3>Learn to live with it</h3>
<p>So is the SolarWinds compromise serious? Absolutely. Does its seriousness justify the time and effort being spent on double-checking the security and integrity of our software development and delivery processes? Again, yes. But will any effort to make sure that a similar compromise doesn’t happen again stop such compromises in the future?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, probably not. There are simply too many rich and powerful governments with an interest in making sure that similar compromises will happen again in the future. And this is probably an unintended consequence of the outcome of the crypto wars of the ’90s, but it’s probably one that we’re going to have to live with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>As we gratefully move forward into the year 2021, we have to recognise that 2020 was as tumultuous in the digital realm as it has in the physical world. From low level fraudsters leveraging the pandemic as a vehicle to trick victims into parting with money for non-existent PPE, to more capable actors using malware that has considerably less prevalence in targeted campaigns. All of which has been played out at a time of immense personal and professional difficulties for millions of us across the world.</p>
<h2>Dealing with the noise</h2>
<p>What started as a trickle of phishing campaigns and the occasional malicious app quickly turned to thousands of malicious URLs and more-than-capable threat actors leveraging our thirst for more information as an entry mechanism into systems across the world. There is no question that COVID was the dominant theme of threats for the year, and whilst the natural inclination will be to focus entirely on such threats it is important to recognise that there were also very capable actors operating during this time.</p>
<p>For the first time we made available <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/lp/covid-19-dashboard.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">a COVID-19 dashboard</a> to complement our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-quarterly-threats-july-2020.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">threat report</a> to track the number of malicious files leveraging COVID as a potential lure.  What this allows is real time information on the prevalence of such campaigns, but also clarity about the most targeted sectors and geographies.  Looking at the statistics from the year clearly demonstrates that the overarching theme is that the volume of malicious content increased.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-115996" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-2.png" alt="" width="941" height="491" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-2.png 941w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-2-300x157.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-2-768x401.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-2-205x107.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px"/></p>
<p>Whilst of course this a major concern, we must recognise that there were also more capable threat actors operating during this time.</p>
<h2>Ransomware – A boom time</h2>
<p>The latter part of 2020 saw headlines about increasing ransom demands and continued successes from ransomware groups. An indication as to the reason why was provided in early 2020 in a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/cybercriminals-actively-exploiting-rdp-to-target-remote-organizations/" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a> published by Thomas Roccia that revealed “The number of RDP ports exposed to the Internet has grown quickly, from roughly three million in January 2020 to more than four and a half million in March.”</p>
<p>With RDP a common entry vector used predominantly by post intrusion ransomware gangs, there appears some explanation as to the reason why we are seeing more victims in the latter part of 2020.   Indeed, in the same analysis from Thomas we find that the most common passwords deployed for RDP are hardly what we would regard as strong.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-115999" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-1.png" alt="" width="922" height="622" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-1.png 922w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-1-300x202.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-1-768x518.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-1-191x129.png 191w" sizes="(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px"/></p>
<p>If we consider the broader landscape of RDP being more prevalent (we have to assume due to the immediate need for remote access due to the lockdowns across the globe), the use of weak credentials, then the success of ransomware groups become very evident.  Indeed, later in the year we detailed our research into the Netwalker <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/take-a-netwalk-on-the-wild-side/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ransomware</a> group that reveals the innovation, affiliate recruitment and ultimately financial success they were able to gain during the second quarter of 2020.</p>
<h2>A year of major vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The year also provided us with the added gifts of major vulnerabilities. In August, for example, there was a series of zero-day vulnerabilities in a widely used, low-level TCP/IP software library developed by Treck, Inc.  Known as Ripple 20, the affect to hundreds of millions of devices resulted in considerable concern related to the wider supply chain of devices that we depend upon. In collaboration with JSOF, the McAfee ATR team <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ripple20-critical-vulnerabilities-detection-logic-and-signatures/" rel="noopener noreferrer">developed</a> a Detection Logic and Signatures for organizations to detect these vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Of course the big vulnerabilities did not end there; we had the pleasure of meeting <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/cve-2020-16898-bad-neighbor/" rel="noopener noreferrer">BadNeighbour</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/on-drovorub-linux-kernel-security-best-practices/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drovorub</a>, and so many more. The almost seemingly endless stream of vulnerabilities with particularly high CVSS Scores has meant that the need to patch very high on the list of priorities.</p>
<h2>The ‘sophisticated’ attacker</h2>
<p>As we closed out 2020, we were presented with details of ‘nation states’ carrying out sophisticated attacks.   Whilst under normal circumstances such terminology is something that should be avoided, there is no question that the level of capability we witness from certain threat campaigns are a world away from the noisy COVID phishing scams.</p>
<p>In August of 2020, we released the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/lp/insights-preview.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">MVISION Insights</a> dashboard which provides a free top list of campaigns each week. This includes, most recently, tracking against the SUNBURST trojan detailed in the SolarWinds attack, or the tools stolen in the FireEye breach.   What this demonstrates is that whilst prevalence is a key talking point, there exists capable threat actors targeting organizations with real precision.</p>
<p>For example, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/operation-north-star-behind-the-scenes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operation North Star</a> campaign in which the threat actors deployed an Allow and Block list of targets in order to limit those they would infect with a secondary implant.</p>
<p>The term sophisticated is overused, and attribution is often too quickly relegated to the category of nation state.  However, the revelations have demonstrated that there are those campaigns where the attack did use capabilities not altogether common and we are no doubt witnessing a level of innovation from threat groups that is making the challenge of defence harder.</p>
<p>What is clear is that 2020 was a challenging year, but as we try and conclude what 2021 has in store, we have to celebrate the good news stories.   From initiatives such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nomoreransom.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">No More Ransom</a> continuing to tackle ransomware, to the unprecedented accessibility of tools that we can all use to protect ourselves (e.g. please check ATR GitHub repo, but recognise there are more).</p>

<h2 id="h.dojfz56llg4x">A bit of background on the Hackathon</h2>
<p>The software engineering community was tasked with testing the functional and visual quality of the “Applifashion” retail app to ensure it was ready for the busy online holiday shopping season. The hackathon, which took roughly two hours to complete, challenged participants to author tests and catch bugs using the <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/next-generation-cross-browser-testing/" rel="noopener">Applitools Ultrafast Test Cloud platform</a>. Participants also practiced modern QA techniques, used advanced features such as <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/root-cause-analysis/" rel="noopener">root cause analysis</a>, and learned how <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/visual-testing/" rel="noopener">Visual AI technology compares to pixel-based image comparison</a>. Winners were randomly selected from the pool of participants who successfully completed the submission criteria.</p>
<h2 id="h.oj7xe73datht">What the Hackathon winners say</h2>
<p>We wanted to leave you with quotes from the Hackathon winners. We are thrilled to recognize them for their achievements and are pleased with their success.</p>
<h3>About the Hackathon</h3>
<ul>
<li>“The Holiday Shopping Hackathon allowed me to gain working knowledge and insight about all the great tools and features that Applitools has to offer. I now interested in looking into using Applitools in my current role.” – Taylor Ellsworth, Automation Engineer</li>
<li>“<a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/cypress-cross-browser-testing/" rel="noopener">Using Cypress + Applitools</a>, setting up tests to run across different browsers, devices, and viewport sizes took less than an hour. With traditional automation tools, this could take days! Even without concurrent runs, I executed 15 tests in multiple browser combos in less than 60 seconds. Applitools and Cypress’ dashboards provide helpful insights into failed tests and track execution history all without any extra setup or reporting integration. Ultra fast!” – Lauren Christianson, Automation Engineer</li>
<li>“I am a fan of Batman and I like this quote from the movie Batman Begins – “It’s not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.” This is very apt for Applitools and no matter how many competitors arise, they are going to excel always.” – Sainath Ramanathan, Principal Software Engineer</li>
<li>“Hackathon is a unique way to learn <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/visual-testing/" rel="noopener">visual testing</a> using such an innovative product. The tool shows the power of <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/applitools-ai-and-deep-learning/" rel="noopener">complex AI-based algorithms</a> in easy and intuitive features. This is the 3rd time I am participating in the Applitools hackathon and still learning new things (features) about the product. Thank you <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> team for organizing such wonderful events.” – Sakshi Nagpai, Tester</li>
<li>“Applitools Holiday Shopping Hackathon was fun, interesting &amp; a great opportunity to learn in depth about the Applitools platform. <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/next-generation-cross-browser-testing/" rel="noopener">Ultrafast grid</a> is named just right as it checks the visual diffs across a range of devices &amp; viewports within seconds.” – Tarun Narula, Test Manager</li>
<li>“Great accessible introduction to an awesome testing platform! As a Cypress and Applitools newbie, the platform was extremely easy to use and I was able to hit the ground visual ai testing super quickly!” – Willian Andrews, Developer</li>
</ul>
<h3>About Visual AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>“Applitools hackathon was a great way of showcasing, yet again, how difficult is to create a robust and maintainable pack of automated scenarios to have a good coverage of our web applications and how important visual testing is in order to provide the best user experience. With the massive matrix of devices/browsers/versions/OS available currently, it brings even more complexity that needs to be handled, unfortunately involving a lot of time and technical expertise. After solving the traditional approach and starting into the modern one with <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/visual-testing/" rel="noopener">Visual AI</a> and Ultrafast Grid solution, it made me realise how easy it was to setup the same scenarios to run across different browsers, devices, and operating systems into such a configurable tool as Applitools. Ultrafast Grid takes away the pain of having all these available, or integrating with another 3rd party cloud solution. It gives a really powerful solution to have such a broad coverage of visual tests running in different configurations, less code and less maintenance as you don’t need to handle all the required steps or selectors anymore. One screenshot and off you go!” – Ioana Porcarasu, Head of Quality</li>
<li>“I am so happy to have found this hackathon. It changed my view of Visual AI testing from being good-to-have to a must-have in every project. Applitools Eyes is easy to use and adds a huge value to your test project.” – Bushra Alam, Automation Engineer</li>
<li>“An extraordinary occasion to profound plunge into Applitools and to investigate Visual AI testing. Hackathon is one method of becoming more acquainted with additional about how to utilize Applitools with the references given in the notes is truly marvelous strategy. Applitools – A Game Changer for Visual Testing.” – Madan Mohan Reddy Badveli, Automation Engineer</li>
<li>“I have learned a lot in Ultrafast Grid and the power of Visual AI testing through this hackathon. This is the tool that I have been looking for in visual testing.” Yudi Edisugiarto</li>
<li>“After completing the challenge, I am eager to learn more about visual AI assisted testing tools.” Aabishkar KC, Automation Engineer</li>
