<p>There has never been a better time to get started with enterprise service management (ESM). The vendor landscape has solidified, and TechBeacon&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/buyers-guide-esm-products?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buyer’s Guide to Enterprise Service Management Products</a> reveals a market that&#8217;s competing vigorously for your business.</p>
<p>Charles Betz, who wrote <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/forrester-wave-esm-q419?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Forrester Wave for Enterprise Service Management</a>, said the products interoperate nicely and are easier to use than those of earlier generations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Any of these tools is a credible alternative—even the ones that come in last in the &#8216;Wave.&#8217; There are around 400 tools to choose from—it&#8217;s crazy—and they all offer value of some kind.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/CharlesTBetz" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Charles Betz</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Couple that abundance of choice with enhancements that add AI, automation, machine learning, and predictive capabilities, and you have a new ESM game where businesses can save money while supporting their customers and employees with new levels of responsiveness and efficiency.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/it-service-management-tb/automation-ai-and-analytics-reinventing-itsm?lx=-rqtPA" rel="noopener noreferrer">A 2019 EMA study</a><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/it-service-management-tb/automation-ai-and-analytics-reinventing-itsm?lx=-rqtPA&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer"> </a>found that 87% of the organizations surveyed already had some level of ESM underway. So, many of your competitors are likely already reaping some of the benefits of ESM: increased customer satisfaction, scalable efficiency, and enhanced productivity. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been waiting for the right time to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/5-ways-overcome-practical-political-challenges-esm" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduce ESM to your organization</a>, there&#8217;s no longer any reason to stall. As they say, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is today.</p>
<p>Having a lot of tools to choose from can be overwhelming, but don&#8217;t worry about that quite yet. You don&#8217;t start by looking for the right tools; you start by looking for the right project. First you need to be sure you know exactly what you need to accomplish, and why that&#8217;s worth doing.</p>
<p>Many organizations have experience with <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/it-service-management-tb/itsm-tools-practices?lx=-rqtPA&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">IT service management (ITSM)</a>, but that&#8217;s not quite the same thing. </p>
<p>A key difference between ESM and ITSM is scope. ITSM refers to services delivered by IT—things such as provisioning laptops, managing cloud services, and patching and upgrading servers. ESM is a much larger idea, covering all kinds of non-IT services your enterprise delivers to customers and employees, such as hiring, catering, business travel, and sales call requests.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/extend-it-service-management?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESM is a long-term strategy</a> for an organization and can add significant value to the business across many dimensions, over many years. But it will die after the first try in your organization if the first project is overly complex, takes too long, or delivers a mediocre result in an area that nobody really cares about.</p>
<p>Here are eight ways to set yourself up for success with a smart ESM project that will prove the value of service management and lay the foundation for your ESM road map—and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-pandemic?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">your digital transformation</a>—for years to come.</p>

<h3>1. Choose a progressive department</h3>
<p>The IT department is used to service management automation, but other departments might find it harder to embrace it. You&#8217;ll be miles ahead if you can run your project in an area of the organization that welcomes experimentation.</p>
<p>Look for a department that is known for being progressive, with managers who are not afraid of the uncertainties that come with trying new technologies and practices.</p>
<p>Avoid spinning up your initial project in a department where teams are afraid to make mistakes. They will be slower to learn and will not have the proper support and confidence to move ESM forward, said Doug Tedder, principal of Tedder Consulting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Successful companies understand that progress often requires you to fail fast and learn fast. [Their attitude is], if we don’t succeed at first, what did we learn? Let’s make changes and try again.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/dougtedder" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Doug Tedder</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is practical value in letting one area of the business step up to be the pioneers for ESM projects. Their experience will pave the way for projects across the whole organization.</p>
<p>In a couple of years, that group will be prepared to tackle more difficult ESM challenges, such as how to make sure you handle privacy data properly, he said. Without that well-supported learning model, the organization as a whole may take much longer to reach the level of ESM maturity that will let it take advantage of emerging technologies and competitive opportunities.</p>
<h3>2. Look at different request-fulfillment workflows</h3>
<p>Straightforward service requests of every kind are &#8220;low-hanging-fruit targets for starting ESM,&#8221; Tedder said. Human resources is a natural place to expand these principles beyond IT, because HR is usually &#8220;fairly well-defined regarding function and responsibilities and handles many requests from both within and external to the organization,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Phyllis Drucker, a senior consultant at Linium, said HR tended to be forward-thinking about automation, considering chatbots, for example, for their portals &#8220;even out of the gate.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;[HR organizations are] far more focused on the employee experience than many IT groups, who are more focused on the technical aspects of support.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/msitsm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Phyllis Drucker</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A fairly typical HR implementation will include setting up a portal to handle some of the more frequent HR requests. This involves importing existing knowledge into the tool&#8217;s knowledge base, and then instrumenting a common chatbot script that looks for answers or submits simple requests, according to Drucker.</p>
<p>Other corporate areas to consider are facilities, internal catering services, or really any internal support organization that receives and processes requests from another area of an organization, Tedder said.</p>
<p>When you find situations where end users, employees, or customers are currently using email or phone calls to request information or services, &#8220;they are falling-off-the-tree ripe for ESM,&#8221; according to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/enterprise-service-m?lx=XrrwBl" rel="noopener noreferrer">a 2019 EMA report</a> titled &#8220;Enterprise Service Management: It&#8217;s Closer Than You Think.&#8221; It&#8217;s based on in-depth research with 400 global IT executives.</p>
<p>Even if you use ESM only to log and track a request, close the ticket when the work is done, and deliver regular reports, you will have delivered a winning ESM project with measurable value. You&#8217;ll be replacing manual workflows where requests can get lost, forgotten, or misdirected with order, accountability, speed, and increased customer satisfaction.</p>
<p><em>[ Robotic Process Automation can do mundane tasks, allowing you to get strategic. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/8743/396776?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Find out how in this April 28 Webinar.</a></em> <em>Plus</em><em>: Learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/robotic-process-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to roll out RPA</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide. ]</em></p>
<h3><span>3. Choose projects with limited risks</span></h3>
<p>Make sure you start with smaller, internal processes before you jump into a workflow that customers see, Tedder said. Internal processes let you learn by doing, see results, and make adjustments, he said.</p>
<p>Customer-facing processes are less forgiving and can even damage your brand if something clumsy happens.</p>
<p>And remember that it’s very risky to work with regulated data and systems during your initial projects. Sales and financial departments are not the best places to experiment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Eventually they will benefit from what you learn on the other things.&#8221;<br />—Doug Tedder</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Always bear in mind that <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-extend-it-service-management-whole-business" rel="noopener noreferrer">your entire organization will be learning to trust service management</a>, and each successful project will build experience and credibility across the business. Limiting the exposure to risk, especially early on, will make everyone more comfortable.</p>
<h3>4. Get to launch quickly</h3>
<p>Limit the scope so you don&#8217;t run out of oxygen before you can launch. Don&#8217;t choose initial projects that will take six months or a year to complete, said Tedder. Think in terms of small, quick iterations of work.</p>
<p>Look at things that you can spin up in a month or two, and that will begin delivering measurable improvements within a quarter or two.</p>
<p>If your sponsor wants to tackle something big, break it up into phases, and make sure the first phase is meaningful and can be finished quickly.</p>
<h3>5. Use existing tools when you can</h3>
<p>People sometimes discover products already in use somewhere in the organization that could be used for ESM. Of course, not all tools can be leveraged for this purpose.</p>
<p>For example, it is very likely that someone is using some kind of ticket-tracking tool somewhere in your organization, but it might not turn out to be an ESM tool, said Tedder. You may even discover that some of those using a ticket-tracking tool are trying to use it to manage their ESM demands and are struggling, he said.</p>
<p>This kind of tool would not be a good fit for your ESM project.</p>
<p>As you look for tool capabilities that would support ESM, Tedder suggested you look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workflow definition and automation</li>
<li>Queue management</li>
<li>Performance reporting</li>
<li>Service request catalog support</li>
<li>Service portfolio support</li>
<li>Escalation/alerting</li>
<li>Ability to pre-define models (for managing requests, incidents, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-choose-it-service-management-tool" rel="noopener noreferrer">find existing ITSM tools</a> that you want to use for ESM, Tedder suggested you be very smart about how you use them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In my experience, many organizations are too concerned with the implementation of the tool and do not put any effort into the design of processes, measurement, and continual improvement—things that are critical for ESM success.&#8221;<br />—Doug Tedder</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Existing tools may not be free, so you may need to buy additional licenses when you expand the use of an existing tool. But if you can find a way to repurpose something already being used, you will benefit from having people in-house who already know how to use it, and you might be able to shave some days off of your timeline.</p>
<h3>6. Do something that will have a measurable impact</h3>
<p>ESM is supposed to make back-office operations better, faster, and cheaper across the organization, so select a project with the metrics to prove it. Choose something that can deliver business benefits, including reduced costs or improved speed and efficiency by implementing workflow automation, user self-service, or workload reductions.</p>
<p>This is likely to be where most of the financial savings will be identified that will clearly demonstrate the ROI, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/digital-transformation-esm?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent ESM white paper</a>, &#8220;Digital Transformation &amp; ESM.&#8221;</p>
<p>Be sure to capture all the relevant &#8220;before&#8221; metrics to show what the baseline was when using overly manual processes, delivering siloed responses to requests, and relying on shared email boxes to capture service requests.</p>
<p>Relevant metrics will demonstrate how ESM has made something better, faster, and/or cheaper. Track things such as average response time for incoming requests, employee satisfaction ratings, average completion time for service requests, average daily requests handled per staff member, service volumes, and even customer feedback and satisfaction scores.</p>
<p>Remember, ESM must earn the trust of the business. Data is the language you use for that.</p>
<h3>7. Leverage existing knowledge bases</h3>
<p>Having a good base of current, well-documented knowledge can set you up nicely for a chatbot implementation. With a good existing knowledge base, little else is needed to get started, said Linium&#8217;s Drucker.</p>
<p>You need a service portal with an embedded chatbot and a couple of simple scripts that allow the bot to pull information from the existing knowledge base, or submit the right request for someone, she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen organizations start at this level with a simple but robust script that searches for answers or submits a ticket,&#8221; said Drucker.</p>
<p>If you have been doing ESM for a long time and have already developed good knowledge bases, the predictive tools that some ESM apps offer are the easiest place to start adding automation, Drucker said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In some cases, you can just turn these tools on and they will almost instantly start offering up information. The effort goes into setting up the processes to deal with that information.&#8221;<br />—Phyllis Drucker</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Be prepared for what it takes</h4>
<p>Don&#8217;t underestimate the level of effort this might require. You&#8217;ll need to define exactly what should happen in every possible scenario, so your processes play by the rules of governance.</p>
<p>These examples from Drucker highlight the level of analysis that this requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a tool displays five similar incidents and five possible fixes, does the service desk agent know how to proceed? Have results been tested enough to know how exact a match is needed to avoid doing more harm versus restoring service with a workaround?</li>
<li>If the tool says a particular change has a 75% chance of success as documented, does the organization understand the process and risk well enough to drive the right level of authorization for the change, based on that prediction?</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. Take a building-block approach</h3>
<p>It’s a good idea to think about your ESM initiatives in terms of building blocks, Tedder said. Here are some tips.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the first business problem</strong> you want to solve; maybe you can do something small in that space first. It should take weeks, not years, to solve it to some degree of completeness. Get that block in place.</li>
<li><strong>Be responsive to the needs of the business.</strong> Design an adaptive, flexible road map that can adjust to emerging opportunities. You want to make sure that you are working on things that really matter to the entire organization, not just the requirements of one or two departments.</li>
<li><strong>Add block after block of new ESM projects</strong> or extended AI capabilities in a regular cadence.</li>
<li><strong>Show incremental value,</strong> using meaningful metrics mapped to business objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Continue to roll in that way, </strong>and in two years you will have everything in place that you dreamed of, and your organization will be prepared to adopt advanced technologies as they come to market.</li>
</ul>
<p>You&#8217;ll also have a lot more satisfied customers and employees by then. And you&#8217;ll probably have a bigger ESM budget and staff as well.</p>
<ol/>
<h3>Get started</h3>
<p>Once you have defined a project that you can pilot in a safe place, that won&#8217;t take too long to complete, and that will be meaningful to your business, you&#8217;re ready to think about tools. If you didn&#8217;t discover some tools already in place that are right for your project, you will need to add ESM to your toolkit.</p>
<p>Get this first project right, and you will earn the trust of the business, build expertise in your team, and establish a foundation that can support the digital transformation of your business for years to come.</p>

<p>The widespread use of Kubernetes is testament to enterprises&#8217; faith in their ability not just to handle the complexity of modern app development and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/sap-modernization-enterprise-devops-tb/modernize-legacy-apps?lx=AL8Ybs&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">modernization initiatives</a>, but to do so at scale.</p>

<p>But while Kubernetes is one of the most popular projects on GitHub, many organizations are still <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/47-advanced-tutorials-mastering-kubernetes" rel="noopener noreferrer">intimidated by its complexity</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Organizations have seen <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb/move-app-to-continuous-delivery?lx=-DC2cJ&amp;custom_url=continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">the value of building </a><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb/move-app-to-continuous-delivery?lx=-DC2cJ&amp;custom_url=continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">microservices</a>—delivering applications as discrete functional parts, each of which can be delivered as a container and managed separately. But for every application there are more parts to manage, especially at scale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kubernetes solves that problem by providing an extensible, declarative platform that <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/capistrano-kubernetes-lessons-phraseapps-transition" rel="noopener noreferrer">automates the management of containers</a> for high availability, resiliency, and scale. But Kubernetes is a big, complex, fast-moving, and sometimes confusing platform that requires users to develop new skills. The Kubernetes project itself recently completed a security audit. (Here&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/kubernetes-security-audits-what-admins-need-know-do" rel="noopener noreferrer">what admins need to know</a> about it.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Companies developing their <a target="_blank" href="http://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/kubernetes-heralds-cloud-native-era" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud-native strategies</a>, including <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/ai-ops-transform-it-tb/ai-cloud-ops-efficiency?lx=my3YKV&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">what platforms and tools they should use</a> to ensure the safe deployment of cloud-native apps, may benefit from understanding Kubernetes&#8217; security challenges, which fall into four main buckets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are the challenges you&#8217;ll face, and recommendations for mitigating them.</p>
<p><em>[ Get up to speed on <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/it-operations-monitoring-tb?utm_campaign=00134846&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_source=techbeacon" rel="noopener noreferrer">IT Operations Monitoring with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide</a>.

<h3>1. Hardening and compliance</h3>
<p dir="ltr">When using Kubernetes, you must be hyperfocused on what is and is not turned on by default. For example, pod security policies are key to securing a multi-tenant cluster, but the feature is still beta and is not turned on by default. The feature-rich Kubernetes platform can make it <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-configure-harden-your-managed-kubernetes-services" rel="noopener noreferrer">challenging to understand the default features</a>, but it is essential to figure it out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Organizations can <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/4-lessons-soc-metrics-what-your-secops-team-needs-know" rel="noopener noreferrer">use security benchmarks</a> to help harden Kubernetes. The Center for Internet Security, for example, provides configuration guidelines to harden systems, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">including Kubernetes</a>, against evolving cyber threats.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Having this type of step-by-step checklist can go a long way toward securing a system as complex as Kubernetes. However, since security is always about risk management, organizations need to evaluate <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/3-best-practices-container-performance-testing" rel="noopener noreferrer">the impact of certain settings on performance</a> and weigh the risks versus the benefits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some organizations don&#8217;t have the skillsets or time <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/6-best-practices-highly-available-kubernetes-clusters" rel="noopener noreferrer">to harden Kubernetes</a> on their own. It can be a huge job to ensure that the desired configuration of the cluster is set and maintained to include things such as ensuring access to the API server is always over HTTPS, that X.509 certificates are used to authenticate communication between platform components, or that the etcd datastore is encrypted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Organizations that are overwhelmed by even this relatively short list might want to consider a commercial implementation of Kubernetes that has already done the hardening.</p>
<h3>2. Managing configurations of all workloads deployed on the cluster</h3>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to managing the configuration of the cluster, organizations need to manage the configurations of all the workloads running on the cluster. You can use the <a target="_blank" href="https://helm.sh" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">open-source tool Helm Charts</a> to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-manage-containers-scale-3-challenges" rel="noopener noreferrer">automate application provisioning and configuration</a> for Kubernetes as well as to deploy simple or complex applications made up of several separate services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, while Helm is very useful for managing Day 1 operations, it does not extend to Day 2 operations, which is where Kubernetes operators shine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Operators are a way to package, deploy, and manage complex applications designed to run on Kubernetes. Operators take human operational knowledge and encode it into software that is packaged with the application and shared.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They make it easier for application developers to deliver automated lifecycle management for the services that run on Kubernetes. Helm Charts can also be wrapped in a Kubernetes operator and used together.</p>
<p>When it comes to security, operators ensure that services deployed on Kubernetes maintain supported configurations; if an unsupported configuration is made to a deployed service, operators can reset the service to its original, declared configuration.</p>
<p>The really interesting thing is that you can use Kubernetes operators to manage Kubernetes itself, making it easier to deliver and automate secured deployments.</p>
<p><em>[ Robotic Process Automation can do mundane tasks, allowing you to get strategic. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/8743/396776?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Find out how in this April 28 Webinar.</a></em> <em>Plus</em><em>: Learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/robotic-process-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to roll out RPA</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide. ]</em></p>
<h3>3. Managing multi-tenant clusters</h3>
<p>As Kubernetes scales, it becomes more and more difficult to manage all workloads deployed on the clusters and the clusters themselves. Multi-tenancy is one of the most effective ways to handle what could easily become chaotic. Indeed, Kubernetes&#8217; support for multi-tenancy has come a long way.</p>
<p>Key capabilities include the following, (which, you should note, are not always turned on by default):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Namespaces,</strong> which allow organizations to isolate multiple teams within the same physical cluster when used with RBAC (defined below) and network policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Role-based access control (RBAC) </strong>determines whether a user is allowed to perform a given action within a cluster or namespace. To help simplify the use of RBAC, consider the use of default roles that can be bound to users and groups cluster-wide or locally per namespace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Resource quotas in Kubernetes </strong>limit aggregate resource consumption per namespace, making systems less vulnerable to attacks such as denial of service. By default, all resources in a Kubernetes cluster are created with unbounded CPU and memory requests/limits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Network policy for micro-segmentation</strong> specifies how groups of pods communicate with each other and other network endpoints. Policies are namespace-scoped. By default, if no policies are set in a namespace, ingress and egress traffic is allowed to and from pods in that namespace.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Balancing security and agility</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The pressure is on for organizations to constantly innovate, which makes it easy to treat security as an afterthought. Ideally, security is built into the DevOps cycle, but organizations will benefit by explicitly adding &#8220;sec&#8221; into the middle of DevOps—or, put another way, by <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/6-devsecops-best-practices-automate-early-often" rel="noopener noreferrer">building as much security automation</a> into the pipeline as possible.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To ensure that app dev organizations can implement security best practices, take a step back and revisit your CI/CD pipelines. Are they using automated unit and functional tests? Have they integrated automated security gates such as integrated vulnerability scanners?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ops can help with DevSecOps by adding features to both development and production clusters that make it easy for the app dev team to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-microservices-broke-monitoring-how-fix-it" rel="noopener noreferrer">leverage monitoring, alerting, and logging services</a> in a uniform way while developing and deploying microservice-based apps.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition, while adding a service mesh to a Kubernetes cluster may seem to add complexity, it&#8217;s actually making important business logic more visible. Previously, developers needed to build the logic into their code. Now, these capabilities can be made available as part of the Kubernetes platform, saving developers work and accelerating the delivery of microservices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A service mesh also provides more visibility for microservice interactions to the operations team, especially when observability and visualization of east-west cluster traffic are included as part of the service mesh solution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But this is not just about tools; it&#8217;s also about culture and process. Ideally, this kind of self-assessment work, along with changes to the CI/CD pipeline, is done in collaboration with the organization&#8217;s security team, creating an opportunity for <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-bridge-security-development-divide" rel="noopener noreferrer">developers to learn more about security and vice versa</a>. After all, there&#8217;s a shortage of security professionals, so let&#8217;s work together and spread the wealth.</p>
<h3>Use the tools and techniques at your disposal</h3>
<p>Build security capabilities into your software that make it as easy as possible for your organization to meet its security goals without having to rely on a large collection of point products that may or may not work well together.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s terrific to see the Kubernetes community invest not only in traditional security evaluations, such as the Kubernetes security audit, but also in the full spectrum of capabilities that enhance security, including hardening guidance, RBAC, pod security policies, network policies, service mesh, and operators.</p>

<h3>Parasoft Selenic and Applitools Eyes Integrate to Improve Web UI Testing</h3>
<p>Guest Author: Joyce (Joy) Ruff, Product Marketing Manager at Parasoft.</p>
<p>In a web application design, the user interface (UI) can make or break the usability. To verify the UI works well, you need to ensure that you can thoroughly test it. As applications become more complex and more difficult to test, an automated test environment provides better visibility to potential web UI issues. </p>
<p>For many companies, Selenium is the de facto standard for web UI testing. Parasoft introduced the Selenic tool to enhance Selenium test creation with the page object model, simplify maintenance with self-healing, and reduce testing time with optimized execution. With Parasoft Selenic, you can understand if your Selenium tests have broken due to locators or wait conditions and receive AI-powered recommendations for how to fix them.</p>
<p>With the latest release, Selenic now provides integration with Applitools, which uses AI to capture screenshots of UI differences that can be hard to see without the aid of computer vision. The combination of these capabilities makes it easier for you to assess the results of your Web UI testing. With a simple configuration setup, when you run your Selenium tests with Selenic, an Applitools Visual AI screenshot will be automatically captured at each click and navigation step, ensuring maximum test coverage with incredible speed, accuracy, and stability.</p>
<p>See how fast and easy it is to integrate Applitools and Selenic for better visibility of your web UI changes in this short video.</p>

</div>
<p>We all are living in a Digital Era where the smartphones and web applications dominate everything we do in day-to-day activities some way or the other. The time we spend daily interacting with our phones or laptops is huge these days.</p>
<p>We need to understand the fact that not all people would be able to use today’s mobile or web applications in the same way. There are people with various disabilities which makes the usage of some applications not accessible to them.</p>
<p>An application should always be built keeping in mind about all types of end-users. Considering the statistics released by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/disability" rel="noopener noreferrer">WorldBank</a> – </p>
<p><strong><em>“One billion people or 15% of the world population undergo some sort of disability.”</em></strong></p>
<p>So, as an organisation, it is our foremost duty to consider accessibility testing a priority before we release any applications to our end users.</p>
<p>In this article, we will see a few types of common disabilities, how to perform accessibility testing and some of the commonly used tools in the market to perform various types of accessibility testing.</p>
<h2><strong>Types of disabilities</strong></h2>
<p>There are multiple types of disabilities people will face at some point in time in their life. Here are some common disabilities:</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/TyixQITmkVerxSQFv0RXl7IlFutuDlNIR0a-NZQQbEeGfzaEFgM-lWq22t-55gG68m38g3X3OWyeGTqgDPfUhMBdJmmwLBPAvY6GXkfifK6QnZrt-dnaSvPFQy5nZYGrAcH0uwwm" alt="" width="447" height="447"/></figure>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Physical Disability </li>
<li>Cognitive Disability </li>
<li>Eyesight / Vision Disability </li>
<li>Hearing Disability</li>
<li>Temporary Disability</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>Physical Disability</em></strong> is a kind of a disability where people may have challenges with speaking, rely on motorised equipment and cannot access physical devices like a keyboard or mouse to interact with the applications.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cognitive Disability</em></strong> is the type in which people have poor memory and have difficulties in understanding and expressing their thoughts to the other person.</p>
<p><strong><em>Eyesight disability</em></strong> is one of the most ¹ disabilities and again, according to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Health Organisation</a>, around 2.2 million people globally have visual impairments or blindness.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hearing Disability</em></strong> is the inability to hear. This can be partial or complete deafness.</p>
<p><strong><em>Temporary Disability</em></strong> can occur due to environmental conditions, illness or accidents and mostly a temporary situation.</p>
<h2><strong>How to perform Accessibility Testing?</strong></h2>
<p>Now that we know the common disabilities, it’s time for us to know how we can leverage the testing strategies for accessibility. But before that, we need to know a few artifacts that are considered industry standards.</p>
<p>Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has issued a set of guidelines known as ‘The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)’ which organisations must strictly follow to make the application accessible to people with disabilities. The different phases of SDLC should follow these set of guidelines as part of their <em>Non-Functional Testing </em>process.</p>
<p>These guidelines can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>For each and every guideline, there are testable success criteria, which are at three levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>A (lowest)</li>
<li>AA (mid-range)</li>
<li>AAA (highest)</li>
</ul>
<p>These levels may vary from different organisations and in different situations. Conformance at higher levels indicates conformance at lower levels. For example, by conforming to AA, a Web page meets both the A and AA conformance levels. Level A sets a minimum level of accessibility and does not achieve broad accessibility for many situations. For this reason, UC recommends AA conformance for all Web-based information.</p>
<p>Many organisations practically do accessibility testing by recruiting real-time testers in their own abilities to validate whether their product meets the correct user experience.</p>
<p>Having said that, let’s now see how we can perform accessibility testing for the types of disabilities we read about earlier.</p>
<h3><strong>Physical Disability</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Check whether there is voice recognition software and test its consistency</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>For people with a speech disability, check whether the physical keyboard is efficient to use</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>People with a motor disability should have an option to find human help in case of emergencies</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Test the application with a specialised mouse for people who have limitations in muscular control</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Make sure the timeouts are configured accordingly as the user consumes more time for situations like entering the values in the form etc.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Cognitive Disability</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Check whether the controls are clear for the users to use</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Easily understandable menus so that the user can select what they need</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Maximum usage of images and graphs instead of texts which make understanding the context difficult</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Test whether the user can complete a task without unnecessary distractions like alerts, advertisements, etc.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Validate whether there is an option to find human help</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Eyesight / Vision Disability</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Test whether the application provides keyboard shortcuts for all the operations used by a mouse</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Text to audio converters</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Magnifiers in place for fewer vision abilities</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Fonts used are satisfying the rules of W3C Accessibility Checker</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Color blindness filters</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Hearing Disability</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Test whether the application alerts the users with vibration even when that feature is turned off (mobile apps)</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Providing manuals in sign language for better understanding the application</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Flash alerts in mobile phones like led lights flashing during incoming calls</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Audio to text converters in place</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Temporary Disability</strong></h3>
<p>This type of disability is spontaneous and can happen anytime in one’s life. This can include a foreign person using an ATM in a region where the language could be a barrier. In this case, we need to see if there is an option in the ATM system to use a common language, commonly English to control.</p>
<p>There might be a situation where a person can have a broken arm or undergo surgery on one eye. So we need to ensure whether the application we develop can be adapted by the user during those situations without giving stress to the users.</p>
<p>Though we are in a digital era, not all disabilities are identified and addressed. So in reality, unfortunately not all types of disabilities are considered while an application is built and released.</p>
<h2><strong>Tools to perform Accessibility Testing</strong></h2>
<p>With all the guidelines defined according to W3C standards, one or more tools can be used to validate the required success criteria of the application. Accessibility testing can be achieved either manually or automated. There are several open-source and commercial tools in the market to test the application for accessibility compliance. </p>
<p>Following are some of the tools that can be used.</p>
<h3><strong>Screen Magnification</strong></h3>
<p>People with limited vision may not be able to read the content with the normal font size. Such people need to zoom in on the content to read it.</p>
<p><em>Magnifier </em>App in Windows and <em>Zoom </em>option in macOS are excellent tools. </p>
<h3><strong>Color Contrast Analyser</strong></h3>
<p>Color Contrast Analyser (CCA) helps to keep sufficient contrast between foreground and background colors by providing appropriate test results.</p>
<h3><strong>Applitools Contrast Advisor</strong></h3>
<p>The forthcoming Applitools Contrast Advisor uses AI powered computer vision (Visual AI) to help identify potential contrast violations. If the measured contrast ratio in text or images is less than the minimum defined by WCAG then a contrast accessibility failure is flagged for that element. It can be used for both web, mobile web, and native mobile applications.</p>
<p>Users can toggle between WCAG 2.0 or 2.1 as well as AA or AAA to be advised on how well their website or application complies. </p>
<p>This product can be enabled within your existing automation framework with a simple line of code, or easily configured to automatically scan your site or application without writing a single line of code.</p>
<p>Applitools Contrast Advisor will be available in limited release starting in mid-May.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/request-demo/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact Applitools to schedule an early-preview demo today</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Screen Readers</strong></h3>
<p>Screen readers are the tools used for narrating the content of a page. A screen reader can narrate everything for the user like the texts on the website, links, checkboxes, radio buttons, images, etc.</p>
<p>Here are some famous screen readers for browsers and mobile devices:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>IE and Chrome:</em> JAWS (Job Access With Speech)</li>
<li><em>Firefox</em>: NVDA (Non-Visual Desktop Access)</li>
<li><em>Safari</em>: Voice Over </li>
<li><em>iPhone</em>: Voice Over</li>
<li><em>Android</em>: Talkback </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Speech Recognition Tools</strong></h3>
<p>Speech recognition tools are used to interact with the application by dictating text or commands to it. It can be used to dictate text, control buttons, links, open an application and other controls. Windows Speech Recognition, Apple Dictation and Dragon are some common Speech Recognition tools.</p>
<h3><strong>Axe Browser Plugin</strong></h3>
<p>Axe is a browser plugin for Chrome and Firefox web browsers. It scans the web page to find for WCAG 2 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2) and Section 508 (Standards defined for Federal Agencies) accessibility and reports the violations. The axe-Chrome extension utilizes the axe open-source JavaScript library developed by Deque Systems.</p>
<h3><strong>WorldSpace Attest from Deque</strong></h3>
<p>The Worldspace Attest is a toolkit used by developers while they code. It supports the shift-left approach to identify the accessibility issues (as per the guidelines defined by WCAG, Section 508, etc.,) much earlier in an automated fashion. This has the feature to integrate with the existing test automation framework which will check for the compliance issues while the functional tests run.  It currently supports all major browsers like IE, Chrome, Safari, Firefox. It has extensive support for both iOS and Android devices as well.</p>
<h2><strong>It’s Everyone’s Right!</strong></h2>
<p>As per the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN <a target="_blank" href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRPD</a>), access to information and communications, including web &amp; mobile applications, is defined as a basic human right and applications must comply to Accessibility Standards.</p>
<p>Performing accessibility testing will help us make our applications friendly to those with disabilities, thus offering them equal rights to the digital world. </p>
<p><strong><em>Remember, everyone will become disabled in some way, sometime, in our lives as part of nature’s cycle.</em></strong></p>

</p>
<div>
<p>We’ve always provided open source projects with access to <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/solutions/open-source" rel="noopener noreferrer">our full-service live and automated testing capabilities</a> to help them keep their software bug-free. Now, we’re extending our Open Sauce program to offer free and reduced-cost testing for organizations innovating to address COVID-19. </p>
<p>Our Open Sauce program offers access to thousands of browser, OS, and emulator/simulator combinations, five concurrent sessions for testing in parallel, and unlimited testing minutes. To support the COVID-19 response, we’re also now offering qualifying organizations real devices for live testing on mobile devices.</p>
<p>One company, <a target="_blank" href="https://nsightify.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">nSightify</a>, is now leveraging our COVID-19 support offering for testing. nSightify has a mobile app designed to facilitate communications for first responders such as firefighters and EMS workers. They reached out to Sauce when they saw the need to add a telehealth feature to their mobile app to enable paramedics and other first responders to quickly consult with doctors to determine whether a COVID-19 patient needs hospitalization or can be treated elsewhere. This feature allows first responders to get eyes on the patient quickly and ensure they’re treated appropriately, which means better patient care… and the added benefit that hospital and emergency resources can stay available for the most critical cases.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>“Leveraging the Sauce Labs Continuous Testing cloud has allowed us to test quickly on real devices and quickly get our telehealth feature to market,” says John Dadey, CEO of nSightify.  “We went from manually testing one device at a time to automating the process, and it’s helped us reduce our overall testing time by 50-70%.” </p>
<p>The Open Sauce program offers several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ability to get up and running fast with live and automated testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instant access to our Virtual Device Cloud for testing desktop and mobile websites and applications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to share test results—videos, screenshots and log files—via Slack, HipChat or email, making collaboration a cinch</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To see if your organization qualifies for free or reduced-cost testing under the Open Sauce program, please fill out the <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/open-sauce" rel="noopener noreferrer">form on our website</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[From online retail to finance, and from streaming entertainment to healthcare providers and agencies, all manner of businesses and government entities have]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>From online retail to finance, and from streaming entertainment to healthcare providers and agencies, all manner of businesses and government entities have seen their web traffic and app activity explode. COVID-19 has changed everything for many organizations, and it did so overnight, with no time to prepare.</p>
<p>Microsoft says the use of its Teams collaboration software in Italy <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/03/31/microsoft_corrects_cloud_surge_claim/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">increased by 775% in March alone</a>, sending the company scrambling to increase capacity while implementing <a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/update-2-on-microsoft-cloud-services-continuity/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">temporary restrictions and quotas</a> for Azure customers to prevent systems from going offline.</p>
<p>While performance is increasingly being considered during the software design phase, more typically <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-engineering-critical?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">performance engineering </a><a target="_blank" href="http://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-engineering-critical?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">is an iterative process</a> that occurs after a service or app has been launched. If the system is bogging down due to heavy load, engineers figure out <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-engineering-techniques?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">what they can do to make it better</a>, whether that&#8217;s redesigning code through component decoupling or simply deploying cloud services such as caching systems and content delivery networks. Performance improves, and everyone relaxes.</p>
<p>But enterprises such as Instacart, Zoom, Amazon, and Netflix just don&#8217;t have the luxury of time in the new COVID-19 reality. Last month, <a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/netflix-streaming-hits-all-time-highs-coronavirus-1203543218/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Netflix usage</a> hit its all-time high, and it&#8217;s still going up. Analysts and users alike are increasingly worried whether it and other Internet services <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/05/should-netflix-fear-crashes-in-a-high-traffic-time.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">can handle the load</a>.</p>
<p>So far, they&#8217;ve been able to, through a combination of savvy business decisions and clever engineering. TechBeacon spoke with several tech leaders to suss out the best practices that were keeping these types of services afloat amid the huge—and sudden—crush of activity, and what other organizations can learn from how they&#8217;re coping.</p>
<p>Here are four best practices from the front lines of <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-testing-to-engineering?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">performance engineering</a>.</p>
<p><em>[ Get up to speed on <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/performance-engineering-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">Performance Engineering with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide</a>. Plus: Get this report: <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/performance-engineering-tb/performance-engineering-devops-gartner?lx=zTFJra&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adopt a Performance Engineering Approach for DevOps</a> ]</em></p>
<h3>1. Embrace simplicity</h3>
<p>James Pulley, co-host of the performance testing podcast <a target="_blank" href="https://www.perfbytes.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">PerfBytes</a>, harkens back to another event that changed much overnight. During 9/11, the major online news organizations &#8220;had to move to a highly simplified web page because they were getting so much traffic,&#8221; he said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;They got rid of fancy graphics to reduce the number of bytes they were sending. Today, the same strategy is being employed at a Netflix level, reducing bit rates at the top end.&#8221; <br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/perfpulley" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">James Pulley</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure enough, the company has <a target="_blank" href="https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/reducing-netflix-traffic-where-its-needed" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">voluntarily cut its bandwidth usage</a> in Europe. This doesn&#8217;t just help keep streaming from overloading public networks, but it also helps Netflix servers avoid a meltdown.</p>
<p>Byte creep is a real problem, Pulley said. The <a target="_blank" href="https://speedcurve.com/blog/web-performance-page-bloat/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">average size of a web page</a> grew from about 1MB in 2011 to 3MB in 2017, and it&#8217;s still on the rise. As such, the first step organizations need to take to weather a traffic crush is to cut the fat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If you have six web beacons, go to one. If you have a style sheet full of artifacts, get all of that out.&#8221;<br />—James Pulley</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use Minify and Zip where possible; you want the data you send to be as small as it can be. And make sure your cache model is refined and working. If you see a file that hasn&#8217;t changed in five years that&#8217;s still being requested every five days, &#8220;you&#8217;re wasting bandwidth,&#8221; he added. Finally, be more aggressive about returning resources to the pool by giving shorter sessions to users.</p>
<h3>2. Treat data like code</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-yeh-7339897/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Matt Yeh</a>, senior director of product marketing at DataOps platform vendor Delphix, said that one way to scale your development cycles to handle increased demand is by focusing on agility in the data tier. This means getting teams to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/want-effective-test-automation-devops-manage-your-test-data" rel="noopener noreferrer">treat data the same way they treat code</a>.</p>
<p>Feeding and refreshing test data for cloud-based test environments from an on-premises production instance &#8220;is harder than many leaders think,&#8221; he said. Without the ability to automate data delivery as part of a DevOps workflow in the cloud, &#8220;a data agility problem is created that drives bad behavior and slows the delivery pipeline.&#8221;</p>
<p>Data agility is the most important factor for application development, because while code is being built and deployed via self-service, &#8220;the data tier still remains rigid and resistant to the same level of speed and automation at most organizations,&#8221; Yeh said.</p>
<p>Make your tools and processes address the data tier in the same way teams have improved the flow of their application code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;You can eliminate data-related waste, rework, and wait times.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-yeh-7339897/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Matt Yeh</a></p>

<h3>3. Take a &#8216;shift-left&#8217; approach to quality</h3>
<p>The Rule of 10 says that after each step of quality assurance, it is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.design4manufacturability.com/DFM_article.htm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">10 times harder and more expensive to fix a defect</a>. To address this, said <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/weisstal?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tal Weiss</a>, CTO of software quality tool vendor OverOps, many organizations are starting to understand the merits of adopting a shift-left approach to quality.</p>
<p>This means that by increasing quality measures taken in the development and testing phases of software delivery, you can <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/shift-your-testing-how-increase-quality-not-anxiety" rel="noopener noreferrer">significantly reduce the odds of production issues</a>. This mindset can be applied to the data tier as much as it can be to code.</p>
<h3>4. Embrace performance engineering tools</h3>
<p>&#8220;Performance engineering and testing doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to change, but it definitely needs to happen,&#8221; said Guillaume Quintard, software engineer for content delivery network vendor Varnish Software.</p>
<p>Performance engineering teams need to understand where their breaking point is and have a proactive plan in place for what to do when it is reached to avoid an outage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;As an industry, we&#8217;ve had these tools for a long time.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/gquintard_?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Guillaume Quintard</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mike Canney, business development and product strategy professional at performance analytics tool vendor Accedian, expanded on that thought. Performance engineering teams typically have a very good understanding from a systems perspective, but &#8220;what&#8217;s missing is a real understanding of the network and application visibility,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>To get a complete picture of network performance, you have to understand things like bandwidth and latency, he said. &#8220;You need to be able to see how having multiple users impacts bandwidth, and how much bandwidth and latency impacts response time.&#8221; </p>
<p>Canney also noted that sheer bandwidth isn&#8217;t always the issue. There are many variables that can affect a network.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Before you throw money at expanding bandwidth, make sure that&#8217;s actually the problem by utilizing network visibility tools.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/mikecanney" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mike Canney</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Other factors to weigh</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to understand business transactions—measuring the unit of work that is actually performed in each transaction. For example, a single search on a retail website may ultimately create thousands of micro-transactions as the item is located, inventory is measured, the offering of upsells or related goods is weighed, and so on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Once you understand the business transactions and what goes into them, it&#8217;s much easier to do network modeling and predictive analysis.&#8221;<br />—Mike Canney</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, all organizations need to take a long-term approach to performance engineering. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Testing is more relevant than ever, but relying on traditional tests is no longer an option.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/weisstal?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tal Weiss</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Building in automated quality gates and feedback loops will allow for thorough, fast testing that doesn&#8217;t hold up release timelines. This can be done by leveraging a variety of automated testing methods within your CI/CD pipeline, such as static and dynamic code analysis.</p>
<h3>Process and procedure trump everything</h3>
<p>Goutham Belliappa, vice president of AI engineering at Capgemini, sums up the matter by noting that the overarching issue surrounding traffic surges is not usually a technical one but a human one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;COVID-19 has forced many companies to go digital, even those that thought they were unable to. For many businesses, bandwidth is being slammed, but the problem is more of a process and procedure one.&#8221; <br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/GBELLIAP" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Goutham Belliappa</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, VPNs hastily rolled out to workers who were never envisioned as working from home have only exacerbated problems for IT departments that also are no longer in the office.</p>
<p>The bottom line: The tools needed to weather the storm are already in most organizations&#8217; collective arsenals, but development teams need to more fully utilize them and better understand how the data tier <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-predictive-analytics-can-boost-app-performance" rel="noopener noreferrer">affects application performance</a>.</p>
<p>The good news is that it&#8217;s easy to take some smart first steps. Reducing data overhead and minimizing data transfer—even if it&#8217;s only temporary—are essential ones to keeping your services up and running during this crisis.</p>
