										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>People working in IT support and incident management right now face unusual difficulties supporting large remote workforces and managing unpredictable workloads. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/fc4l48/coronavirus_and_supporting_remote_workforce/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">On Reddit</a>, systems admins and other IT professionals are bemoaning the hiccups and hassles of working in isolation during the pandemic while trying to resolve issues and maintain high service-level agreements.</p>
<p>Among other problems, you can&#8217;t go grab your indispensable subject-matter expert for troubleshooting, because that person is also home and inundated with messages and alerts.</p>
<p>Networks, VPNs, and servers are <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/itops-monitoring-tb/it-ops-monitoring?lx=O4Iukj&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">being hammered hard right now due to higher usage of SaaS apps and collaboration tools</a>. User expectations are even more grandiose than normal: IT organizations are expected to make applications and services work flawlessly—and to do so overnight.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, IT pros are working assiduously to keep the wheels moving for their employers during a time of crisis. Yet working longer hours isn&#8217;t the answer. You need <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/it-support-with-ai/ai-transform-it-service-management?lx=f4_9S2&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">new ways of working</a>—ones that may prove better than the current status quo for the long term. And that involves turning <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/want-transform-it-incident-management-shift-left" rel="noopener noreferrer">the incident management process</a> on its head.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to flip the process.</p>
<p><em>[ Join the discussion in this June 18 Webinar, <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/are-itsm-and-enterpr?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">Are ITSM and ESM One and the Same</a>? </em><em>Plus</em><em>: Learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/enterprise-service-management-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to optimize your Enterprise Service Management</a> ]</em></p>
<h3>Problem first, metrics second</h3>
<p>In many organizations, the process of incident management and resolution begins with people looking at screens full of metrics. You see a spike in something, such as network I/O, and immediately begin to investigate it, assuming the worst.</p>
<p>A more adverse scenario occurs when users call out problems on Twitter, Reddit, or other popular communities, creating a noxious PR situation that IT and the business must swiftly respond to and manage. This ad hoc, reactive fire drill takes time, and resolving that particular issue may not be the most important item of the day.</p>
<p>In software development, it&#8217;s akin to the bad practice of designing the architecture of a system first and then the user experience.</p>
<p>Given everything that&#8217;s at stake in the foreseeable future of stay-at-home mandates, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/sre-practice-5-insights-googles-experience" rel="noopener noreferrer">site reliability engineers (SREs) </a>and IT support technicians need to flip the incident management process.</p>
<p>Rather than beginning with the metrics and working backwards to uncover the problem, if there even is one, start by looking for the most important problems to solve. Then discover the resources and components that support that end-user process, and, finally, analyze the most relevant metrics.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<ol>
<li>A B-to-C provider of a streaming video service experiences a 200% increase in daytime traffic that results in sluggish load times and glitches.</li>
<li>IT has tagged the components beneath that service, so IT operators know exactly which virtual machines, databases, and load balancers come into play.</li>
<li>Next, the operations team can identify the most relevant metrics, such as CPU idle time, to measure and take steps to correct.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Take this 5-step proactive approach</h3>
<p>It sounds so simple—just flip the process—but it&#8217;s not that easy. IT operators and SREs aren&#8217;t accustomed to thinking in terms of which problems to solve or prevent. Being proactive or predictive hasn&#8217;t been the common workflow.</p>
<p>Here is how IT operations and DevOps teams can take a proactive approach to managing the availability and health of enterprise services.</p>
<h4>1. Coordinate across departments</h4>
<p>Identifying the most critical problems to solve right now is the hardest step and will take the longest. Common problems these days are related to cost and scale: How do I right-size my environment to reduce costs or handle more workloads?</p>
<p>Broaden your field of inputs to narrow down to the specific issue, such as slow page loads on the financial reporting website. Product managers, account managers, and business unit leads who are closest to the customer experience can deliver feedback on the top issues affecting customer/user satisfaction.</p>
<p>Teams should also review recent support tickets to identify common themes of pain.</p>
<h4>2. Fine-tune your approach to metrics</h4>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Utilization Saturation and Errors (USE) Method </a>is one way to approach the problem-first incident management process. As detailed by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/brendangregg/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Brendan Gregg</a>, a senior performance architect at Netflix, this methodology begins by posing questions, seeking answers, and working backwards to the metrics.</p>
<p>For each resource you want to measure, identify three metrics: one for utilization, one for saturation, and one for errors. &#8220;The USE Method has made you aware of what you didn&#8217;t check: what were once unknown-unknowns are now known-unknowns,&#8221; Gregg explained.</p>
<h4>3. Standardize workflows</h4>
<p>Create a common process for incident management across all your teams. Without the advantage of having almost everyone in the same room to huddle together in an ad hoc fashion when big issues crop up, it&#8217;s imperative to institute clear steps and roles.</p>
<p>Doing so will prevent the frustrations, confusion, and oversights that needlessly delay resolution. Since most incidents are composed of multiple contributing factors, teams need to adopt a small number of user-friendly tools to document and organize the information.</p>
<p>At our company, we&#8217;re now using tools such as Miro, an online whiteboard application, to replace our physical whiteboarding sessions. Of course there&#8217;s also Zoom, Slack, Jira, and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-use-chatops-boost-business-engagement-across-teams" rel="noopener noreferrer">a host of other cloud-based tools</a> already in place at many organizations. Mandate which tools everyone should use, and provide some guidelines on how to use them.</p>
<h4>4. Increase automation </h4>
<p>In some organizations, scaling requirements in response to demand have increased tenfold. <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/it-service-management-tb/ai-transform-it-service-management?lx=-rqtPA&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automation is playing a critical role now</a>; moving away from a web GUI, for example, is more scalable and aligns with modern tools such as Chef and Puppet.</p>
<p>User tickets can be auto-generated, for instance, from emails, and linked to code management systems such as GitHub. Modern development and operations teams are also expanding automation in unit testing and provisioning.</p>
<h4>5. Watch for burnout</h4>
<p>Whether because there&#8217;s more work and/or a need to fill the hours during long quarantine days, many software engineers, testers, and architects are working longer days right now. Yet exhaustion and burnout can lead to errors and oversights along with low morale.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s up to managers to make sure that employees are taking breaks, working reasonable days, and having the time and energy to attend to personal needs.</p>

<h3>Work it backwards</h3>
<p>These days, with so many people working remotely, IT operations teams need new strategies to keep business operations running smoothly in a high-stress situation. That means flipping the incident management process by taking a problem-first approach and working backward toward <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-you-should-drop-it-speak-measure-success-business-terms" rel="noopener noreferrer">the metrics that relate</a> to quickly uncover the root causes. </p>
<p>Creating airtight communications and collaboration is the foundation for all of this. Provide the best tools possible to your teams, and deliver clear and frequent education on best practices to keep everyone on the same page and productive. And IT leaders should pave the way with encouragement, guidance, and moral support.</p>

<h2 id="h.ep69ae7wwxsl">The Next Generation of Cross Browser Testing is Ultrafast.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our hackathons were created to make a point. There is a better way to automate your testing. Browsers do not suffer from the same executional bugs that plagued them five, 10, or 20 years ago. What does create problems, lots of problems, is the rendering of the application across various viewports and screens. This reality means amajor shift in how you need to test, and you will learn and see for yourself what we mean by competing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Ultrafast Cross Browser Testing Hackathon, even more valuable than the prizes you might win, is the learning you will gain from competing. If you take on this challenge, you will learn how next generation cross browser testing works.

<p>First, you will learn new skills. You get hands-on experience seeing how easily you can run tests once and evaluating behavior across the browsers that matter to your customers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, you experience a new way of running application validation. If you have your own multi-browser lab today, or if you use a third-party service that requires multiple tests run on multiple setups in parallel, you can see the difference in running the Applitools Ultrafast grid in comparison. And, if you have not considered running tests across multiple browsers – due to cost or complexity – you can reevaluate your decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, you can win prizes and bragging rights as a hackathon winner. To show the world, we will proudly display your name on our website. Your success will demonstrate your engineering acumen to your peers and anyone else that matters to you.</p>

<p><em>[ <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/digital-transformation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get up to speed on digital transformation</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide.

<h3>1. Focus on rituals and ceremonies</h3>
<p>The simplest thing to do is to establish as your bible one of the hundreds of books on agile development, lean methods, or <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/devops-must-reads-practitioners-share-top-books" rel="noopener noreferrer">DevOps adoption</a>. Make it the one true source of your best practices.</p>
<p>If you’re taking a more hands-on approach, you might anoint one person to be your coach, or &#8220;high priest,&#8221; and then do what that person tells you. There are standards for sprint length and backlog size and there are frameworks—<a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/units/scaling-agile-overview-frameworks" rel="noopener noreferrer">so many frameworks</a>: SAFe and LeSS, and dynamic systems development method (DSDM).</p>
<p>Your teams will go to stand-ups every day, and hold grooming sessions, and invite you to sprint reviews. The problem is that, although they will look agile, there is no guarantee they will <em>be</em> agile. Far too often this focus on form gives you the same slow, unresponsive results you had before, only dressed up in agile clothing.</p>
<h3>2. Track and trace the team</h3>
<p>Agile methods, particularly Scrum, give you lots of <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/9-metrics-can-make-difference-todays-software-development-teams" rel="noopener noreferrer">tools for measuring progress</a>: burnup charts, backlogs, velocity, story points completed, and so on. Software vendors are only too pleased to sell you tools that track, graph, slice, and dice these metrics, or provide similar ones for DevOps and lean approaches, and tell you how performance stacks up against last week or the industry average.</p>
<p>These tools are great at producing management fodder and the illusion of control. Unfortunately, high scores and pretty graphs don’t mean your team is delivering agile results, and you can nail your metrics and estimates every sprint right up to the moment you deliver a disappointing pile of useless features.</p>
<p>The central reason these approaches don’t pay off is that they focus on what is easily seen and monitored by the managers at the top, avoiding the hard work of cultural change and commitment that happen at the team level.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jamesshore" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">James Shore</a> calls these approaches &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Cargo-Cult-Agile.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cargo Cult Agile</a>.&#8221; Like the primitive people who started superstitiously donning coconut headphones and signaling nonexistent planes in the hope they would bring them modern goods, adopters of these methods are copying agile actions and tools and hoping that will give them agile results. This hope is just as forlorn as it sounds, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucerogers/2016/01/07/why-84-of-companies-fail-at-digital-transformation/#7ad5cf16397b" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">84% of digital transformations that fail</a> are witnesses to it.</p>
<p>We wrote our book, <em><a target="_blank" href="https://itrevolution.com/agile-conversations" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Agile Conversations</a>,</em> to propose and explain how to implement a harder answer, we use a method we have seen give dramatic results in team after team.</p>
<p><em>[ Find out <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/robotic-process-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to roll out Robotic Process Automation</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide. Plus: Download <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/robotic-process-automation-tb/enterprise-rpa-requirements?lx=jNs_Bd&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enterprise Requirements for RPA</a> ]</em></p>
<h3>The harder answer: Build trust and reduce fear</h3>
<p>Hold difficult conversations with your team. Build trust by sharing your own reasoning and inquiring into the inferences and theories of your team members. Having built mutual trust and understanding, you can move to revealing and mitigating the fears that hold back your team, and come to understand the assumptions behind those fears.</p>
<p>Only after addressing these cultural issues can you—with the help of the participants—expect to benefit from an agile framework or a DevOps approach that fits your organization well and has your team members’ commitment.</p>
<p>If improving your conversations sounds like a challenging route to digital transformation success, good! You’ve understood why we warned you it was the hard answer. But the good news is that there are solid, concrete methods for preparing for and holding these difficult conversations, starting with <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.communicationtheory.org/conversation-analysis/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">conversational analysis</a>.</em></p>
<p>To create a conversational analysis, think of a previous conversation that went poorly, or one you are worried about having—any conversation that raises questions of trust and fear would be a good candidate. Divide a piece of paper into two columns; on the right, put the words that you and the other person said (a sample of a few key lines is plenty), and on the left, put the thoughts and feelings that you had as the corresponding lines were spoken.</p>
<p>Once you’ve recorded the information, it’s time to score yourself for <em>transparency</em> and <em>curiosity</em>, the two key elements of effective conversations.</p>
<h4>Curiosity</h4>
<p>On the right, circle all the question marks in sentences spoken by you. If there are any questions (often there won’t be, revealing a total lack of curiosity!), reflect on whether each question was genuine. Could the answer have changed your mind, or were you leading the witness and making a disguised statement (&#8220;Surely we can finish that feature by Thursday.&#8221;)?</p>
<h4>Transparency</h4>
<p>On the left, underline each emotion or thought that you did not share on the right-hand side. You don’t have to have used the same words, but if you&#8217;re like most people (including us!) you’ll have left out your most valuable, strongest feelings and ideas, missing the chance to show vulnerability and build trust.</p>
<h3>Take the next steps</h3>
<p>Finally, revise your conversation to increase your curiosity and transparency. Add a genuine question, describe a feeling, or bring up a challenging example. Ask a friend to role-play the revised conversation with you, so you can solidify your learning and find a natural way to express yourself in the more effective way you’ve now learned.</p>
<p>If you and your team develop conversational skills in this way—and build on them with other techniques like test-driven development for people (for more on this, watch <a target="_blank" href="https://douglassquirrel.s3.amazonaws.com/Squirrel-AgilePortugal2016.mp4" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Douglas</a>’<a target="_blank" href="https://douglassquirrel.s3.amazonaws.com/Squirrel-AgilePortugal2016.mp4" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> presentation</a>) and <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jeffreyfredrick.com/2016/04/08/coherence-busting-explained/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">coherence busting</a> that start with conversational analysis—you will be able to approach future conversations effectively.</p>
<p>In these ways, the harder answer, the true path to agile success, will not seem so daunting. And you’ll be able to engage in all the conversations we cover in <em>Agile Conversations</em>, not just trust and fear, but why, commitment, and accountability.</p>
<p>With the help of these key conversations you’ll be able to create a real transformation that works for everyone, and with the buy-in you need to succeed. It’s the harder path, but it’s the only one we know that works every time.</p>

</p>
<div>
<p>In this series of Selenium 4 articles, we will look into the entire <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium</a> suite. The suite includes Selenium IDE, Selenium WebDriver, and Selenium Grid. Each component has something new that is useful for automation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Selenium IDE</u></strong> allows us to record, playback the recording, edit, and debug our test.</li>
<li><strong><u>Selenium WebDriver</u></strong> is an API that executes our test by driving a browser for automating an Application Under Test (AUT).</li>
<li><strong><u>Selenium Grid</u></strong> executes our test across multiple browsers, operating systems, and machines.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can look at Selenium as a family of products. Our test can be recorded in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium IDE</a> then executed using <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2017/11/28/inside-selenium-webdriver/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium WebDriver</a> and scaled up utilizing <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/07/16/using-selenium-grid-and-remote-webdrivers/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium Grid</a>. The Selenium 4 pre-release version is available from <a target="_blank" href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-java" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maven’s Repository</a>. By the end of this series, you will read updates concerning Selenium IDE, Selenium WebDriver, and Selenium Grid.</p>

<h2><a target="_blank" id="Selenium_IDE" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Selenium IDE</strong></h2>
<p>Selenium IDE is open source and available to record then playback our test. The new name is called <strong>Selenium IDE TNG</strong> (The Next Generation). We can view it as the on ramp to the Selenium family for people without development experience.</p>
<p>Many people wondered what happened to the previous release. Unfortunately, Selenium IDE was only available through Firefox and used an XPI file. XPI is a cross platform compressed installation via Mozilla Application Suite. It stopped working after Mozilla changed from using the XPI file. In spite of the change, we can now download Selenium IDE TNG via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/</a> as a <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/selenium-ide/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selenium-ide/mooikfkahbdckldjjndioackbalphokd" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome</a> extension. The extension is available as a Web Extension but will be available as an Electron app. Electron apps allow us to use the Debugging Protocol.</p>
</p>
<p><noscript><img class="alignnone wp-image-12340 size-medium" title="Selenium IDE" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.1-Selenium-IDE-512x143.jpg" alt="Selenium IDE" width="512" height="143" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.1-Selenium-IDE-512x143.jpg 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.1-Selenium-IDE.jpg 641w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"/></noscript></p>
<p>Also, we can extend Selenium IDE with the use of plugins. Plugins are good for introducing new commands or integrating with a 3<sup>rd</sup> Party. In addition to the plugins and available for multiple browsers, Selenium IDE TNG has the following features:</p>
<h3><a target="_blank" id="Backup_Element_Selectors" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backup Element Selectors</h3>
<p>Backup Element Selectors is when Selenium IDE records multiple locators for each element. Some examples of locators are ID, XPath, and CSS selector. Imagine a scenario where our test passes as expected, then an update is performed on the application. Depending on the update, the test will fail because Selenium cannot locate the element.</p>
<p>Not anymore <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Now our test will pass after an update. If test execution does not locate an element then it will fall back to a different locator until the element is found. Thanks to Backup Element Selectors, one element contains more than one locator.</p>
<h3><a target="_blank" id="Control_Flows" rel="noopener noreferrer">Control Flows</h3>
<p>Control Flow statements help Selenium IDE know the execution order of instructions in our program. There are 2 types of Control Flows: <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#Conditionals" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conditionals</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/#Loops" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loops</a>. Conditional statements decide what happens next if a specific condition is met or not met. Loop statements execute an instruction or instructions for a certain number of times.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" id="Conditionals" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Conditionals</strong></h4>
<p>The Conditional statements are if, else if, else, and end.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>if</u></strong> executes a statement when a condition is true.</li>
<li><strong><u>else if</u></strong> only executes a statement when the first if condition is false.</li>
<li><strong><u>else</u></strong> extends the if condition when the condition is false.</li>
<li><strong><u>end</u></strong> is a command that terminates the conditional block.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a target="_blank" id="Loops" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Loops</strong></h4>
<p>The Loop statements are do – repeat if, while, times, and forEach.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>do – repeat if</u></strong> starts with a do command and ends with a repeat if command. A block of statements is executed at least one time then evaluated to determine if they should execute again.</li>
<li><strong><u>while</u></strong> only executes a block of statements when the condition is true.</li>
<li><strong><u>times</u></strong> determine the number of times to perform a set of commands.</li>
<li><strong><u>forEach</u></strong> iterates over a collection and have a reference for each collection item.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each condition is verified using JavaScript expressions which can be implemented directly in the control flow command. We are allowed to use the execute script or execute async script commands to run JavaScript and store the result in a variable. Here’s a screenshot of some Control Flow statements:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-12341 size-full" title="Control Flow statements" alt="Control Flow statements" width="639" height="329" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.2-Selenium-Control-Flow.jpg 639w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.2-Selenium-Control-Flow-512x264.jpg 512w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.2-Selenium-Control-Flow.jpg"/></p>

<h3><a target="_blank" id="Code_Export" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code Export</h3>
<p>Last but not least is Code Export which permits code to get pushed to Selenium WebDriver and use on Selenium Grid. The steps include right-clicking a test or suite, selecting Export, then picking a language/test framework and clicking the Export button. Currently, Selenium IDE TNG supports the following languages and test frameworks:</p>
<ul>
<li>C# / NUnit</li>
<li>C# / xUnit</li>
<li>Java / JUnit</li>
<li>JavaScript / Mocha</li>
<li>Python / pytest</li>
<li>Ruby / RSpec</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully, support for Java / <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/10/31/the-power-of-testng-test-next-generation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestNG</a> comes in the future.</p>

<h2><a target="_blank" id="Selenium_Grid" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Selenium Grid</strong></h2>
<p>Selenium Grid supplies a way to set up an infrastructure of different browsers and operating systems on different machines. We can specify the browser, browser version, and operating system with Selenium Remote. The tests are distributed across multiple physical or virtual machines so they can execute in parallel.</p>
<h3>Modern</h3>
<p>The original Selenium Grid was released in 2011 and so much has changed with technology. For example, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/05/30/the-ultimate-docker-tutorial-for-automation-testing-using-testproject/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker</a> and Kubernetes have made technology more accessible. Docker allows us to run applications in containers instead of virtual machines. Kubernetes allows us to set up a grid of machines. As a result of Docker and Kubernetes, we can scale using a cloud infrastructure. The goal is for Selenium Grid 4 to take advantage of new technology features.</p>
<h3>New Architecture</h3>
<p>Currently, at start up, the Selenium stand-alone server goes down 1 of 2 code base paths. The divided code bases are getting addressed with a brand-new architecture for Selenium Grid 4. Its architecture includes 4 individual processes: Router, Distributor, Session Map, and Node.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Router</u></strong> listens to a new session request.</li>
<li><strong><u>Distributor</u></strong> selects a node to run a test.</li>
<li><strong><u>Session Map</u></strong> is responsible for mapping session ID to the node.</li>
<li><strong><u>Node</u></strong> is a machine for executing our Test Scripts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the operation of Selenium’s Grid 4 architecture. A message arrives to the router then pings the grid. The new session request goes to the distributor which contains a list of current nodes. It’s the distributor’s responsibility to select a node running in the system. After selecting a node to run our test, a session is started with the node. The node responds back to the distributor with a URL of the session app and returns control to the user.</p>
<p>Although the architecture is new, it is similar to the original architecture. Selenium 2 has a Node and Hub whereby the Hub consists of 3 processes (Router, Distributor, and Session Map). Therefore, Selenium 2 and Selenium 4 have the same processes but Selenium Grid 4 separated the Hub’s process.</p>
<h3>Observability</h3>
<p>Observability helps us to trace and log what’s going on with a condition. This leads to a straightforward debugging session with Selenium Grid 4. As a request comes in, there will be a trace ID to assist our debugging efforts. It will not be as difficult to track why certain conditions failed.</p>
<h2><a target="_blank" id="Selenium_WebDriver" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Selenium WebDriver</strong></h2>
<p>Selenium WebDriver is a collection of APIs used to automate the testing of a web application. The supported languages in alphabetical order are C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. Although, Selenium is a family of more than 1 product, when people only say Selenium, they are implying to Selenium WebDriver.</p>
<h3><a target="_blank" id="W3C_WebDriver_Protocol" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C WebDriver Protocol</h3>
<p>According to Simon Stewart, creator of Selenium WebDriver and Selenium’s Project Lead, the W3C WebDriver Protocol is the reason for upgrading to Selenium 4. There’s not much difference compared to the original JSON Wire Protocol. Here’s a screenshot of the JSON Wire Protocol (left) and W3C WebDriver Protocol (right).</p>

<p>Notice, the JSON Wire Protocol Over HTTP has been removed from W3C WebDriver Protocol. That means information is not transferred over HTTP by sending HTTP Requests and receiving HTTP Responses. With Selenium 4, information is transferred directly back and forth from the client to the server without the JSON Wire Protocol.</p>
<p>An advantage involves testing applications that will execute more consistently between browsers. Kudos to <strong>W3C</strong>, an acronym for <strong>World Wide Web Consortium</strong> for developing web standards. A standardization of W3C promotes compatibility beyond WebDriver API implementations.</p>
<h3><a target="_blank" id="Chrome_DevTools" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome DevTools</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/11/26/next-generation-front-end-testing-using-webdriver-and-devtools-part-1/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome DevTools</a> are developer tools that’s built into the Chrome browser. They can help track what’s going on in the browser, diagnose problems, provide a direct communication line, and can be accessed when right-clicking the page then selecting Inspect. The following panels are displayed after selecting Inspect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elements – view the DOM and inspect an element.</li>
<li>Console – view messages and execute JavaScript.</li>
<li>Sources – contains 3 sections for navigating files, editing code, and debugging JavaScript.</li>
<li>Network – view and debug activities in the network.</li>
<li>Performance – monitor the load and runtime performance of a website.</li>
<li>Memory – track leaks and provide information how a page use memory.</li>
<li>Application – examine all loaded resources.</li>
<li>Security – inspect the security of a page by debugging issues.</li>
<li>Lighthouse – audit web application.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a class named DevTools which helps increase productivity with the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Viewing the DOM</li>
<li>Handling Developer Options</li>
<li>Adding Listeners</li>
<li>Creating a Session</li>
<li>Inspecting Network Activity</li>
<li>Emulating Network Connections</li>
<li>Measuring Performance</li>
</ul>

<h3><a target="_blank" id="ChromiumDriver" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChromiumDriver</h3>
<p>Selenium WebDriver uses a driver to manage each browser. ChromeDriver is an executable that Selenium WebDriver uses to control Google Chrome and EdgeDriver controls Microsoft Edge. Both drivers extend ChromiumDriver as an update in Selenium 4. The ChromiumDriver class has methods to create a connection with DevTools.</p>

<p>The Change Log for JavaScript indicates “Native support has been removed for Opera and PhantomJS as the WebDriver implementations for these browsers are no longer under active development. For Opera, users should be able to simply rely on testing Chrome as the Opera browser is based on Chromium …”.</p>
<p>For more information regarding Selenium 4, we can view the Change Log to see updates concerning each programming language:</p>
<p>This article discussed some of the upcoming features in Selenium 4: Selenium IDE, Selenium WebDriver, and Selenium Grid. The next article will have additional features for Selenium WebDriver. Stay tuned! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
