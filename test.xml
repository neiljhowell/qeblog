										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Robotic process automation (RPA) technology helps organizations automate defined, multi-step manual tasks that are done in high volume. RPA does this by creating software robots, or RPA bots, that emulate human actions to interact with existing application interfaces.</p>
<p>Organizations typically pair RPA bots with tasks that stretch across multiple legacy technology applications or platforms that aren&#8217;t easily linked. Sometimes referred to as &#8220;swivel chair&#8221; activities, these are processes where people essentially respond to alerts or prompts from one system, then use some of that data to take action in another system. </p>
<p>In this way, <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/robotic-process-automation-tb/rpa-enterprise-it?lx=jNs_Bd&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPA excels at helping organizations automate and eliminate error</a> from established processes, all without ripping and replacing legacy systems.</p>
<p><em>[ Learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/enterprise-service-management-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to optimize your Enterprise Service Management (ESM)</a>. Plus: Get TechBeacon&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/buyers-guide-esm-products?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buyers Guide to ESM Products</a> ]</em></p>
<h3>Where RPA makes sense (and where it doesn&#8217;t)</h3>
<p>RPA technologies can be used for many different applications, but <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/robotic-process-automation-tb/get-started-rpa?lx=jNs_Bd&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">the easiest places to start</a> typically crop up in finance and human resources.</p>
<p>One category that makes a good RPA candidate is procure-to-pay use cases. This is where low-level employees spend a lot of time processing inbound invoices, reconciling invoices, and issuing payments—running through routine, repetitive tasks each time they do them. Similarly, if finance personnel have to do a lot of cutting and pasting from one operational system into another finance system to tally up billable hours or shipped product before sending out an invoice, RPA can automate those actions.</p>
<p>HR use cases tend to crop up in very formalized but frequent procedures, such as onboarding, that require recurring actions in many systems for each new employee. For example, RPA can help initiate new accounts, process inbound employee forms, and so on.</p>
<p>HR can also lean heavily on RPA to help with time-consuming manual activities such as the reimbursement claims approval process. Before automation, this required employees to visually confirm scans of employee receipts and ensure that totals matched up before approving a claim.</p>
<p>Now, RPA bots armed with optical character recognition (OCR) scans can be placed at the front end of that procedure to approve the majority of receipts, perhaps with humans on hand to do a second pass when receipts are smudged or there&#8217;s a discrepancy.</p>
<p>These examples are just the beginning when considering possible RPA use cases. Others include using RPA bots to complete routine sales analysis based on input from many different systems, leveraging bots in IT situations for routine systems maintenance and monitoring, and using the technology to aid in supply chain planning and stock optimization.</p>
<h3>Tips for figuring out where to start</h3>
<p>As organizations <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/resources/techbeacon-guide-how-roll-out-robotic-process-automation" rel="noopener noreferrer">identify use cases for RPA</a>, experts recommend that they seek out scenarios where:</p>
<p>Organizations should be wary of trying to automate activities that require a lot of human interpretation of unstructured data.</p>
<p>And even if a process is repetitive and defined, be careful that you&#8217;re not automating a fundamentally bad or obsolete process using RPA. In some cases, it may be worth the investment to re-engineer processes, develop better integrations or APIs to glue together systems, or even pay down technical debt and re-architect your underlying systems.</p>

<h3>What&#8217;s next: How RPA is evolving</h3>
<p>When RPA first arose as a category, it evolved from macros that automated simple tasks into programmable bots based on a set of human-defined process rules. </p>
<p>These bots helped improve efficiency in isolated situations, but organizations soon struggled on two fronts. First, discovering and defining processes for the bots to automate—at scale—has been <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-train-your-bots-5-rpa-fails-avoid" rel="noopener noreferrer">a challenge for RPA</a> from the start. Second, the management of the bots themselves and the process-defined rule-sets that direct their actions have become a big bugbear.</p>
<p>This is what has led to the growth in RPA platforms, which can help on both fronts. <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-choose-right-rpa-tool" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPA tools</a> help automate the discovery of the processes and provide tools for line-of-business users to more easily build automations based on their process needs, often based on pre-built bot libraries. Additionally, platforms define rules that govern and orchestrate the way bots run.</p>
<p>RPA vendors are trying to flex the limits of process definition by developing machine learning capabilities to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/robotic-process-automation-5-key-trends-watch" rel="noopener noreferrer">automatically discover and learn processes</a>. Increasingly, vendors are building in the ability to record and analyze user actions and then use machine learning to automatically define process rules and reduce the number of manual steps.</p>
<p>However, the heavy lifting still typically falls on business stakeholders and the automation team to get things rolling.</p>
<p>Usually, however, RPA projects <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/13-robotic-process-automation-experts-you-should-follow" rel="noopener noreferrer">require the aid of consultants and integrators</a>, which is why<a target="_blank" href="https://www.horsesforsources.com/RPA-forecast-2016-2022_120118" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> analysts project</a> a threefold increase in spending on RPA software through 2022.</p>

<p><strong>OLU?</strong> Jay Jay explains—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.teiss.co.uk/daimler-ag-mercedes-source-code-leak/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer" title="read the full text">Daimler AG left OLU source code of Mercedes vans accessible to anyone</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Onboard logic units or OLUs are the control unit of Mercedes vans, connecting them to the cloud and enabling third-party developers to create apps that retrieve data of the vehicle like the van&#8217;s internal status or for freezing vans in case of theft.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Ohhh, “the cloud,” eh?</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=16400596&amp;cid=60080832" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer" title="read the full text">Malays2 bowman</a></i> denies they’re a cammo wearing kook:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Do. Not. Want. I see a rather profitable cottage industry popping up that involves removing/bypassing this ****.</p>
<p>People laugh whenever somebody mentions &#8220;New World Order&#8221;, and they risk being labeled a cammo wearing kook who loves to play GI-Joe in the woods with a rusty AK-47. [But] there is nothing supernatural or unreal about it. It&#8217;s yet another classic power grab, but this time taken up a few notches.</p>

<p><strong>Uhhh, okay.</strong> Chris de Ramus drives the story home, co-piloted by Duncan Riley—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/05/18/mercedes-benz-source-code-exposed-via-misconfigured-git-registration-system/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer" title="read the full text">Mercedes-Benz source code exposed via misconfigured Git registration system</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>In this GitLab instance, bad actors could register an account on Daimler’s code-hosting portal and download over 580 Git repositories containing the Mercedes source code and sell that information to the company’s competitors. … Additionally, hackers could leverage the exposed passwords and API tokens of Daimler’s systems to access and steal even more of the company’s sensitive information.<br />…<br />Without a proactive approach to security, companies open themselves up to undue risk. Most organisations rely on detecting risks and misconfigurations in the cloud at runtime … instead of preventing them during the build process, which increases security and compliance risks significantly. It also interferes with productivity, as developers have to spend their time addressing the issues.<br />…<br />Organizations should ‘shift left’ by taking preventative measures early on in their … CI/CD pipelines. … Such a proactive approach will allow organizations to prevent security issues from occurring and will enable security teams to catch misconfigurations before leaks occur.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>So what are these search queries?</strong> Chris Ueland and Courtney Couch aren’t dorks—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://securitytrails.com/blog/google-hacking-techniques" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer" title="read the full text">Exploring Google Hacking Techniques</a>:</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div id=""><picture class="single-article__img"><source media="(max-width: 899px)" data-lazy-srcset="https://testguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PerformanceTestingTrends-1-575x360-c-default.png"></source></picture>
<p>Many of the trends I’m listing here took place earlier with other software development activities like functional automation testing, but only now are <strong>performance testing</strong> activities catching up.</p>
<h2>Shift from Performance Testing to Performance Engineering</h2>
<p>One of the most significant quality trends I&#8217;ve been seeing over the last few years is the move from doing performance testing only, to teams embracing a full, SDLC performance engineering practice.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none;" src="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/14504660/height/90/theme/custom/thumbnail/yes/direction/backward/render-playlist/no/custom-color/87A93A/" width="100%" height="90" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>But what <i>is</i> performance engineering?</p>
<p>Performance engineering is a cultural shift in the way organizations view their essential processes. Performance engineering embraces practices and capabilities that build quality and performance throughout an organization.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/appperfeng" rel="noopener noreferrer">Todd DeCapua</a>, author of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-performance-engineering/9781492030164/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Effective Performance Engineering</i></a>, has said that performance engineering means understanding how all the parts of the system fit together, knowing which metrics matter, and building in performance quality from the first design.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://guildconferences.com/conferences/perfguild-2020/" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-996320 noreferrer"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-996320" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=" http:="" alt="Scott Moore Performance Engineering" width="1200" height="628" data-lazy-src="https://testguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Scott_Moore_Promo.png"/><noscript><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-996320" src="https://testguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Scott_Moore_Promo.png" alt="Scott Moore Performance Engineering" width="1200" height="628"/></noscript></a></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/loadtester" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Moore</a>, a performance testing consultant, and speaker at the 2020 PerfGuild, expresses a similar belief when he says that the days of testing performance into a product are over. It&#8217;s too risky, causing too much technical debt to go back and do it later.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none;" src="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/11541953/height/90/theme/custom/thumbnail/yes/direction/backward/render-playlist/no/custom-color/87A93A/" width="100%" height="90" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>This is the same type of shift that occurred with functional automation years ago. Rather than have one person responsible for automation, everyone on the sprint team becomes responsible.</p>
<p>So how can you help your company transform into a performance engineering culture?</p>
<p>You might think the first step is technical, but I have a tremendous piece of actionable, non-technical advice you can use right now–MIP it.</p>
<p>One thing you can implement anytime, anywhere with performance or any other quality concern is to MIP it (Mention in Passing).</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/sbarber" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Barber</a> explained to me that there was a time when he would “MIP” to anyone he passed in his office, “How&#8217;s performance today?”</p>
<p>That person could be anyone, whether they were directly involved in his project or not.</p>
<p>In fact, he would MIP to anyone in the building, “How&#8217;s performance today?” And at the end of the first week, he says performance increased significantly.</p>
<p>Be sure to check out Scott Moore’s Effective Performance Engineering session at this year’s PerfGuild. It’ll be a great introduction to folks who are new to performance engineering and want to learn about some actionable ways to get started.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a start – the real push is to get your agile team thinking about performance as early as possible, not after the fact.</p>
<p><div class="fitvids-video"><iframe title="Top 6 Performance Testing Trends for 2020" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0XDjqVKCRt0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</p>
<h2>Shift Left Performance</h2>
<p>Similar to trying to get developers more involved in functional automation by using the same languages and tools that they use in their day-to-day work flow, you can do the same to move performance testing to an earlier place in your SDLC.</p>
<p>Because of this, there is a trend to create performance tests using developer-friendly tools and languages—this allows performance tasks to fit in with your developer&#8217;s current ecosystem.</p>
<p>For example, if you have Python developers, you can introduce a tool like Locust that allows you to create Python-based, performance-testing scripts. If you use <a target="_blank" href="https://testguild.com/open-source-performance-testing-tools/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Locust</a>, everything is in Python; everything is in code.</p>
<p>You can even use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PyCharm</a> as an IDE.</p>
<p>Another popular technology option is <a target="_blank" href="https://testguild.com/javascript-performance-testing-k6/" rel="noopener noreferrer">k6</a>, which focuses on giving your developers the best experience for load testing. K6 takes a code-like approach to developing load test scripts.</p>
<p>These dev friendly tools in the market allow you to treat your performance testing scenarios or test cases like you would any other application code. This, in turn, enables you to shift your automated performance testing efforts to earlier in the software development lifecycles.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Thecapnews" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cristian Daniel Marquez Barrios</a>, a front-end developer with over ten years of experience, gave me an excellent recommendation to get developers involved in creating more performant software.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none;" src="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/13301312/height/90/theme/custom/thumbnail/yes/direction/backward/render-playlist/no/custom-color/87A93A/" width="100%" height="90" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>He said that all front-end developers should be using, at a minimum, <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Lighthouse</a> metrics that are available in Google Chrome tools.</p>
<p>When you open <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools" rel="noopener noreferrer">DevTools in Chrome</a> and navigate to the Audits tab, you can find the Lighthouse audit. This will tell what&#8217;s the performance of your site simulating mobile on the desktop version of a browser. So it&#8217;s also a perfect tool to start with.</p>
<p>A pillar of performance engineering is that performance needs to be baked into your software from the beginning, with developers creating performant code in your product from the start.</p>
<p>Check out Alyson Henry &amp; Matthew Andrus’ <a target="_blank" href="https://guildconferences.com/conferences/perfguild-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PerfGuild session</a>, Why Good Test Scripts aren&#8217;t Enough–Shifting Left and Automation as Keys to the Future of Testing for a great example on how to achieve this.</p>
<p>This trend can help get your whole team involved in focusing on creating performance software from the beginning.</p>
<p>Another approach is to leverage your teams existing functional selenium test to create browser-level performance tests and performance engineering activities.</p>

<h2>Browser-Based Performance Testing</h2>
<p>You might be wondering why they shouldn&#8217;t just use a non-UI-based protocol.</p>
<p>Modern JavaScript front-end frameworks like Angular and React make it very difficult to create a performance script at a protocol level, which is kind of the traditional way testers have been developing performance tests since the mid-nineties.</p>
<p>In such cases, there is no interaction between the UI and the server like you&#8217;d find in a typical, older, client-server application architecture.</p>
<p>With protocol tools, you would have to do additional scripting and programming to capture those kinds of transactions.</p>
<p>So, the process of setting up a script becomes increasingly tricky.</p>
<p>By focusing on browser-based performance script creation, you&#8217;re spending less time doing any of the other manual editing, correlation, and programming that would otherwise be necessary with a protocol-based recording tool.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because this approach uses a real browser and more people are familiar with interacting with the actual browser rather than a protocol, this helps to shift-left the performance activity that more teams probably should get involved in.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/n_vanderhoeven" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole van der Hoeven</a>’s <a target="_blank" href="https://guildconferences.com/conferences/perfguild-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PerfGuild talk</a> will be about how to combine both browser and protocol-level performance scripting to create a cool hybrid load testing solution. (Don’t miss it!)</p>
<p>Does it replace protocol-level performance testing? No.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s another tool you can add to your performance toolbox to help transform your team toward performance engineering.</p>

<h2>Shift-Right AI Performance Engineering</h2>
<p>I first heard this term (AIOPS) from <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Jonathon_Wright" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathon Wright</a>. AiOps is about expanding artificial intelligence (AI) out of functional testing and applying it to all software development shift-right activities including performance testing.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none;" src="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/12825377/height/90/theme/custom/thumbnail/yes/direction/backward/render-playlist/no/custom-color/87A93A/" width="100%" height="90" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Although many companies have started to make the shift-right they still tend to focus on simple analytics.</p>
<p>Jonathon believes that digital experience analytics are incredibly important, but that we need to stop focusing on a web page or a mobile app. We need to start thinking about the entire customer journey.</p>
<p>Jonathon will present a real-world scenario using all open-source tools for his Shift-Right Digital Experience Analytics talk at the 2020 PerfGuild.</p>
<p>For example, it&#8217;s monitoring things in production.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s then able to take that monitoring information and automatically create a performance test model for what&#8217;s actually happened in production.</p>
<p>It can then use the model to auto-generate your performance tests and make use of all the information produced in your SDLC pipeline from beginning to end.</p>
<p>It can also help inform your decisions using machine learning to bring up key insights that you might not have noticed in your pipeline.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/perfpulley" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Pulley</a> also believes there are excellent uses for AI and machine learning intelligence in performance testing.</p>
<p>If you look at what we do inside performance testing and performance engineering in general, it is pattern-based. And the conventional AI used today is less expert-system-based and more AI-based.</p>
<p>This type of AI doesn&#8217;t ask questions and assigns weights.</p>
<p>Instead, it behaves more like it’s looking at a pattern and observing match conditions. Is it a normal condition or an exception? And if it&#8217;s an exception, does it match other exception patterns?</p>
<p>When you’re talking about resource utilization and things of that nature, AI can be very useful.</p>
<p>AI is also great for looking at the behavior of systems going through the logs and saying, “Hey, here&#8217;s what 90 percent of our people are doing.”</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how our users normal navigate our site</p>
<p>Here are the most common user workflows and building a model for what that should look like.</p>
<p>AI can then generating the performance scripts for you based on how your real users actually behave in production. It can also help create test data to use.</p>
<p>This helps to create more realistic performance scenarios and a transaction mix for your tests.</p>
<p>Monitoring things in production is great, but how to plan for unknowns that tend to happen once your system is live?</p>

<h2>Chaos Engineering/Resilience Testing</h2>
<p>If the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us anything, it’s that we need to make sure our software is more resilient.</p>
<p>We have seen scenarios in production that most teams probably hadn’t anticipated. But how to plan for unknown behavior?</p>
<p>Examples of companies that learned this the hard way include<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/business/robinhood-outage-explanation/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"> RobinHood</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/business/sba-loan-system-crash.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">SBA</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52671266" rel="noopener noreferrer">Epic Game</a> Company—all whose systems went down due to unexpected spikes.</p>
<p>The best approach to achieving chaos is to test how the system responds under stress proactively.</p>
<p>You can then identify and fix failures before they impact your customers or cause damage to your reputation due to the poor publicity an outage could receive.</p>
<p>The idea of chaos engineering is that it compares what you <i>believe </i>will happen in your distributed system against the reality of what actually happens.</p>
<p>To learn how to build resilient business software systems, you can use a chaos test tool to break things in your environment on purpose to see if it actually fails the way you believed it would.</p>
<p>Chaos engineering is a growing area and it&#8217;s achieved by using thoughtful, well-planned experiments that help to reveal weaknesses in your systems.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/tammybutow" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tammy Butow</a> Principal Site Reliability Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gremlin.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gremlin</a> suggested we think of Chaos Engineering as being like preventative medicine in that it’s a disciplined approach to identifying failures before they become outages.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none;" src="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/12516998/height/90/theme/custom/thumbnail/yes/direction/backward/render-playlist/no/custom-color/87A93A/" width="100%" height="90" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Another similar type of testing to help is robustness testing.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.perftestplus.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dawn Haynes</a> CEO &amp; Testing Yogini at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.perftestplus.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PerfTestPlus</a> has been a big advocate of adding more robustness testing into our test plans.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none;" src="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/11997335/height/90/theme/custom/thumbnail/yes/direction/backward/render-playlist/no/custom-color/87A93A/" width="100%" height="90" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The industry glossary definition of robustness is the way software responds in the face of invalid inputs or unexpected or stressful environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Dawn likes to define it as applications delivering value to customers consistently and not disappointing them or frustrating them in any particular way.</p>
<p>So what would be a requirement for robustness? Maybe we just look at how our apps handle invalid inputs, or how we handle stressful environmental conditions.</p>
<p>But if we were to expand it and say it’s about the user experience, how robust are we for user interaction?</p>
<p>Do we fall down when we get surprised by something, or do we handle surprises in a way that can do two things:</p>
<p>Inform the user about what&#8217;s going on right now, and make some sort of suggestion to them about what to do next.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re surprised by something, can we do anything other than fail? Or can we expect that throughout the run of a piece of software we will be surprised by something?</p>
<p>And if a user is surprised by something not expected, what should we do about it next? What are the options in the face of surprises?</p>
<p>I expect variance, chaos and resilience testing to be significant growth areas of focus for teams in 2020 and beyond due to the COVID-19 scare.</p>
<p>That’s why I’m excited to be offering two sessions about how distortion (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/tds_at" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul McLean</a>) and variance (James Pulley) can help you to create more realistic load tests that will help plan for unknowns.</p>
<h2>Performance in CI/CD</h2>
<p>So, where does that performance fit into a DevOps pipeline?</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/prossaro" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paola Rossaro</a> Co-Founder and CTO at Nouvola believes there is a trend underway for performance tests to become part of your acceptance tests.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none;" src="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/13203521/height/90/theme/custom/thumbnail/yes/direction/backward/render-playlist/no/custom-color/87A93A/" width="100%" height="90" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Automation is vital, and having a reliable reproduction of the production environment is a must, so rapid feedback also allows resolving issues before they reach the user.</p>
<p>This is what we call continuous testing.</p>
<p>Continuous testing is really a key component of continuous integration and continuous delivery and creating testing at speed.</p>
<p>What good is having a streamlined, continuous delivery process if the only way to find out if the performance of your product is not working well is via a help ticket being open by a user?</p>
<p>Testing and continuous integration actually go hand in hand; each step in the continuous delivery process has testing associated with it.</p>
<p>So from the development environment, the integration, testing and test environment, functional testing, and then a pre-production environment with performance and acceptance testing up to production, you then have synthetic monitoring, real-user monitoring, and general monitoring to make sure the performance is working well.</p>
<p>In all those steps, we can see continuous delivery and continuous testing with performance testing really do work together.</p>
<p>Look for more teams to start integrating performance into their CI/CD pipeline in 2020 and beyond.</p>

<p>How much is it worth to catch more bugs early in your product release process? Depending on where you are in your release process, you might be writing unit or systems tests. But, you need to run end-to-end tests to prove behavior, and quality engineers require a high degree of skill to write end-to-end tests successfully.</p>



					</div>
					
<!-- /wp:more -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What would you say if a single validation engine could help you ensure data integrity, functional integrity, and graphical integrity in your web and mobile applications? And, as a result, catch more bugs earlier in your release process?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Catch Bugs or Die</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s start with the dirty truth: all software has bugs. Your desire to create bug-free code conflicts with the reality that you often lack the tools to uncover all the bugs until someone finds them way late in the product delivery process. Like, say, the customer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>With all the potential failure modes you design for – and then test against – you begin to realize that not all failure modes are created equal. You might even have your own triage list:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Security &amp; penetration</li><li>Data integrity and consistency</li><li>Functional integrity and consistency</li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So, where does graphical integrity and consistency fit on your list? For many of your peers, graphical integrity might not even show up on their list. They might consider graphical integrity as managing cosmetic issues. Not a big deal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lots of us don’t have reliable tools to validate graphical integrity. We rely on our initial unit tests, systems tests, and end-to-end tests to uncover graphical issues – and we think that they’re solved once they’re caught. Realistically, though, any application evolution process introduces changes that can introduce bugs – including graphical bugs. But, who has an automation system to do visual validation with a high degree of accuracy?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Tradeoffs In End-to-End Testing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your web and mobile apps behave at several levels. The level that matters to your users, though, happens at the user interface on the browser or the device. Your server code, database code, and UI code turns into this representation of visual elements with some kind of visual cursor that moves across a plane (or keyboard equivalent) to settle on different elements. The end-to-end test exercises all the levels of your code, and you can use it to validate the integrity of your code.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JPfwRaN6oZapcOYgO8nHFqUsNTg8Dws7qfW4SY-Dp3HdGTUQPVEGxYtPg1H0ZUmCeUuekryggv_4flUJKByHFoOAYAIw8qXHSlrXLZpT1Uz9uc5N_vgdQEb4_HQZR7SczpTMIaj9" alt="code 2434271 1280"/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So, why don’t people think to run more of these end-to-end tests? You know the answers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, end-to-end tests run more slowly. Page rendering takes time – your test code needs to manipulate the browser or your mobile app, execute an HTTP request, receive an HTTP response, and render the received HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even if you run tests in parallel, they’re slower than unit or system tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, it takes a lot of effort to write good end-to-end tests. Your tests must exercise the application properly. You develop data and logic pre-conditions for each test so it can be run independently of others. And, you build test automation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Third, you need two kinds of automation. You need a controller that allows you to control your app by entering data and clicking buttons in the user interface. And, most importantly, you need a validation engine that can capture your output conditions and match those with the ones a user would expect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can choose among many controllers for browsers or mobile devices. Still, why do your peers still write code that effectively spot-checks the DOM? Why not use a visual validation engine that can catch more bugs?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Visual AI For Code Integrity</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You have peers who continue to rely on coded assertions to spot-check the DOM. Then you have the 288 of your peers who did something different: they participated in the Applitools Visual AI Rockstar Hackathon. And they got to experience first-hand the value of Visual AI for building and maintaining end-to-end tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I wrote previously, we gave participants five different test cases, asked them to write conventional tests for those cases, and then to write test cases using Applitools Visual AI. For each submission, we checked the conditions each test writer covered, as well as the failing output behaviors each test-writer caught.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a refresher, we chose five cases that one might encounter in any application:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Comparing two web pages</li><li>Data-driven verification of a function</li><li>Sorting a table</li><li>Testing a bar chart</li><li>Handling dynamic web content</li></ol><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For these test cases, we discovered that the typical engineer writing conventional tests to spot-check the DOM spent the bulk of their time writing assertion code. Unfortunately, the typical spot-check assertions missed failure modes. The typical submission got about 65% coverage. Alternatively, the engineers who wrote the tests that provided the highest coverage spent about 50% more time writing tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, when using Visual AI for visual validation, two good things happened. First, everyone spent way less time writing test code. The typical engineer went from 7 hours of coding tests and assertions to about 1.2 hours of coding tests and Visual AI. Second, the average test coverage jumped from 65% to 95%. So, simultaneously, engineers took less time and got more coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Visual AI Helps You Catch More Bugs</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you find more bugs, more quickly, with less effort, that’s significant to your quality engineering efforts. You’re able to validate data, functional, and graphical by focusing on the end-to-end test cases you run. You spend less time thinking about and maintaining all the assertion code checking the result of each test case.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using Visual AI makes you more effective? How much more effective? Based on the data we reviewed – you catch 45% of your bugs earlier in your release process (and, importantly, before they reach customers).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Now more than ever, consumers and businesses alike are relying on digital experiences to deliver critical services, maintain normalcy, and provide comfort in uncertain times. From food delivery to video conferencing, streaming services to online banking, the shift to digital-first solutions has been accelerated. And with that shift, it is clear that digital confidence is poised to take the spotlight as a key enabler for organizations that want to grow their business.</p>
<p>Digital confidence is the idea that everyone in your organization, from leadership all the way down to the developers writing the code, expects that the applications they create function, look, and perform exactly as intended. Organizations that can create a culture and processes that are committed to this idea see a number of positive effects, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improved productivity &#8211; with digital confidence, engineering teams are empowered to continually innovate and build features that customers want. They can then introduce those changes quickly without fear of breaking anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better user experience &#8211; digital confidence has the power to permeate your entire business, and that trickles down to your users. Customers who have a great experience with your application are more likely to return, creating reliable repeat business. This leads to the third benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased revenue &#8211; digitally confident organizations enjoy loyal customer bases, but those that take it one step further are able to create those customers across every channel. Ensuring your application covers web and mobile platforms (every browser, operating system and device combination) gives organizations the ability to reach more markets, and capture more revenue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This idea isn’t just a theory. There are digital organizations today that are experiencing the above benefits, and more, as they implement practices that build digital confidence.</p>
<h3><b>Quick Base Removes Testing Bottlenecks to Accelerate Release Velocity</b></h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.quickbase.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quick Base</a> provides a low-code application development platform that allows non-technical developers to create secure cloud applications without compromising IT governance and control. As they adapted their development pipeline to accelerate releases, they realized that testing was a major bottleneck. With a UI regression suite that would take upwards of five hours to complete, they were prevented from creating the fast feedback loops the team needed to deliver more features and capabilities to customers quickly.</p>
<p>By automating a large subset of tests in Selenium and WebDriver, and using Sauce Labs to run those tests at scale, Quick Base is now running that same UI regression in 15 minutes. This means that they can run these tests not just at the end of the development cycle, but every time a developer checks in code. “We find issues early in the pipeline because we can run tests in parallel,” explains Ken LaBak, a Senior Software Engineer in Test at Quick Base, “The teams get feedback much more quickly, and we can address issues before they ever get into our production environment.”</p>
<p>This type of fast feedback creates confidence across the entire organization, as they are empowered to deliver features at speed, knowing that there are quality checks built in to ensure the user experience is flawless. Creating this level of digital confidence has helped Quick Base not just in their everyday business, but has also helped them lead the way in the era of COVID-19. To learn more about how Quick Base’s digital confidence has helped in times of need, check out this SauceCon Online talk from Karen Motyka, Director of QA at  Quick Base, “Fighting a Pandemic with Software Quality.“</p>
<h3><b>LogMeIn Improves Productivity to Build Confidence in Quality</b></h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.logmein.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">LogMeIn</a> is a leading provider of cloud-based connectivity solutions. In this highly competitive space, their teams understand the importance of speed when bringing new and innovative features to market. They also knew that the mobile market presented opportunities to win more market share. They knew that in order to be confident in the features they were delivering, increasing test coverage was going to be a key factor.</p>
<p>Using test automation at scale in conjunction with the Sauce Labs Real Device Cloud, LogMeIn was able to provide the platform their teams needed to continuously test throughout the development lifecycle. “We have higher confidence in our software by using Sauce Labs,” says Parameshwaran Murli, Architect at LogMeIn. “Overall, our development teams feel stronger about the test results they’re getting using these two solutions.” This sense of confidence in test results means that developers are empowered to deploy more frequently, knowing that their features work exactly as intended. This allows LogMeIn to penetrate new mobile markets, and create more loyal users of their platforms.</p>
<h3><b>N26 Creates Creates Flawless Experiences in Their Mobile Banking Application</b></h3>
<p>Founded in Berlin in 2013, the mobile bank <a target="_blank" href="https://n26.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">N26</a> has redesigned banking for the smartphone, making it easy, fast, transparent and contemporary. An early player in the mobile-first banking space, they had a unique opportunity to capture new users to gain market share in a competitive industry. And they knew that manual testing was going to prevent them from reaching their goals. </p>
<p>Coupled with an initiative to automate their tests using Appium, the team at N26 relied on the Sauce Labs Real Device Cloud to provide access to the devices that they needed to ensure the best experience for all of their users. But while some teams think of testing benefits in terms of infrastructure cost or time savings, N26 understands the larger picture of creating digital confidence. According to Martyna Wojna, Quality Assurance Engineer at N26, “The main benefits to our business are continuous releases and happier customers.” Improved productivity gives teams the confidence that they are delivering the best experiences to their customers, and customers inherit that confidence. That has a long lasting effect on the health of the business, as N26 continues to build a growing base of loyal users.</p>
<h3><b>Building Digital Confidence for Your Team</b></h3>
<p>After reading these real world stories you might be ready to start building digital confidence for your organization. But many might wonder where exactly they can start. The road to digital confidence is long, and it takes buy-in from every level of the organization. Those teams that are successful in their journeys are the ones that are able to tie testing directly back to key business drivers, such as productivity, user experience, or revenue. If you can make those connections, and show how an improved quality strategy can accelerate gains in these categories, then you are well on your way.</p>
<p>Sauce Labs offers a number of resources to help you build a case for digital confidence. <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/digital-confidence?utm_source=organic&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=content%20&amp;utm_term=" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visit our website</a>, where we have research demonstrating the value of better customer experiences, reports on the ROI of continuous testing, and more stories like the ones above. Using resources like these as your guide, you’ll be on the path to digital confidence in no time.</p>
