            </div>
<h2>ShinyHunters Exposes Over 125 Million Online Credentials</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Meet <a target="_blank" href="https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2021/01/25/shinyhunters-wave-3-one-hacker-exposes-over-125-million-credentials/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShinyHunters</a>, a hacker who recently leaked 10 new databases this past month from companies including:</p>
<p>• Pixlr.com<br />• Bonobos.com<br />• Wognai.com<br />• Tesspring.com<br />• Tunedglobal.com<br />• Buyucoin.com<br />• Wappalyzer.com<br />• Chqbook.com<br />• Rooter.io<br />• MeetMindful.com</p>
<p>But this isn’t the first time they’ve made headlines. It all started in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/story/shinyhunters-hacking-group-data-breach-spree/" rel="noopener noreferrer">May of 2020</a> when ShinyHunters attempted to sell several stolen databases on the Dark Web. They also leaked several other databases between <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/07/29/hacker-gives-away-386-million-stolen-records-on-dark-web-what-you-need-to-do-now-shinyhunters-data-breach/?sh=19cca2db6f39" rel="noopener noreferrer">April and July</a>.  In October, they proceeded to leak the database of the meal kit delivery company, HomeChef. Not one to be easily satisfied, <a target="_blank" href="https://latesthackingnews.com/2020/11/16/shinyhunters-target-numerous-firms-in-a-recent-wave-of-data-breaches/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShinyHunters continued their antics</a> by exposing sixteen other databases in November, where personal user records and information were publicly shared. Prominent companies who fell victim to this wave of data breaches include gaming site Animal Jam, online marketplace Minted, and coupon company ShopBack, among others.</p>
<p>Personal data released ranges from contact information and addresses, dates of birth, passwords, and financial information. Not including the latest data breach, a total of 129,406,564 user records were exposed. Given the alarming size of the exposure, this gives way to rising concerns for when ShinyHunters will strike again. What’s more, this group seeks notoriety from their misdeeds, hoping to claim credibility for the number of attacks they can execute—a troubling thought for everyday users like you and me.</p>
<p>You never know when or if a breach will occur, which is why we must take precautions to protect our data in the case of a security breach. In the past year alone, we have seen a record number of data breaches, posing unforeseen security concerns and bringing light to new priorities for data protection. That’s why we must learn from these occurrences by proactively protecting our private information in 2021 and beyond.</p>
<h3><strong>Tips </strong> <strong>for Protecting Yourself After a Data Breach</strong></h3>
<p>There’s no way of knowing whether your personal information will fall into the wrong hands or that it will be used maliciously, but ShinyHunters has indicated that they are on the lookout for opportunities to expose more databases, so we must take the necessary steps to protect our personal information before the damage is done.</p>
<h4> 1. Find out what information was stolen</h4>
<p>Not knowing what data was stolen can make it significantly more difficult to pinpoint what threats you may become subject to. If you realize a company you buy from fell victim to a data breach, start investigating. Use <a target="_blank" href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">this tool</a> to see if the breach affects you.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Update your credentials </strong></h4>
<p>Great passwords are usually the first line of defense against personal data exposures, so it’s important to update them as soon as they are compromised. Additionally, use different passwords or passphrases for each of your online accounts which helps protect the majority of your data if one of your accounts becomes vulnerable. One route you can take is to use a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">password manager</a> that not only lets you create strong passwords but can let you manage them efficiently with added security and peace of mind.</p>
<p>On top of updating your credentials, you’ll want to secure your log-in process by enabling 2-Factor Authentication. So, if a hacker has access to your stolen passwords, they’ll still have to bypass an added security layer that is time sensitive. This makes it even more difficult for them to access your information.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Be on the lookout for spear-phishing attacks</strong></h4>
<p>Like regular phishing attempts, spear-phishing attempts will try to steal your information by posing as an authentic entity to target unsuspecting victims. However, spear phishing attempts can be harder to spot because the attempt is modified to target a specific individual, often in the form of a personalized email. If you receive an email, call, or text asking you to download software, app, or pay a certain amount of money, do not click or take any direct action from the message. Instead, go straight to the organization’s website. This will prevent you from downloading malicious content from phishing links or forking over money unnecessarily.</p>
<h4><strong>4. Keep an eye out for suspicious activity on your accounts </strong></h4>
<p>If you find that your credit card information has been exposed, keep an eye on your bank records and validate each transaction. In the above cases for a site like MeetMindful, where Facebook authentication tokens and user IDs were stolen, it’s always best to keep an eye on other social accounts for fraudulent activity.</p>
<h4><strong> 5. Freeze your credit</strong></h4>
<p>For maximum financial protection, freeze your credit to prevent hackers from opening new accounts in your name. Placing a freeze on your credit is free for consumers and won’t affect your credit score. Simply contact the three major credit bureaus—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—to set up a freeze to secure your credit file until you decide to lift it.</p>

<p><strong>North Korean state-sponsored hackers</strong> are targeting and attacking white-hat security researchers. They’re using a combination of zero-day exploits, Trojan-laced VS project bundles, and good old social engineering.</p>
<p><strong>So says Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG),</strong> which has been looking into the perps. It’s blaming APT38 (a.k.a. Lazarus Group, DarkSeoul, ZINC, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>And there are lessons for all of us.</strong> In this week’s <i><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/contributors/richi-jennings" rel="noopener">Security Blogwatch</a></i>, let’s be careful out there.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>A North Korean government hacking group has targeted members of the cyber-security community engaging in vulnerability research. … The attacks have been spotted by … TAG, a Google security team specialized in hunting advanced persistent threat (APT) groups.<br />…<br />[It’s been] linked to the Lazarus Group, a well-known North Korean state-sponsored operation. … Some security researchers believe the North Korean group most likely used a combination of Chrome and Windows 10 zero-day vulnerabilities to deploy their malicious code.<br />…<br />The reason for targeting security researchers? … To steal exploits for vulnerabilities discovered by the infected researchers, vulnerabilities that the threat group could deploy in its own attacks with little to no development costs.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>And</strong> Jon Porter carries the story—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250060/google-threat-analysis-group-north-korean-hackers-cybersecurity-researchers-social-engineering" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Google warns of ‘novel social engineering method’</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Government-backed hackers based in North Korea are targeting individual security researchers through a number of means. [It] worryingly appears to exploit unpatched Windows 10 and Chrome vulnerabilities.<br />…<br />[TAG] cites several cases of researchers’ machines having been infected simply by visiting the hackers’ blog, even when running the latest versions of Windows 10 and Chrome. … The attackers used a range of different platforms — including Telegram, LinkedIn and Discord.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Let’s go to the horse’s mouth.</strong> Google TAG’s Adam Weidemann hits the panic button—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/new-campaign-targeting-security-researchers/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">New campaign targeting security researchers</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>The actors behind this campaign, which we attribute to a government-backed entity based in North Korea, have employed a number of means to target researchers. … We hope this post will remind those in the security research community that they are targets to government-backed attackers and should remain vigilant.<br />…<br />The actors have been observed targeting specific security researchers by a novel social engineering method. After establishing initial communications, the actors would ask the targeted researcher if they wanted to collaborate on vulnerability research [via] a Visual Studio Project. Within the Visual Studio Project would be [a] DLL that would be executed through Visual Studio Build Events. The DLL is custom malware that would immediately begin communicating with actor-controlled C2.<br />…<br />We have also observed several cases where researchers have been compromised after visiting the actors’ blog. … Shortly thereafter, a malicious service was installed on the researcher’s system and an in-memory backdoor would begin beaconing. … We’re unable to confirm the mechanism of compromise.<br />…<br />We recommend that you compartmentalize your research activities using separate physical or virtual machines for general web browsing, interacting with others in the research community, accepting files from third parties, and your own security research.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>So who got hacked?</strong> Gareth Corfield relates Alejandro Caceres’ story—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/01/26/north_korea_targeted_me_0_day/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">I was targeted by North Korean 0-day hackers</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;When I read the Google thing I honestly think I said out loud, &#8216;Holy ****,&#8217; I thought it was insane. Attacked by a nation state? Me!?&#8221;<br />…<br />A vulnerability broker he had known for a while and trusted had introduced him to a new researcher called James Willy &#8220;from New York,&#8221; Caceres [said]. &#8220;We hopped in a group chat, the three of us, and he sent me a Visual Studio project to take a look at a driver bug that caused a blue screen of death.&#8221;<br />…<br />&#8220;James&#8221; [said] it was linked to Google Chrome – an instant attention-grabber for bug hunters. Vulns affecting software used by tens of millions worldwide are rare and command hefty rewards. … &#8220;The code was all legit, it was a real crash with potential security implications, but I wasn&#8217;t careful when I opened the Visual Studio project.&#8221; [But] opening some Visual Studio projects can cause code to execute, which was the North Koreans&#8217; attack vector.<br />…<br />Sometimes – just sometimes – those evil nation state hackers really are coming after you. Being an ordinary bughunting pro doesn&#8217;t make you less of a target.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>But</strong> this <i><a target="_blank" href="https://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=18123256&amp;cid=60994104" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Anonymous Coward</a></i> is distinctly unimpressed:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>A whitehat that runs Windows 10, Chrome and Visual Studio outside of a sandbox doesn&#8217;t deserve to be called a hacker.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>A unique exploit?</strong> Nope: Seongsu Park—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/unpacker/status/1354203847455956995" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">@unpacker</a></i>—has déjà vu:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We have seen that Lazarus group use this malware cluster, we named ThreatNeedle, in recent attack against the defense industry. It’s almost identical malware with the same RC4 key and the overlapped infrastructure. Surprised that it&#8217;s a researcher target at this time.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Wait. <em>Pause.</em></strong> How do we know it was the DPRK, anyway? <i><a target="_blank" href="https://forums.theregister.com/forum/all/2021/01/26/north_korea_targeted_me_0_day/#c_4193852" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">martinusher</a></i> ain’t convinced:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I think there&#8217;s some kind of dice or spinner that they use that&#8217;s marked &#8220;Russia, China, Iran, Cuba, North Korea&#8221; and so on that news services use to identify the &#8216;nation state&#8217; responsible for the hack du jour.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not ruling out nation states, just that there are a lot more criminals out there than there are nation states. There&#8217;s also good money to be made from vulnerabilities so I&#8217;d expect that less than ethical people would have moved in to what is a decent business opportunity.</p>
<p></em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Indeed.</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250060/google-threat-analysis-group-north-korean-hackers-cybersecurity-researchers-social-engineering#535821185" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">scooby359</a></i> would have gotten away with it, if it wasn’t for you pesky kids: <em>[You’re fired—Ed.]</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>I’m always curious how such a seemingly backwards country can have such advanced cyber security skills.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Yeah, right.</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=18123256&amp;cid=60994056" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Brian Bixby</a></i> agrees:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I&#8217;m still surprised that the &#8220;North Korean Super-Hacker&#8221; foolishness is still a thing. They have a single … fiber line that goes through the Great Firewall of China (until a few years ago it was a paired T-3 to Taiwan that frequently was congested by Kim&#8217;s porn habit.)</p>
<p>IIRC there&#8217;s one small data center in the entire country with obsolete cast-off Chinese servers. … They don&#8217;t have the capability to hire any decent instructors for their tiny educated class to teach them hacking.</p>
<p>And yet we&#8217;re supposed to tremble in our boots that the North Korean Super-Hackers are coming to get us. Seems far more likely some criminals in China or Hong Kong are spoofing NK addresses.</p>
<p></em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Meanwhile,</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/01/north-korea-hackers-use-social-media-to-target-security-researchers/?comments=1&amp;post=39609232#comment-39609232" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">QuantifiableQuoll</a></i> has this warning for us all:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The blog was also linked to on various security subreddits. If you’re the type of person who frequents those subreddits, you will want to check your computer over.</em></p></blockquote>
<h3>The moral of the story?</h3>
<p>Social engineering isn’t only for normies. Whether you’re an IT puke, an agile Dev(Sec)Ops sprinter, or a 1337 haxor: <em>Question everything</em>.</p>

<h2><strong>10 Easy Ways to Build Up Your Family’s Online Security </strong></h2>
<p>The events of 2020 didn’t just set significant lifestyle changes in motion. According to a recent study, it also influenced our mindset about our online security.</p>
<p>McAfee’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/consumer-threat-notices/new-year-new-digital-you-consumer-security-findings-from-mcafees-latest-report/?hilite=%272021%27%2C%27Consumer%27%2C%27Security%27%2C%27Mindset%27%2C%27Report%27" rel="noopener"><em>2021 Consumer Security Mindset Report</em></a> highlights our collective shift to a Digital-First mindset and the increased risks that come with it.</p>
<p>This study is essential to families for several reasons. First, because it gives us a snapshot of reality, and when we understand reality, we can take steps to improve it. Second, it’s a reminder to us as parents that helping our kids build their digital skills is a process subject to cultural shifts that will require continuous recalibration.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Reality</strong></h3>
<p>In short, the study reveals that we’re online more and, for convenience’s sake, we’re taking more chances with our security. In step with this increase in digital activity, online scams are on the rise. And, while most of us admit to being worried about our online security and, many still don’t have the digital habits they need to protect themselves.</p>
<p>How do we respond to this new and seemingly ongoing reality? We can say we need better cyber safety skills, or we can implement them.</p>
<p>To help you do just that, here are ten easy peasy steps your family can take today to strengthen the protective circle around your digital life. Note: You don’t have to be tech savvy to do these things. They are easy, effective ways to build up your family’s digital defenses. Here we go!</p>
<h3><strong>10 Ways to Boost Digital Security</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stay on top of scams.</strong> Phishing scams are at an all-time high. Discuss the precautions with kids — don’t open strange emails, click random downloads, connect with strangers online, or purchase from sketchy sources or websites.</li>
<li><strong>Zip it online.</strong> Oversharing personal information online is low-hanging fruit for hackers. They can piece together details in surprising ways to steal your identity — or worse. Encourage kids to keep private information and keep real names, city, address, school name, extracurricular activities, and pet names under wraps online.</li>
<li><strong>Create a family challenge.</strong> Find and fix your family’s security gaps. Inventory your technology, including IoT devices, smartphones, game systems, tablets, and toys. Rank device security 1-10 based on security best practices (see #8). Create an official 30-Day Family Security Challenge. Make it fun. Sit and change passwords together, review privacy settings, reduce friend lists. Come up with a reward system that tallies and recognizes each positive security step.</li>
<li><strong>Layer up your protection.</strong> Use multi-factor authentication to double-check digital users’ authenticity and add a layer of security to protect personal data and information.</li>
<li><strong>Connect with caution.</strong> If you must conduct transactions on a public Wi-Fi connection, use a virtual private network (VPN) like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn/mcafee-safe-connect.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee® Safe Connect</a> to help keep you safe while you’re online.</li>
<li><strong>Follow safe browsing habits.</strong> Browse with added security using a tool like <a target="_blank" href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com%2Fen-us%2Fsafe-browser%2Fmcafee-webadvisor.html&amp;esheet=52327479&amp;newsitemid=20201116005169&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=McAfee+WebAdvisor&amp;index=4&amp;md5=8668579d23bb59fdc7922b40838909e8" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee WebAdvisor</a> to block malware and phishing sites if you click on a malicious link. In addition to checking web sites, put your browser in private or incognito mode to reduce some tracking and auto-filling.</li>
<li><strong>Lock up your identity.</strong>  Protect your identity and important personal information using <a target="_blank" href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com%2Fconsumer%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosite%2Fidentity-protection%2Foverview.html%3Fculture%3DEN-US%26cid%3D210317%26pir%3D1&amp;esheet=52327479&amp;newsitemid=20201116005169&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=McAfee+Identity+Theft+Protection&amp;index=5&amp;md5=f65807f6a1b2c615b42b20557072b316" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee Identity Theft Protection</a>, which also helps you recover your information if your identity is compromised.</li>
<li><strong>Take control of your digital footprint.</strong> Limit information online by <strong>a)</strong> setting social media profiles to private <strong>b)</strong> regularly editing friends lists, <strong>c)</strong> deleting personal information on social profiles, <strong>d) </strong>limiting app permissions someone and browser extensions</li>
<li><strong>Purge old, unused apps and data</strong>. To strengthen security, regularly delete old data, photos, apps, emails, and unused accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Update devices asap</strong>. Those updates you’re putting off? They may be annoying but most of them are security-related, so it’s wise to install them as they come out.</li>
</ol>

<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>A couple of days ago, I have been asked whether, notably thanks to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/gdpr.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">GDPR</a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" rel="noopener">[1]</a> and the CCPA<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" rel="noopener">[2]</a>, we were seeing as professionals, a standardization in negotiations governing privacy terms.</p>
<p>Alas, we have possibly never been so much away of such harmonization. 128 out of 194 countries have put in place legislation to secure the protection of data and privacy. And despite the existence of initiatives to develop tools able to harmonize compliance with legal, security and regulatory requirements, privacy is still much of a grey zone.</p>
<p>From the EU’s standpoint, and regardless of the fact that the GDPR is seen as one of the most, if not <em>the</em> most sophisticated regulation in terms of protection of personal data, Mr. Schrems and the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) are both playing a bit with the nerves of thousands of privacy professionals.</p>
<p>For those who do not know Mr. Schrems, Maximilian is an Austrian privacy activist. As a privacy law student in 2011 at the Santa Clara University, he met a Facebook representative who explained to the students that Europeans had many privacy rights in the EU but were however not doing much to protect them. The words didn’t fall on deaf ears and by 2015, Max had brought a case against Facebook, and achieved to get the Safe Harbor (the then used as a mechanism to transfer personal data to the United States) invalidated<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" rel="noopener">[3]</a>. The Safe Harbor was replaced by the Privacy Shield, which – together with European Standard Clauses (“SCCs”) – were suspected of not being able to sufficiently protect European rights against US massive surveillance.</p>
<p>As you may have heard, on 16 July 2020<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" rel="noopener">[4]</a>, the Privacy Shield has been invalidated. The SCCs are still valid, but not sufficient <em>per se</em>. Following the Schrems II Decision, the European Commission issued some 22 pages of recommendations for the transfer of personal data outside the European Union<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" rel="noopener">[5]</a> and the set of happy few countries considered as providing adequate protection, as well as a new draft set of SCCs<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" rel="noopener">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>So, what’s next for us? Below are a couple of answers to help you out navigating through 2021.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>1. How much time do companies have to comply with the requirements of the Schrems II decision?</strong></h2>
<p>No grace period was provided by the ECJ: the consequences are applicable since 16 July 2020 and companies who used to rely on the Privacy Shield had to immediately stop using that mechanism and replace with the SCCs.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Are SCCs enough to transfer data outside of the EU?</strong></h2>
<p>No, SCCs are no longer enough on their own: companies need to assess on a case by case basis whether the laws of the recipient country offer enough protection AND where they don’t, they must include supplementary measures. In addition, if supplementary measures are not possible or insufficient, the parties must suspend, or end transfer OR the transfer must be suspended or ended by the data protection authority.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Now that the EU has issued new SCCs, will these replace the hassle of assessing the recipient’s country protections?</strong></h2>
<p>No – a simple update of the SCCs will not be enough. SCCs “are not capable of binding the authorities of that third country, since they are not party to the contract.” <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" rel="noopener">[7]</a>. Hence, the requirement of implementing technically-enforced supplementary measures.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Is it dangerous not to comply with the Schrems II requirements?</strong></h2>
<p>It’s expensive and it could jeopardize your business since the Data Protection Authority may request to stop the transfer<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" rel="noopener">[8]</a>. In terms of fines provided by the GDPR, we are talking about €20 million or 4% of their global turnover, whichever is greater<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" rel="noopener">[9]</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Is Schrems II a C-Suite / Board level issue? </strong></h2>
<p>Yes- lack of corporate changes may constitute “willful blindness to a course of action” or “reckless conduct by knowing of the risk but doing nothing.”<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" rel="noopener">[10]</a> This opens Board members and senior executives to potential personal and criminal liability.</p>
<h2><strong>6. Can’t I just use encryption or anonymization as Supplementary Measures enough to protect data? </strong></h2>
<p>No – that will not be enough. Encryption only protects data in transit and in storage, and anonymization is not recognized as existing by the European Data Protection Board (“EDPB”). Technically-enforced Supplementary Measures are required<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" rel="noopener">[11]</a>.</p>
<p>Anonymisation is very difficult to very difficult to achieve without deleting important value, and the new requirements under Pseudonymisation entails that the processing of personal data must be accomplished in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, which must be kept separately; and subject to technical and organisational measures able to ensure that the personal data cannot be attributed to identifiable persons without requiring access to the separately and securely stored “additional information.”</p>
<h2><strong>7. What types of processing are now clearly unlawful?</strong></h2>
<p>Two types of transfers have been designated as unlawful by the EDPB:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transfer to Cloud Services Providers or Other Processors Which Require Access to Data in the Clear (EDPB Unlawful Use Case 6); and</li>
<li>Remote Access to Data for Business Purposes (EDPB Unlawful Use Case 7)<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" rel="noopener">[12]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only option to render those as lawful is to provide for encryption.</p>
<h2><strong>8. What’s next for companies?</strong></h2>
<p>Companies need to evaluate what combination of SCCs, Additional Safeguards, data residency and Data Protection by Design and by Default will enable the continued success of business by fostering balanced protection of privacy, as well as legal and contractual trust in the use of technology and in the responsible, protected collection and processing of people’s data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />

<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>One of the positive trends that we’ve seen in recent years is governments and users pressuring companies to simplify their privacy policies and security settings. This comes after a slew of concerning incidents, such as widespread <a target="_blank" href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/94076-the-top-10-data-breaches-of-2020" rel="noopener noreferrer">data breaches</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252487895/Social-media-data-leak-highlights-murky-world-of-data-scraping" rel="noopener noreferrer">data sharing</a> by social media companies.</p>
<p>The spotlight on these issues is beginning to take effect, as Facebook’s latest “<a target="_blank" href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/12/facebook-new-tool-download-personal-information/" rel="noopener">Access Your Information</a>” tool shows, and users are feeling more empowered. Furthermore, in November 2020, Californians voted in favor of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/california-voters-approve-another-overhaul-california-consumer-privacy-laws-meet" rel="noopener noreferrer">new California Privacy Rights Act</a> to strengthen privacy protections for consumers. This is also reinforced by more and more states and countries considering or debating the introduction of comprehensive privacy legislation.</p>
<p>In fact, a recent study found that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.viasatsavings.com/news/blog/are-more-people-public-or-private-on-social-media/" rel="noopener noreferrer">71% of respondents</a> checked their social media platform’s advanced privacy settings when they joined. This is great progress, but we can do more. We know from our research that only 39% of users make sure the site or service they’re using is legitimate, and a mere 12% use a dark web monitoring service. This year’s International <strong>Data </strong><strong>Privacy </strong><strong>Day, January 28th</strong>, is the perfect opportunity to make sure that your sensitive information stays as safe as possible.</p>
<p>The data we are looking to protect, known as Personal Data or , can be anything that relates to your identity. And although many technology users feel that protecting this information is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/" rel="noopener noreferrer">beyond their control</a>, we actually have a lot of simple and effective ways to safeguard our PII. So, let’s start this new year by owning our privacy with a closer look at our social media accounts.</p>
<p>After all, we take pains to safeguard our finances, and the personal data we share on social channels is similar: it has value, and it’s up to us to make sure we take the right steps to keep it protected. Security tools like antivirus software and password managers help enormously in boosting our overall security, but when it comes to social media in particular it’s essential to know what kind of data we’re generating, and how it is used and shared.</p>
<p>First we need to recognize that where we click, “like” and login, all leave a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.internetsociety.org/tutorials/your-digital-footprint-matters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital footprint</a> that can be used to reveal more about your identity and habits than you would think. For example, just using Facebook, Amazon, or Google to login to third-party sites generates an enormous amount of information about where you go and what you do. Many users choose this route because it is easier than creating and remembering passwords to each individual site.</p>
<p>Another way your data gets scattered around is through sharing—whether you intentionally post on social media sites, or use a website, app, or service that permits third-party access of user information. Many users unwittingly agree to this access because it’s buried somewhere in a thick privacy policy.</p>
<p>Now that we know a little more about how your PII gets out, let’s learn how to protect it.</p>
<h3><strong>Here are a few</strong><strong> tips to own your privacy:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Avoid oversharing—</strong>When it comes to social media accounts, set them to share with “friends only.” This should give you some control, but it’s also important to realize that your photos and data can still travel beyond your immediate network, so our best advice is not to post anything you wouldn’t want a future boss to see, for example.</p>
<p>For your other sensitive accounts, check to see which information is being shared, and with whom. If you’re not comfortable with the terms, you can decide to opt out, or close your account.</p>
<p><strong>Check for linked logins—</strong>If you use your Facebook or Google login credentials to log in to other accounts, it’s a good idea to revise the list of sites that have access to your information and pare it down. In many cases you may have visited a site just once, and there is no reason for the third-party site to hold onto your data. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.howtogeek.com/198673/secure-your-online-accounts-by-removing-third-party-app-access/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delete the linked information</a> by visiting the website you used to login in the first place, and create unique login credentials for the sites you visit frequently.</p>
<p><strong>Keep a careful eye on your apps—</strong>Mobile apps have become a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/mobile-and-iot-security/the-latest-mobile-scams-how-to-stay-safe/" rel="noopener">key vector for hackers</a>, so you want to make sure that you only download and install apps from reputable providers that have positive reviews.</p>
<p>For the apps that are already on on your phone or tablet, check the security settings to see if they are accessing more information than they need to work properly. For instance, a mapping app needs your exact physical location, but a gaming app may not. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafeemobilesecurity.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee® Mobile Security</a> can safeguard your devices from malicious files, and help prevent you from oversharing data with apps.</p>
<p><strong>Lose what you don’t use—</strong>If you have accounts for apps or services that you no longer use, it’s time to get rid of them. This prevents them from potentially leaking your information in the future. Just remember that deleting an app doesn’t mean that your data is deleted. For that, you’ll need to close your account.</p>
<p>For the apps you want to keep, make sure they are updated, since updates often contain security fixes. You may also want to recheck the settings to ensure that your data is only being shared if you explicitly allow it.</p>
<p><strong>Let</strong><strong> tech tools help—</strong>Of course, I always recommend that you download security software, and a holistic solution like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" rel="noopener">McAfee Total Protection</a> includes dedicated privacy tools, like a virtual private network (VPN), which scrambles your data while it flows over the network, ensuring that no one else can see it. It also includes safe browsing tools to keep you safer from malicious sites and downloads, and dark web monitoring to help you keep tabs on your personal data.</p>
<p>McAfee also recently released a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/consumer/en-us/landing-page/mcafee-security/download.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">personal protection app</a> (in beta) that monitors the dark web to see if your login credentials have been leaked. If so, it alerts you, so you can change your passwords immediately. It also includes a VPN.</p>
<p><strong>Be careful where you click</strong>—Even the most savvy users can still accidentally click on a dangerous link, so consider using the free McAfee® <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/safe-browser/mcafee-webadvisor.html" rel="noopener">WebAdvisor</a> to alert you to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/stay-connected-protected-weaving-security-into-our-social-media-habits/" rel="noopener noreferrer">risky links and downloads that may be hiding in your newsfeeds and timelines</a>, before you click on them.</p>
<p><strong>Stay aware of the latest scams—</strong>Part of owning your privacy includes staying informed about the latest threats. These <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs" rel="noopener">blogs</a> are a great resource.</p>
<p>This Data Privacy Day make a resolution to take back control of your personal information, and help others do the same. For more information visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://staysafeonline.org/data-privacy-day/" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Cyber Security Alliance</a>.</p>
