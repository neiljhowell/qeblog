										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Digital transformation was gaining momentum before COVID-19 shut down the world last year, but <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-pandemic?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener">the pandemic put the process into hyper-drive</a>. Businesses and consumers have been pushed over a digital fault line where physical channels are moving to digital channels.</p>
<p>While some organizations have scrambled to adjust to this brave new digital world, those that are agile and growth-centric see new opportunities to jump ahead of competitors in their industries. To put more spring into their operations, these organizations are investing in technologies that will make their business operations more agile and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cloud-native-computing-tb/cloud-native-architecture?lx=R4i7m5" rel="noopener">shifting to the cloud</a> for their core operations.</p>
<p>Indeed, to bring new products and experiences to their customers, many businesses have become borderless entities that give customers, employees, suppliers, and other partners access to corporate resources anytime, anywhere. In those environments, access to data is not only important to the members of an organization&#8217;s value chain, but also to the entity itself, which depends on information to gain key business insights, make faster decisions in response to market changes, and stay in tune with customer needs and requirements.</p>
<p>Providing anywhere, anytime access to resources and data—while beneficial for driving efficiency, speed, and flexibility—magnifies the challenges of <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/access-control-pandemic-forces-rethink-its-trust-model" rel="noopener">the challenges of securing the data itself</a><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cloud-security-data-privacy-tb/cloud-security-data-privacy?lx=8rSV2a&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener"> and access to it</a>. These issues are due to the sheer volume and distribution of information created in an anywhere, anytime environment.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why enterprises are placing greater emphasis on <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cloud-security-data-privacy-tb/encryption-vs-tokenization?lx=8rSV2a&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">technologies that protect data and applications</a>, in addition to updating out-of-date policies and procedures for effectively granting access privileges to corporate data wherever it resides.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re on the road to protecting data and applications, it doesn&#8217;t take long to realize the need for cyber resiliency to ensure the business can continue operations in the face of disruptive events such as a pandemic. A key component of establishing cyber resiliency is having a <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cloud-security-data-privacy-tb/cloud-security-data-privacy-trends?lx=8rSV2a&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">comprehensive strategy for data and application protection</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the emerging trends you need to be aware of—and essential best practices—to make cyber resilience happen in your organization.</p>
<h3>The value of data</h3>
<p>First, crafters of such a strategy need to understand the value of data to the business, the liability and risks associated with data, where data resides inside and outside the organization, and the dynamic and distributed nature of data. They also need to know how to classify data.</p>
<p>A comprehensive plan needs to cover the entire data lifecycle—from storage to when it&#8217;s moving to its destruction; otherwise, there&#8217;s a chance of leakage. Having this 360-degree view of data allows for effective decision making to implement the appropriate technologies, policies, and procedures needed for data protection.</p>
<p>Without a 360-degree view of your data, you can end up spending money protecting data that doesn&#8217;t require protection.</p>
<h3>Emerging trends that matter</h3>
<p>As if building a framework and implementing a comprehensive plan to support resiliency weren&#8217;t hard enough, several emerging trends will have a significant impact on how to best manage data, applications, and identities.</p>
<h4>Privacy regulations&#8217; increased complexities </h4>
<p>Measures such as the European Union&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/essential-gdpr-guide-18-resources-get-privacy-compliant" rel="noopener">General Data Protection Regulation</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/what-your-data-security-team-needs-know-about-ccpa" rel="noopener">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> impose restrictions and requirements governing the collection, storage, and handling of data. And more regulatory and legislative actions  in the future will further complicate matters for organizations.</p>
<h4>Software supply chains and the shift required to ensure secure code is embedded in the software development lifecycle</h4>
<p>Increased use of <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/rise-third-party-code-zero-trust-key" rel="noopener">open-source components</a> by enterprise applications has increased supply chain risks. According to <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.sonatype.com/2020-state-of-the-software-supply-chain-report" rel="nofollow noopener">a report</a> by Sonatype, cyber attacks aimed at actively infiltrating open source code increased 430% in 2020 compared to 2019.</p>
<p>By shifting their focus upstream, bad actors can infect a single component, which will then be distributed downstream using legitimate software workflows and update mechanisms, the report said.</p>
<h4>Accelerated digital transformation with the movement of enterprise applications between multi-cloud and on-prem </h4>
<p>Traditional security policies designed to protect on-premises applications are largely ineffective in the cloud. The scale is bigger, and things happen faster than in traditional IT environments. Moreover, there are more things in more places that need to be monitored and protected, which makes automation essential for <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/cloud-misconfigurations-security-5-ways-avoid-your-next-fail" rel="noopener">cloud security</a>.</p>
<h4>The proliferation of connected devices brought about by greater adoption of IoT</h4>
<p>As these devices proliferate, so does <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/7-ways-secure-iot-your-enterprise" rel="noopener">the attack surface</a> for adversaries. Many of the devices connect to IP networks, where they can be attacked from anywhere in the world; can&#8217;t be updated or patched when flaws are discovered; are gaining in capability so they can be used in more sophisticated attacks; and are &#8220;headless,&#8221; so they can be protected only with proximity controls or strong access policies.</p>
<h4>Digital identities and ensuring appropriate governance no matter whether human or a technical element</h4>
<p>Controls need to govern access to resources by people on the network as well as other entities. Use of <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/zero-trust-security-tb/zero-trust-security-matters?lx=9nmHuO&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">zero-trust schemes</a> to govern access has gone from a nice-to-have to a business priority, especially as the remote workforce has ballooned during the pandemic. <a target="_blank" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/latinx/2020/08/19/new-data-from-microsoft-shows-how-the-pandemic-is-accelerating-the-digital-transformation-of-cyber-security/" rel="nofollow noopener">According to Microsoft</a>, 51% of business leaders say they&#8217;re speeding up deployment of zero-trust capabilities, while 94% of companies report they are in the process of implementing new zero-trust systems to some extent.</p>
<h3>Protect your organization&#8217;s value chain</h3>
<p>As the wave of digital transformation breaks over business, protecting data and applications is essential to preserve the integrity of your organization&#8217;s value chain. That protection must foil attacks aimed at compromising data and applications while providing a 360-degree view of data.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll use that view to formulate a comprehensive strategy that will form the bedrock for establishing cyber resiliency throughout your organization.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />

<p>Who recommends cross browser testing to their organizations? </p>
<p>In this series, we discuss the results of the <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/modern-cross-browser-testing-report/" rel="noopener">Applitools Ultrafast Cross Browser Hackathon</a>. Today, we will explain how those who were skeptics about cross browser testing would recommend that their organizations run <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/product-ultrafast-test-cloud/" rel="noopener">Applitools Ultrafast Grid</a> for cross browser testing.</p>
<h2 id="h-reviewing-past-posts-in-this-series">Reviewing Past Posts In This Series</h2>
<p>In this series we have covered the results of the Applitools Ultrafast Cross Browser Hackathon. </p>
<ul>
<li>My <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/effective-cross-browser-testing/" rel="noopener">first post</a> covered the overall results. I wrote specifically about the ease of creating cross browser tests with Applitools and introduced the topics to follow. </li>
<li>My <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/fast-testing-multiple-browsers/" rel="noopener">second post</a> covered how the speed of Applitools Ultrafast Grid makes cross browser testing a reality within the application build process.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/stability-in-cross-browser-test-code/" rel="noopener">In the third</a>, I explained how Applitools Visual AI tests provide much greater code stability compared with legacy cross browser tests, making the code easier to develop and maintain over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this post, I will cover the survey topic in the hackathon: would Hackathon participants recommend that their organizations adopt legacy cross browser testing approach to their peers, and would they recommend Applitools Ultrafast Grid for that purpose?</p>
<h2 id="h-methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>For this survey, Applitools used an approach called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netpromoter.com/know/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Net Promoter Score</a> (NPS). Net Promoter Score uses a survey question with the highest correlation to satisfaction:</p>
<p>“On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being not likely and 10 being highly likely, how likely are you to recommend [the survey object] to others?”</p>
<p>Researchers have shown that this question correlates most highly with satisfaction. Respondents who give a 9 or 10 (highly likely to recommend) get classified as “promoters.” Promoters have high satisfaction. Those who give a 7 or 8 get classified as neutral – they are neither satisfied or dissatisfied. Others with a 6 or below get classified as detractors. Detractors have been dissatisfied with something and have no willingness to recommend the survey object.</p>
<p>Break the survey responses into respondents by value and count. Add 1 for each 10 and 9. Give 0 for each 7 or 8. Subtract 1 for each 6 or below. Then, normalize the results to 100 by taking your count and dividing it by the number of respondents, and multiplying by 100. </p>
<p>Results can range from -100 to 100. According to Bain &amp; Co, the developers of NPS:</p>
<ul>
<li>80 rates as ‘world class’</li>
<li>50 rates as ‘excellent’</li>
<li>20 rates as ‘favorable’</li>
<li>Around 0 rates as ‘neutral’</li>
<li>-10 and lower rates as ‘negative’</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h-asking-hackathon-participants">Asking Hackathon Participants</h2>
<p>Applitools surveyed the the 2,224 Hackathon participants about their willingness to recommend the use of Applitools Ultrafast Grid to their peers. The survey also asked their willingness to recommend the use of legacy cross browser testing.  Of the participants, 203 engineers were able to run both the legacy and the Ultrafast cross browser tests. </p>
<p>Here were the survey responses:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>
<h3 id="h-few-fans-of-traditional-cross-browser-testing">Few Fans Of Traditional Cross Browser Testing</h3>
<p>For legacy cross browser testing, using a traditional test application and validation process, 68% of participants got classified as detractors. 17% got classified as passives. Only 15% promoted the legacy approach. This gave a NPS of -54 (rounded down). Participants were, in general, not fans of legacy cross browser testing.</p>
<p>This result mirrors how much people use the legacy approach to cross browser testing. Companies listed in the graphic above provide the infrastructure to run tests. They don’t reduce the test load, or the code load. Their pricing reflects the cheaper cost  for them to set up and maintain that infrastructure of devices, browsers, operating systems, and viewport sizes. Given the cost of setting up and maintaining legacy cross browser tests, it makes sense that not a lot of companies use cross browser testing actively.</p>
<h3 id="h-willing-to-recommend-applitools-ultrafast-grid-for-cross-browser-testing">Willing to Recommend Applitools Ultrafast Grid for Cross Browser Testing</h3>
<p>Also, the survey asked participants their willingness to recommend Applitools Ultrafast Grid for Cross Browser testing. Here, 75% gave a 10 or 9 and got classified as promoters. Another 20% responded 7 or 8 and got classified as neutral. </p>
<p>The promoters valued:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed of tests – noting they could run their tests in the build process</li>
<li>Simplicity of management – no tests needed to be run and tuned across multiple plaforms</li>
<li>Simplified code management – fewer locators meant easier to set up and manage</li>
<li>More accurate – the underlying Visual AI wasn’t plagued by false positives and caught all the code errors</li>
</ul>
<p>The promoters discovered the ease of creating and maintaining cross browser tests using Applitools Ultrafast Grid. The promoters also realized that, with tests completed and analzyed accurately in well under 10 minutes, Applitools Ultrafast Grid made it possible to run cross browser tests in the scope of a build or during unit tests. Legacy tests, even when run in parallel, took tens of minutes to complete and analyze.</p>
<h2 id="h-implications-of-recommending-cross-browser-testing">Implications of Recommending Cross Browser Testing</h2>
<p>If you read my earlier posts, you know that two camps existed related to cross browser testing. One camp ran cross browser tests because they had encountered issues in the past and saw cross browser tests as a safe approach. The other camp avoided it altogether and thought cross browser testing unnecessary.</p>
<p>There is a third camp using Applitools Ultrafast Grid. This camp recognizes that the combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>test speed appropriate for software build processes</li>
<li>ease of deployment</li>
<li>lack of infrastructure to manage, and </li>
<li>simplified test code management, </li>
</ul>
<p>made cross browser testing feasible. This third camp can deploy Applitools Ultrafast Grid to run and validate rendering behavior for any combination of browser, operating system, and viewport size and run this test set quickly at the unit, build, merge, and final test timeframes. </p>
<p>What then are the implications for the Applitools Ultrafast Cross Browser Hackathon? 75% of the 208 engineers who completed both sets of tests could see the value of Applitools Ultrafast Grid just by using it. And, they would be willing to recommend it.  They realized that, whether they had previously released a bug to the field that they could have caught with cross browser testing, that Ultrafast Grid changed their understanding about this kind of testing completely.</p>
<p>Applitools users know that Applitools Visual AI makes it possible to run visual tests as part of their unit tests. These users can incorporate visual tests at every build and merge. And with Applitools Ultrafast Grid, they can incorporate cross browser tests as well.</p>
<p>Importantly, Hackathon participants learned these lessons just through their time on the Hackathon. </p>
<h2 id="h-what-these-recommendations-mean-for-you">What These Recommendations Mean For You</h2>
<p>When you have 75% of engineers recommending something, it might be worth trying. Whether you classify yourself as a cross browser skeptic or a grudging participant, it is clear that Applitools Ultrafast Grid offers something that differs from your current conception of cross browser testing. </p>
<p>At the very least, read the Applitools results in detail. You will learn why the engineers gave these recommendations.</p>
<p>More importantly, why not give Applitools a try? Sign up for a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.applitools.com/free/" rel="noreferrer noopener">free account</a>? Or, if you prefer, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.applitools.com/request-demo/" rel="noreferrer noopener">request a demo</a> from an Applitools representative. </p>
<h2 id="h-next-week">Next Week</h2>
<p>Next week, in my last blog post in this series, I will help you draw your own conclusions about Modern Cross Browser Testing.</p>

<p><strong>Apple and Google are under fire yet again</strong> for allowing scam apps into their curated app stores: Apple for permitting useless clone apps that sneakily charge recurring fees, and Google for not dealing with once-good apps that go rogue.</p>
<p><strong>There are no good app stores.</strong> There, I said it. Change my mind.</p>
<p><strong>It’s all about the mighty dollar.</strong> In this week’s <i><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/contributors/richi-jennings" rel="noopener">Security Blogwatch</a></i>, we follow the money.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://richi.uk/" rel="noopener nofollow" title="Richi Jennings">Your humble blogwatcher</a> curated these bloggy bits for your entertainment. Not to mention: <em>BOOM.</em></p>
<h3>A plague on both your houses</h3>
<p><strong>What’s the craic?</strong> Dan Goodin reports—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/android-barcode-scanner-with-10-million-downloads-infects-users/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Android barcode scanner with 10 million+ downloads infects users</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Barcode Scanner, one of dozens of such apps available in the official Google app repository, began its life as a legitimate offering. Then in late December … ads were opening out of nowhere. … An update delivered in December included code that was responsible for the bombardment.<br />…<br />Google [has] removed the app. … So far, however, Google has yet to use its Google Play Protect tool to remove the app from devices that had it installed. … Anyone who has a barcode scanner installed on an Android device should inspect it.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>How can we tell?</strong> Thomas Claburn explainifies—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/08/barcode_scan_app_malwarebytes_update/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Barcode scan app amassed millions of downloads before weird update</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Barcode Scanner, distributed by a London-based company called LavaBird, received an update on December 4, 2020, that appears to have introduced the code in question. … LavaBird&#8217;s now-banished Android app shouldn&#8217;t be confused with ZXing Team&#8217;s Barcode Scanner that remains in the Play Store.<br />…<br />LavaBird … is run by Dmytro Kizema, a resident of Ukraine. [It] was incorporated in March, 2020 [but] those involved appear to have been using variations on that name for several years and have other apps that they use to sell traffic to advertisers.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Who discovered it?</strong> Nathan Collier slightly over-hypes the scale of the problem—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/android/2021/02/barcode-scanner-app-on-google-play-infects-10-million-users-with-one-update/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Barcode Scanner app on Google Play infects 10 million users with one update</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Late last December we started getting a distress call. … One patron, who goes by username Anon00, discovered that it was coming from a long-time installed app, Barcode Scanner. An app that has 10,000,000+ installs from Google Play.<br />…<br />We predict … the update occurred on December 4th. … Malicious code had been added that was not in previous versions of the app. Furthermore, the added code used heavy obfuscation to avoid detection. … We confirmed it had been signed by the same digital certificate as previous clean versions.<br />…<br />It is frightening that with one update an app can turn malicious while going under the radar of Google Play Protect. … Because there are so many other legitimate barcode and QR scanners on Google Play, [here’s the] app information:<br />Publisher: LavaBird LTD<br />App Name: Barcode Scanner<br />MD5: A922F91BAF324FA07B3C40846EBBFE30<br />Package Name: com.qrcodescanner.barcodescanner.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>As opposed to other apps with the same name?</strong> Thus spake <i><a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/android-barcode-scanner-with-10-million-downloads-infects-users/?comments=1&amp;post=39646011#comment-39646011" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">marsilies</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>I use an app called &#8220;Barcode Scanner&#8221; that&#8217;s not the malware app. However, the recent reviews blast it for adware, which I haven&#8217;t noticed. I think having the exact same name has caused some people to post negative reviews on the wrong app.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>As wooped</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26063924" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">wooptoo</a></i>, too: <em>[You’re fired—Ed.]</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>This is possibly tied to the recent assault on the ZXing Barcode scanner app. This is a legit open source app that&#8217;s been recently flooded by 1-star reviews claiming that the app contains malware, probably in order to get users to switch to the other apps.</p>
<p>The funny thing is this app has not been updated since 2019 on the Play Store, so those reviews are clearly bogus. It takes a special kind of scum to slander an open source project in order to push malware.</p>
<p></em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>And this problem isn’t unique to Android.</strong> Tim Hardwick explains—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/scam-apps-ios-making-millions-revenue/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Scam iOS Apps Still Raking in Millions in Revenue on App Store</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>The problem of scam iOS apps has dogged Apple&#8217;s App Store for some years now. … Scammers prey on and exploit the work of genuine app developers. … The developer Kosta Eleftheriou has taken to Twitter to highlight that the problem remains as big as ever in at least some app categories – and also offered iOS users a way to spot them.<br />…<br />According to Eleftheriou, there are several clones of his … app, but one of the most clear non-functional rip-offs … launched with a blank interface and an &#8220;Unlock now&#8221; button. Tapping the button prompted users to confirm an $8/week subscription—for an app that doesn&#8217;t do anything.<br />…<br />[He said] the scam achieved prominence in the App Store by gaming Apple&#8217;s algorithmic ranking system through the purchase of fake ratings and glowing five-star reviews, which bumped it up to the top of its app category. It even advertised its software using his own promotional video.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Old news, I hear you cry?</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26069947" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">alex331</a></i> counts the days:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It&#8217;s been a week since this issue [was] highlighted. And a week since Apple still hasn&#8217;t said a single thing. This is sad.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>IANAL, and neither is</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=18218238&amp;cid=61041426" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">Anubis IV</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Not a lawyer here, but it even seems as if there may be a case for fraud. … If they&#8217;re stealing someone else&#8217;s videos, posting them as their own, delivering a non-functioning app, and charging users $8/week for the privilege of using said app, the App Store might be well-served by Apple going after them in court.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Cui bono?</strong> With an eye on Apple’s 30%, <i><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26054879" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">ekurutepe</a></i> blames Tim Apple:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I&#8217;m sure Apple wants to do the right thing but they&#8217;ve set themselves up badly from the top down in this case: Tim Cook has been promising (and delivering) services revenue and subscriber count growth since 2016. If your employer says services revenue growth is the most important thing, people do respond to incentives even if they&#8217;re aware of it or not.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Meanwhile,</strong> what’s the best way to curate an app store? <i><a target="_blank" href="https://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=18208056&amp;cid=61036706" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" title="read the full text">arglebargle_xiv</a></i> comment YOU:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Google method is much more economical. Google asks Google Play authors, &#8220;Are you Russian hacker?&#8221; and if reply is &#8220;Nyet!&#8221; then app gets approved.</em></p></blockquote>
<h3>The moral of the story?</h3>
<p>Watch out for scam clones of your app, and for bad reviews targeting similarly named apps.</p>
<h3>And finally</h3>

<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>In November last year, we lost our much-loved family dog. We were all so devasted. Harley was a very handsome black and white Cavoodle who died from a paralysis tick bite after giving us 12 years of love. After lots of tears and weeks of sadness, we have decided it’s time to start our search for another fur baby.</p>
<p>But it seems we are not the only ones in the market for a new puppy. Thanks to COVID and our new very home focussed lives, puppies have been in hot demand since early 2020 and they still are. What better way to deal with lockdown loneliness and a home-based existence than a brand-new ball of fluff!</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks, I’ve spoken to multiple breeders from all around Australia who have over 50 families waiting for a puppy! A Portuguese Water Dog breeder told me yesterday that it would be 2023 before she could offer me a puppy!! So,</p>
<p>And this trend hasn’t gone unnoticed by cybercriminals with <a target="_blank" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/life/2020/11/24/puppy-prices-peak-as-scams-increase-fourfold-on-last-year/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) reporting a four-fold increase in puppy scams in 2020!! In fact, a whopping $1.6 million was scammed from unsuspecting Aussies simply looking for a ball of fur to love between January and October 2020.</a></p>
<p>So, how do you avoid being caught up in a puppy scam and losing money? Here’s what I’m doing to ensure we don’t get swindled while we search for our new puppy:</p>
<h2><strong>1. Take Your Time</strong></h2>
<p>Cybercriminals rely on us being in a rush and not doing our homework. A quick google search for popular dog breeds such as Cavoodles, Labradors or Dachshunds will yield pages of results, not all of them legit!</p>
<p>Scammers are very talented at making their sites look genuine. They will copy photos of puppies and breeders from legitimate sites and will even use certificates and identification numbers from these legitimate breeders too. Quite often the only detail that differs is the contact telephone number and email address.</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram ads are also created using these details too making it very hard to identify what is legitimate and what isn’t.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Do Your Homework</strong></h2>
<p>Doing your due diligence is the best way to prevent becoming a victim of a puppy scam. Even if the person on the end of the phone sounds delightful and the pictures are gorgeous, you owe it to yourself – and your bank account – to ensure you are dealing with a legitimate breeder. Here’s what I recommend you do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google the name of the breeder to ascertain whether they have NOT been caught up in a scam.</li>
<li>Always ring the association that the breeder says they are registered with and crosscheck all the information you have been given.</li>
<li>As most puppies come vaccinated and microchipped, ask the breeder to share contact details of the veterinary clinic the puppy has been to.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>3. Photos and Video Chat</strong></h2>
<p>If you are not able to pick up your pet in person, requesting photos and even a video call with the breeder and your potential puppy is essential.</p>
<p>Ask the breeder for multiple photos of the pet with specific items – this help you ascertain that the pet is real and not photoshopped. A recent newspaper is a great item to suggest.</p>
<p>However, a video call is probably the best way of giving you total piece of mind. Yes, it maybe crazy and noisy but there’s nothing like seeing something with your own eyes to satisfy yourself that it is real and not photoshopped!</p>
<h2><strong>4. Trust Your Gut</strong></h2>
<p>We all have a 6<sup>th</sup> sense and now is the time to use it:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the breeder is trying to push for the sale as they are moving to a new house or are unwell, be suspicious.</li>
<li>If the breeder is putting pressure on you to deposit funds to secure your puppy ASAP, be suspicious.</li>
<li>If the breeder is asking an inflated price for the pet, be suspicious. Do your research so you know what an average asking price would be.</li>
<li>If email communication with breeder has signs of broken English or poor grammar, be very suspicious.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can’t imagine our family without pets. They play such an important, cohesive role and we take such joy in sharing photos of our crazy cats and their weird antics on our family group chat.</p>
<p>Next week, we are going to pickup our new puppy. After much debate about breeds, we have chosen a tri coloured beaglier – male of course! The breeder sounds delightful over the phone and the pictures are gorgeous. But just to ensure total piece of mind, I am driving nearly 7 hours to pick up our new fur baby in person. I’ll be sure to share some photos!</p>
<p>Happy pet shopping!</p>
