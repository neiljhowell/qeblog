<p>When discussing AI in test automation, you might be thinking: ‚ÄúOh well, here‚Äôs another buzzword in our testing field‚Äù‚Ä¶ But let‚Äôs face it, AI (Artificial Intelligence) ‚Äúbuzzword‚Äù keeps on coming up over the past couple of years and seems to be here to stay, and rapidly transforming the testing landscape. Instead of being intimidated by the change, let‚Äôs embrace it, and what better way than with a <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">solution</a> that has AI built into its technology <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>TestProject recently added¬†<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/08/25/testprojects-smart-recorder-adds-ai-powered-self-healing-technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI powered Self Healing technology</a> to its Selenium-based Smart Test Recorder. Since TestProject is built on top of Selenium, you now can get the benefits of Selenium with additional AI features to save a bunch of time and overcome the most common and difficult testing challenges, and all 100% for free.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, we were thrilled to host 800+ eager webinar participants to demonstrate this AI technology of TestProject. We collected dozens of questions over the 1-hour session, and have answered the most common questions for you below.</p>
<p>The following Q&#038;As can shed light over how AI works in test automation in general, and particularly when utilizing TestProject <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="‚ú®" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2><strong>Out-of-the-box AI Self Healing Technology</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I view the full webinar recording?</strong><br />A: Directly from our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/testproject" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject YouTube channel</a>, or here:</p>
<p> <iframe title="[Webinar Recording] Introducing The TestProject New AI Powered Self Healing Technology" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H45aSXTPDdg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Q: How do the AI self-healing features work?</strong><br />A: <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a>‚Äôs AI works for you, both during the Recording &#038; Execution of your tests!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When recording a test</strong>, you will be notified if there‚Äôs a better, more stable way, to run the test and allow you to review and confirm the proposed changes.</li>
<li><strong>When executing a test</strong>, if a self-healing mechanism was used to recover from an error, an indication will appear in your report.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q: Is this a native built-in option, or should I install some Addon?</strong><br />A: TestProject AI-powered Self Healing technology is built-in the Web Test Recorder. No need to install anything other than the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.testproject.io/testproject-agents/what-is-a-testproject-agent" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject Agent</a>. Just make sure you are using Agent version 0.64.0 or higher.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is the self-healing capability available also within the Mobile Test Recorder as well as the Web Test Recorder?</strong><br />A: It will be added to the Mobile Test Recorder by Q4.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I need to reinstall/upgrade the TestProject Agent to access the new AI self-healing version?</strong><br />A: You simply need to install/update your TestProject Agent to version 0.64.0 or higher.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I have to use the AI features? Can I modify the AI-selected locator?</strong><br />A: TestProject‚Äôs AI features are designed to be non-intrusive. You can always override suggested locators with your own by making them primary or removing the automatically generated ones. In addition, you can always change (or remove) any alternative strategies from the elements management page.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the benefits of these AI Self-Healing capabilities?</strong><br />A: This revolutionary technology provides a number of new capabilities to further enhance the Smart Test Recorder, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic Self-Healing capabilities, with AI to monitor your tests and select the most¬†robust selector strategy¬†for your elements, and can even¬†repair tests on the fly¬†if needed.</li>
<li>Best-in-class support for iFrames, Popups, Dynamic Elements and more. Learn more about how we help overcome these challenges in <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/09/01/overcome-7-selenium-challenges-with-testprojects-smart-recorder/" rel="noopener noreferrer">this tutorial</a>.</li>
<li>Streamlined user interface, accelerating test creation and management of advanced features like <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Addons</a>, parameters, and more.</li>
<li>Improved performance, for¬†lightning-quick¬†test creation, element identification, and test debugging.</li>
<li>Full compatibility with the most complex enterprise web apps, including Salesforce, SAP Fiori, MS Sharepoint, and ServiceNow.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/05/04/testproject-adaptive-wait-capability/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adaptive-Wait</a> automatically handles deviations in web application loading times.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q: Does TestProject support objects within iFrames and enables them to switch back to normal frame objects?</strong><br />A: Yes, TestProject‚Äôs AI-powered test recorder supports iFrames out-of-the-box, you don‚Äôt need to do anything special for that.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do we need to perform any auto-adjust when the iFrame loads in a dynamic position or in a resized height?</strong><br />A: No, there is no need to adjust anything since the iFrames are supported automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens if the element locators are changed? Will the test still proceed or will it fail?</strong><br />A: For each element, TestProject‚Äôs AI will search for the most stable locator before proceeding with the test, as more than a single locator is stored for each element.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is there something special we need to do in order to enable this AI self-healing technology?¬†</strong><br />A: The self-healing will work automatically and it will work on all types of locators.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is there an element repository? Meaning, if ‚Äúname2‚Äù is broken across many tests, is there a way to update in ONE place for all tests that use the element?</strong><br />A: Yes, with TestProject‚Äôs Page Object Model, all of your elements are stored in one streamlined repository in the ‚ÄúElements‚Äù section within each Project.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is there an indicator on the test reports of the self-healing that occurred?</strong><br />A: Each test step that was self-healed has a heart icon to represent it on the test report. See below an example of the heart icon on step 2 &#038; 3:</p>

<p><strong>Q: How is it possible to save the CSS locator when recording an element? By default, is it the XPath that is saved? Can we filter which type of locator the AI will be looking for? For instance, only CSS or only XPath?</strong><br />A: By default, we will save more than one locator for each element (both CSS/XPath). If you want to override the default locator with a custom attribute, or a combination of custom attributes, you can do it on the application level ‚Äì that will force the recorder to look for a custom attribute first Here is a <a target="_blank" href="https://intercom.help/testprojectio/en/articles/4449063-setting-application-s-custom-attributes" rel="noopener noreferrer">short tutorial</a> of how to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the best way to identify elements on a web page? Should we use ID, XPath, or unique attributes like ‚Äúdata-qa‚Äù?</strong><br />A: TestProject‚Äôs Smart Test Recorder will automatically identify the best locators based on your application layout (typically more than one). You can always edit each element to learn what are the best locator strategies it picks for you. If you do the mapping manually, then ID‚Äôs, Custom CSS, and Custom attributes are preferred.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens if the AI Self-healing cannot find an element?</strong><br />A: If an element cannot be located, the step will fail and probably for a good reason <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will the self-healing work at all times? Are there any challenges or scenarios in which the self-healing will fail to work?</strong><br />A: Yes, if the element completely changed its characterization in more than one way, we will prefer to fail the step where the certainty is not high and you might get false-positive results.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are the AI self-healing capabilities available only within the Test Recorder, or also when developing coded tests with the TestProject <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/14/announcing-testproject-new-opensdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenSDK</a>?</strong><br />A: At this point, these capabilities are available within the Smart Test Recorder only.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is TestProject really offering all of this for free? Is it Open Source?</strong><br />A: TestProject is part of Tricentis, a well-funded company that is the leader in software testing. This provides the resources to create tools to offer TestProject at no cost to our users, for the benefit of giving back to the testing community. TestProject is based on open source (Selenium and Appium) and its SDK is 100% open source. So, YES, <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a> is 100% FREE forever.

<h2><strong> Special Delivery: Don‚Äôt Fall for the USPS SMiShing Scam</strong></h2>
<p>According to Statista, 3.5 billion people worldwide are forecasted to own a smartphone by the end of 2020. These connected devices allow us to have a wealth of apps and information constantly at our fingertips ‚Äì empowering us to remain in constant contact with loved ones, make quick purchases, track our fitness progress, you name it. Hackers are all too familiar with our reliance on our smartphones ‚Äì and are eager to exploit them with stealthy tricks as a result.</p>
<p>One recent example of these tricks? Suspicious text messages claiming to be from USPS. According to <a target="_blank" href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/Dkk1CzKnJIR00kmS4mijw?domain=gizmodo.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gizmodo</a>, a recent SMS phishing scam is using the USPS name and fraudulent tracking codes to trick users into clicking on malicious links.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs dive into the details of this scheme, what it means for users, and what you can do to protect yourself from SMS phishing.</p>
<h3>Special Delivery: Suspicious Text Messages</h3>
<p>To orchestrate this phishing scheme, hackers send out text messages from random numbers claiming that a user‚Äôs delivery from USPS, FedEx, or another delivery service is experiencing a transit issue that requires urgent attention. If the user clicks on the link in the text, the link will direct them to a form fill page asking them to fill in their personal and financial information to ‚Äúverify their purchase delivery.‚Äù If the form is completed, the hacker could exploit that information for financial gain.</p>
<p>However, scammers also use this phishing scheme to infect users‚Äô devices with malware. For example, some users received links claiming to provide access to a supposed USPS shipment. Instead, they were led to a domain that did nothing but infect their browser or phone with malware. Regardless of what route the hacker takes, these scams leave the user in a situation that compromises their smartphone and personal data.</p>

<h3>Don‚Äôt Fall for Delivery Scams</h3>
<p>While delivery alerts are a convenient way to track packages, it‚Äôs important to familiarize yourself with the signs of phishing scams ‚Äì especially as we approach the holiday shopping season. Doing so will help you safeguard your online security without sacrificing the convenience of your smartphone. To do just that, follow these actionable steps to help secure your devices and data from SMiShing schemes:</p>
<h3>Go directly to the source</h3>
<p>Be skeptical of text messages claiming to be from companies with peculiar asks or information that seems too good to be true. Instead of clicking on a link within the text, it‚Äôs best to go straight to the organization‚Äôs website to check on your delivery status or contact customer service.</p>
<h3>Enable the feature on your mobile device that blocks certain texts</h3>
<p>Many spammers send texts from an internet service in an attempt to hide their identities. Combat this by using the feature on your mobile device that blocks texts sent from the internet or unknown users. For example, you can disable all potential <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-block-robotexts-and-spam-messages" rel="noopener noreferrer">spam messages</a> from the Messages app on an Android device by navigating to Settings, clicking on Spam protection, and turning on the Enable spam protection switch. Learn more about how you can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-block-robotexts-and-spam-messages" rel="noopener noreferrer">block robotexts and spam messages</a> on your device.</p>
<h3>Use mobile security software</h3>
<p>Prepare your mobile devices for any threat coming their way. To do just that, cover these devices with an extra layer of protection via a mobile security solution, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/android.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee Mobile Security.</a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[How far away are we from machines making safer¬†software, faster? We might be closer than you think.¬† Other than ensuring]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>How far away are we from machines making safer¬†software, faster? We might be closer than you think.¬†</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other than ensuring that your people are happy and engaged, digital innovation is the best¬†source of competitiveness and value creation for almost every type of business. As a result, three things are increasingly common among corporate software engineering teams and the 20 million software developers who work for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">They seek faster innovation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">They seek improved security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">They utilize a massive volume of open-source libraries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The universal desire for faster innovation demands efficient reuse of code, which in turn has led to a growing dependence on open-source and third-party software libraries. These artifacts serve as reusable building blocks, which are fed into public repositories where they are freely borrowed by millions of developers in the pursuit of faster innovation.</p>
<p>This is the definition of the modern technology supply chain‚Äîand more specifically, a <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/2019-state-software-supply-chain-report-5-key-takeaways" rel="noopener noreferrer">software supply chain</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Organizations that invest in securing the best parts, from the fewest and best suppliers, and keeping those components updated, are widening the gap against their competitors. The best-performing organizations are applying automation to help them manage their open-source component choices and updates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As these practices evolve, machines will become better at guiding developers to the best-quality and most secure component versions. And in the not-too-distant future, machines may be compiling the best components into application code based on functional requirements defined upfront.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here&#8217;s why automation should be a key strategy for helping you select open-source components, and other lessons from my team&#8217;s research.</p>
<h3>Beware of the proxies</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/2019-accelerate-state-devops-report-how-elites-drive-high-performance" rel="noopener noreferrer">The¬†2019¬†State of DevOps Report</a>¬†found that¬†elite organizations are deploying 200 times more frequently than their peers, and their change failure rates are seven¬†times lower. They&#8217;re also much faster in¬†mean time to recover from failure than other organizations.</p>
<p>But these kinds of metrics¬†are¬†really focused on¬†how you&#8217;re doing internally as a development team and don&#8217;t take into account many external factors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This reminds me of what Jeff Bezos¬†said in his 2017 letter to shareholders: &#8220;Beware of the proxies.&#8221;¬†You can get so focused on a process, and doing that process well, that it becomes the thing that you&#8217;re trying to achieve.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You might be trying to achieve faster deployments, faster mean times to recovery, or more secure code releases. They can represent your proxies for success, while not necessarily contributing to the outcome your business is attempting to achieve.</p>
<h4>Who&#8217;s faster?</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Consider adversaries who attack your code. If you can release new security updates in your codebase within two weeks, but your adversaries can find and exploit the new vulnerabilities in two days, your organization&#8217;s data is at risk.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In this situation, it does not matter as much that you&#8217;ve already reduced your time to implement security updates fivefold¬†if your adversaries are still faster.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Consider this¬†real-world scenario. On Wednesday, April 29, 2020, the creators¬†and maintainers¬†of SaltStack, an open-source application, announced that the app had a critical vulnerability. On the very same day, they released the safe version of the application. If you had automatic updates turned on from SaltStack, you got the newer version. If you didn&#8217;t, then you needed to get the newer version, update your infrastructure, and do so before the adversaries found it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the researchers at F-Secure said that¬†&#8220;the vulnerability was so critical, this was a patch-by-Friday-or-be-breached-by-Monday kind of situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>And¬†that&#8217;s exactly what happened. By Saturday morning, May 2, some¬†18 people on GitHub reported that breaches were actively happening. They had lost control of their servers. SaltStack had been taken over, rogue code was executing on their systems, and their firewalls were being disabled. Throughout May, 27 breaches were recorded.</p>
<h3>Accelerate¬†development</h3>
<p>But not all¬†of the news is bad: We know that developers are getting faster, too, because they&#8217;re not writing all of their code themselves.<br />¬†</p>
<p><em>Figure 1:¬†Number of download requests for Java component releases, 2012 to¬†2020, from the Central Repository.¬†Source: 2020 State of the Software Supply Chain Report</em></p>
<p>We&#8217;re assembling more and more code from open-source¬†components and packages. As one example, it&#8217;s amazing to look at download volumes for the npm package manager. There were¬†95 billion npm package downloads in July 2020. If you annualize that¬†download volume, we¬†would see¬†over 1.1 trillion npm package downloads this year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In Java, similar things are happening. In 2019, Maven Central had 226 billion download requests. In 2020, download request volumes are expected to hit 376 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">How do these monstrous numbers translate to your own developers and applications? After analyzing 1,500 unique applications, we can see that 90% of their code footprint is built from open-source software components.</p>
<h3>Build¬†the best code</h3>
<p>As I started thinking about all of the above, I wanted to understand not just how these parts are being used, but where they are coming from¬†and who the open-source software suppliers are. So, in a two-year-long collaboration,¬†<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/RealGeneKim" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gene Kim</a>,¬†<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-magill-2070a096/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stephen Magill</a>, and I examined software release patterns and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/open-source-risk-4-application-security-action-items" rel="noopener noreferrer">cybersecurity hygiene practices</a> across 30,000 commercial development teams and open-source projects.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We set out to understand what attributes we could¬†use to identify the best open-source project performance and practices. If development teams were going to assemble applications from these building blocks, we wanted to understand who the best suppliers were.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We wanted to know who released most often, who were the most popular suppliers, who prioritized features over security¬†or security over features, who enlisted automated build tools, which projects were consistently well staffed, and more. All of these variables played a role in identifying suppliers with the best track records, because they would be the ones to help developers build the best applications.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, the more you could teach machines to identify the attributes of the best open-source software¬†suppliers for developers, the faster development could become.</p>
<h3>Lessons from our open-source projects</h3>
<p>The top-performing projects released 1.5 times¬†more frequently than the rest of the teams we studied,¬†were 2.5 times more popular by download count, had 1.4 times larger development teams, and managed 2.9 times¬†fewer dependencies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We also saw a strong correlation between open source¬†projects that updated dependencies more frequently and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/open-source-security-4-metrics-matter-app-sec-teams" rel="noopener noreferrer">their ability to maintain more secure code</a>. High-performing projects demonstrated a median time to update (MTTU) their dependencies that was 530¬†times faster than other projects. By moving to the latest dependencies, they purposely or consequently remediated known vulnerabilities discovered in older dependencies.</p>
<p><em>Figure 2: Open-source project cluster analysis of popularity and release speed. Source: 2019 State of the Software Supply Chain Report</em></p>
<p>To better understand all this, we performed a cluster analysis of these different open-source projects based on several¬†attributes. We were able to see what development teams should focus on when choosing components.</p>
<p>Choosing open-source projects should be considered an important strategic decision for enterprise software development organizations. Different components demonstrate healthy or poor performance that affects the overall quality of their releases.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, MTTU should be an important metric when deciding which components to use within your software supply chains. Rapid MTTU is associated with lower security risk, and it&#8217;s accessible from public sources.</p>
<h3>Update your¬†open-source components regularly</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Just as traditional manufacturing supply chains intentionally select parts from approved suppliers and rely upon formalized procurement practices,¬†enterprise development teams should adopt similar criteria for their selection of open-source software¬†components.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This practice ensures that the highest-quality parts are selected from the best and fewest suppliers. Implementing selection criteria and updated practices will not only improve code quality, but can accelerate mean time to repair when suppliers discover new defects or vulnerabilities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ideally, dependencies should be updated‚Äîsimply, safely, and painlessly, and as part of the routine development process. But reality shows that this ideal is rarely met.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An astonishing story of how far an organization can stray from ideal update practices comes from <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/eileencodes" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Eileen M. Uchitelle</a>, staff engineer at GitHub, who said it took seven years to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIScxVu00bs" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">successfully migrate GitHub</a> from a forked version of Rails 2 to Rails 5.32.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even with new tools available to developers that automatically create pull requests with updated dependencies, changes in APIs and potential breakage can still hold back many developers from updating. We suspect this change-induced breakage is a primary driver of poor updating practices.</p>
<h3>A tale of three¬†open source component releases</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Taking a deeper dive into the vast data available to us from the Central Repository, the world&#8217;s largest collection of open-source components,¬†you can better visualize open-source project releases and their adoption by enterprise application development teams that migrate from one version to a newer one. We believe this data shows how open-source component selection can play a major role in allowing for easier and more frequent updates.</p>
<p><em>Figure 3:¬†Migration patterns between component releases for the joda-time library.¬†Source: 2020 State of the Software Supply Chain Report</em></p>
<p>Consider the widely used joda-time library, which shows that developers using this open-source component update fairly uniformly between all pairs of versions. This suggests that updates are easy, presenting a seemingly homogeneous set of versions to¬†migrate to and from.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><em>Figure 4:¬†Migration patterns between component releases for the hibernate-validator library.¬†Source: 2020 State of the Software Supply Chain Report</em></p>
<p>On the opposite extreme, consider the graph for the hibernate-validator library, where there are two sets of communities using it‚Äîone favoring version 5 and another preferring version 6. The two communities very rarely intersect. This suggests either that updating to version 6 from version 5 is too difficult¬†or that the value is not worth the effort.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Figure 5:¬†Migration patterns between component releases for the spring-core library.¬†Source: 2020 State of the Software Supply Chain Report</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, we take a look at the pattern for spring-core, which suggests that updating is sufficiently difficult that the effort must be planned and some version ranges end up being avoided.</p>
<h3>Will machines make software?</h3>
<p>If you are a developer, don&#8217;t worry; your job is secure. No machine out there will take your place. Having said that, an increased reliance on automation to help you select better, higher-quality, and more secure components can serve you and your teams well today.</p>
<p>You can use automation, through advanced software composition analysis and open-source-governance tools, to point to better suppliers with a better track record‚Äîfor instance,¬†they release often, update vulnerabilities quickly, are well staffed, and are popular.</p>
<p>Using these tools to set policies around components can help you determine when to upgrade your dependencies, and they can quickly inform you of newly discovered vulnerabilities in need of remediation. Additionally, these tools can lead developers to the best versions of components, indicating which newer versions will introduce the fewest breaking changes or introduce troublesome dependencies.</p>

<p>Early January this year, Applitools announced the results of their<a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/hackathon-winners/" rel="noopener noreferrer">¬†</a><a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/hackathon-winners/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual AI Rockstar Hackathon winners</a>¬†of which I am lucky to be included as one of their silver winners. I blogged about my experience as to how I approached the hackathon and my honest feedback as to why I think it‚Äôs modernising the way we do test automation which you can find in this post ‚Äì<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mariedrake.com/post/applitools-modernising-the-way-we-do-test-automation" rel="noopener noreferrer">¬†</a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mariedrake.com/post/applitools-modernising-the-way-we-do-test-automation" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools: Modernising the way we do test automation</a>.</p>
<p>6 months in and they announced another hackathon but this time the focus is on cross browser testing via<a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/product-ultrafast-test-cloud/" rel="noopener noreferrer">¬†</a><a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/product-ultrafast-test-cloud/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultrafast Grid</a>¬†and comparing it with traditional solutions such as running the same functional tests on different browsers and viewports locally. I participated in the hackathon again and ended up as one of their gold winners this time, which I‚Äôm extremely pleased, because not only did I win one of their amazing prizes but also, I improved my technical skill and learned a lot about the true cost of cross browser testing.</p>
<h2 id="h.bgexigit1a13">Why Automated Cross Browser Testing?</h2>
<p>First, let‚Äôs talk about why cross browser testing? Why another hackathon?</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre like me and have been testing web applications for some time, you‚Äôll know that cross browser testing is a pain and time consuming to test. There is no way you can test 100% cross browser coverage, unless you have a lot of time and want to devote all your testing efforts in cross browser testing alone plus don‚Äôt forget that you also need to check on other viewports. In time, it gets really boring and tedious. This is why it‚Äôs a great idea to automate cross browser tests as much as possible so we can focus on other areas where we are also needed such as exploratory and accessibility testing.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there are not a lot of functional differences between different browsers. The code that gets deployed is mostly similar on any platform but the way the code is rendered visually exposes differences that we need to catch. Rather than doing cross browser functional testing where we are testing the functionality across different browsers, a better alternative is to do cross browser visual testing instead where we validate the look of our pages instead because this is what our users see.</p>
<p>The problem is automated cross browser testing, whether it‚Äôs functional or visual, can still take a considerable amount of time to set up because you need to create an automation framework that can scale and easily be maintained. This can be quite a challenge for testers who are considerably new in test automation.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>
<p>Cross Browser Testing in a nutshell</p>
<p>The purpose of this hackathon was to show how easy and how fast cross browser visual testing can be if you‚Äôre using modern tools such as Applitools. It‚Äôs also to highlight that existing testing tools are great for doing cross browser <em>functional</em>¬†testing but not so great with cross browser <em>visual </em>testing which I‚Äôll expand on later.</p>
<h2 id="h.k31gr9jtrxn7">The Hackathon Experience: Cypress</h2>
<p>The hackathon was split into automating three different scenarios for a sample e-commerce website called<a target="_blank" href="https://demo.applitools.com/gridHackathonV1.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">¬†</a><a target="_blank" href="https://demo.applitools.com/gridHackathonV1.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppliFashion</a>. The scenarios should be automated using any testing tool of your choice and also with the same testing tool but with using Applitools alongside. The automated tests will then be executed on two versions of the website ‚Äì version 1, which is assumed to be bug free, and version 2, which has new bugs added in. On version 2, you have to update the automated tests to fix the bugs introduced and then compare the effort of doing this with the traditional testing tool that you have chosen as opposed to using Applitools.</p>
<p>I decided to use Cypress as my testing tool and while it‚Äôs a great tool for automating the browser, I spent 5.5 hours doing cross browser visual¬†testing with this approach and still felt that I missed a lot of visual bugs. Let‚Äôs look at this in more detail.</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing Cypress: <strong>5 mins</strong></li>
<li>Writing tests for version 1: <strong>2 hours</strong></li>
<li>Test maintenance for version 2 and finding bugs: <strong>1 hour</strong></li>
<li>Test reporting and project refactoring: <strong>2 hours</strong></li>
<li>Documentation: <strong>30 mins</strong></li>
<li><strong>Total Time: 5 hrs, 35 mins</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Writing the tests took quite some time. I needed to verify a lot of the elements and get their selectors so I could assert that they were visible on the page. Some of the elements were hidden if you¬†are on different viewports so these had to be reflected on the tests. You can find an example code on how I handled this on my<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mdcruz/applitools-ufg-hackathon/blob/master/TraditionalTestsV1/cypress/integration/task3.spec.js" rel="noopener noreferrer">¬†</a><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mdcruz/applitools-ufg-hackathon/blob/master/TraditionalTestsV1/cypress/integration/task3.spec.js" rel="noopener noreferrer">applitools ultrafast grid github repo</a>. The test execution time was also slightly longer because I had more viewports (desktop, tablet, mobile) and browsers (Chrome and Firefox) to cover locally.</p>
<p>When it was time to run the same test on version 2, I had to make some adjustments to my tests and log the bugs that my automated tests found. This took me an hour because I had to update the selectors to fix my tests but also, I wasn‚Äôt confident that my tests found all the visual bugs on version 2.¬†I had to find some of the bugs manually since verifying CSS changes was difficult for me with just using Cypress alone.</p>
<p>When it came to test reporting and project refactoring, I invested 2 hours on this task. As I knew from experience, good reporting helps everyone make sense of test data. I wanted to integrate Mochawesome reporter so I could present the test results nicely to the hackathon judges. I wrote a tutorial on how to do this which you can find in this post ‚Äì<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mariedrake.com/post/test-reporting-with-cypress-and-mochawesome" rel="noopener noreferrer">¬†</a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mariedrake.com/post/test-reporting-with-cypress-and-mochawesome" rel="noopener noreferrer">Test Reporting with Cypress and Mochawesome</a>. I also started noticing that my test code was getting a lot of duplication so I did some refactoring to clean up my automation framework.</p>
<h2 id="h.xfsxfxk9x2gl">The Hackathon Experience: Cypress with Applitools</h2>
<p>Now let‚Äôs look at how long it took me to do cross browser visual testing with Cypress and Applitools.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Applitools Cypress SDK: <strong>2 mins</strong></li>
<li>Setup project structure with Cypress and Applitools: <strong>10 mins</strong></li>
<li>Writing tests for version 1: <strong>20 mins</strong></li>
<li>Running tests for version 2: <strong>5 mins</strong></li>
<li>Bug reporting with Applitools: <strong>25 mins</strong></li>
<li>Documentation: <strong>10 mins</strong></li>
<li><strong>Total time: 1 hr, 12 min</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In total, I spent around just over one hour writing the tests for both version 1 and version 2 when using Cypress with Applitools. The time difference was massive! There were a few visual bugs that I missed that Applitools caught but even if this was the case, I didn‚Äôt have to rewrite my tests at all. All the adjustments were done on the Applitools Dashboard directly and marking the bugs through its annotation feature.</p>
<p>Writing the tests was considerably faster. As opposed to verifying individual selectors and checking that it‚Äôs visible, I took a screenshot of the whole page which is a better approach for visual validation.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1294" height="696" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-8.png" alt="carbon 8" class="wp-image-22988" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-8.png 1294w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-8-300x161.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-8-1024x551.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-8-768x413.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1294px) 100vw, 1294px"/></figure>
<p>Visual validation test with Cypress and Applitools</p>
<p>The code snippet above is simpler and will catch more visual bugs with less or even no test code maintenance.</p>
<p>So you might be wondering from the above code, how did I handle the cross browser capabilities? This was easily achieved by creating a file called <em>`applitools.config.js` ¬†</em>on the root of your project and specifying the list of browsers that you want your tests to execute on. By utilising Ultrafast Grid and setting my concurrency to 10, I was able to run the tests quicker too.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1346" height="876" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-9.png" alt="carbon 9" class="wp-image-22989" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-9.png 1346w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-9-300x195.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-9-1024x666.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/carbon-9-768x500.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1346px) 100vw, 1346px"/></figure>
<p>Achieving Cross Browser Visual Testing with Applitools</p>
<h2 id="h.m35xq8vyzd1a">The Impact of Visual Cross Browser Testing for Testers</h2>
<p>Overall, this was another excellent hackathon from Applitools and showed that cross browser testing can be easy and fast. I‚Äôve mentioned this in the past already that one of the trends that I‚Äôm seeing is more and more testing tools are becoming user friendly and if you are new to test automation, this is great news!</p>
<p>Also, from my experience, the production bugs that get missed most frequently are visual bugs. A test that hasn‚Äôt loaded any of its CSS files can still work functionally and your automated functional test will still pass. Rather than doing cross browser functional testing, it‚Äôs better to do cross browser visual testing to get maximum value.</p>
<p>Finally, the massive time saving that it provides means that we, as testers, have more time to explore the areas that automated tests can‚Äôt catch and that is a big win.</p>
