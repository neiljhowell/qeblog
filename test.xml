<p>Many teams struggle to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-use-metrics-measurement-drive-devops" rel="noopener noreferrer">identify the key performance indicators</a> that will demonstrate to management why DevOps matters and how it affects business results. Not having the right metrics is just one of the many <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/optimize-devops-tb/5-mistakes-doom-devops?lx=vm26kZ&amp;custom_url=optimize-devops-tb%2Fdevops-scale-software-factory&amp;amp;utm_campaign=00172440&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=techbeacon" rel="noopener noreferrer">ways that DevOps initiatives fail</a>.</p>
<p>Visualizing objective, automated metrics makes them easier to understand. That&#8217;s why choosing <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/devops-metrics-matter-how-prove-business-value" rel="noopener noreferrer">the right DevOps metrics</a> is key. Here are six that have worked for my team at IBM, why they were chosen, and the improvements seen as a result. </p>

<h3>1. Availability and uptime</h3>
<p>In the book <em><a target="_blank" href="https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/?gclid=CjwKCAjwztL2BRATEiwAvnALcrykM8BLlXoJ7tKFfTJhINzzpCjLRhZueNMjJqyHh3TV56qjfqZDjRoCi9gQAvD_BwE" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Accelerate</a></em>, by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nicolefv" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Nicole Forsgren</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jezhumble" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jez Humble</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/realgenekim" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gene Kim</a>, one of the four key software delivery metrics is &#8220;time to restore service.&#8221; Uptime is essentially a way to aggregate this metric over time.  </p>
<p>My team calculates availability by taking the total time of all outages reported by our primary production monitor for each service, subtracting that from the total time, and then dividing by the total time. </p>
<p>Our availability dashboard calculates this on demand for any date range. Most of our services have agreed to a service-level objective (SLO) of 99.95% uptime, with a few committing to 99.85% instead.</p>
<p>Our general manager reviews the uptime numbers for each of our production services quarterly. This motivates teams to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure their production monitors are accurately measuring the true end user experience</li>
<li>Focus on improving the availability of services that aren&#8217;t meeting their goals</li>
<li>Celebrate when they meet their SLO</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Work in progress</h3>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://global.toyota/en/company/vision-and-philosophy/production-system/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Toyota Production System</a> of lean manufacturing taught us that limiting work in progress (batch sizes) helps teams improve overall throughput. Put another way, it&#8217;s better to finish one project today than to chip away at 10 projects and finish none of them.</p>
<p>With our work-in-progress metric added to our dashboard, my team can simply count the number of open issues of each type (story, defect, task). When the number gets too high, it&#8217;s time to stop taking on new work and focus on what has already been started. That improves our overall velocity.</p>
<p><em>[ Learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/optimize-devops-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">the secrets of successful DevOps initiatives</a> in TechBeacon’s Guide. Plus: Get the <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/optimize-devops-tb/optimizing-devops-EMA-report?lx=vm26kZ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimizing DevOps Initiatives: Both Sides of the DevOps Divide</a> report ]</em></p>
<h3>3. Repository speed</h3>
<p>Pull requests represent value waiting to be delivered to production. The repository speed score is based on the time from submission to merge (i.e., review duration) of GitHub pull requests, over the last 30 days. A perfect score is given when the average time per pull request comes in at zero to two weekdays (M-F), decreasing to a score of zero at five weekdays.  </p>
<p>Old pull requests can get lost, affecting the repository speed metric. When you&#8217;re working with more than one repository, it&#8217;s difficult to keep track of outstanding pull requests.</p>
<p>One new feature shows where all outstanding pull requests for every repository the squad owns are shown, highlighting the ones that are old, and some squads review these in their daily stand-up. By highlighting old pull requests waiting for review, we ensure that our developers focus their code review efforts where they are needed.</p>
<p>Some developers frequently created pull requests before they were ready to deliver to production. Some of these requests stayed open for weeks, and that drove down our repository speed scores. </p>
<p>These long-running pull requests were used as a discussion point with other squads to clarify information that was missing in the specs. It was also a way for developers to communicate changes that would affect other squads.</p>
<p>Finally, this issue also highlighted a tight coupling between squads that my team wanted to avoid. The goal is for our squads to be autonomous but also loosely coupled to each other. The idea is to keep our microservice architecture very flexible, using APIs between the different services/squads. But when more than one squad began working on the same pull request, it highlighted an issue that seemed like an architecture/code ownership problem to us. If your APIs are well designed, you should be able to make changes at will, without affecting other squads.</p>
<p>After discussing best practices to improve this metric, squads were driven to experiment with pair programming, development on branches, API versioning, and contributing code across repositories.</p>
<h3>4. Deployment frequency</h3>
<p>Squads that deploy more than once per week can fix outages in production faster because they have the automation in place to deploy changes quickly and easily. They&#8217;re also delivering value to customers more frequently.</p>
<p>Finally, they&#8217;re more likely to fix newly reported critical security vulnerabilities within a few days because they don&#8217;t have to wait for the next scheduled deployment window or implement an &#8220;emergency change&#8221; procedure.</p>
<p>Our deployment frequency score is based on the number of successful deployments over the last 30 days, with color zero to one deployments red, two to three yellow, and four or more green.</p>
<p>Initially my team received pushback from teams that deliver code to production only every couple of weeks or, in some cases, only once per month. Deployment frequency is a key metric, and we were able to use the research from <em>Accelerate</em> to back up the importance of frequent deployments.  </p>
<h4>Promoting more frequent deployments</h4>
<p>To further encourage frequent deployments, teams were put on a weekly sprint cadence. And early on, we also had weekly playbacks. It quickly became clear which teams were delivering value every week and which were not. </p>
<p>Eventually, as the organization grew, my team settled into a pattern of biweekly playbacks so they could fit half of the teams each week into a one-hour session.</p>
<p>All of this led to conversations about how these teams might <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-deliver-speed-without-losing-your-customers" rel="noopener noreferrer">adopt continuous delivery</a>. In some cases, we&#8217;ve been able to sit with a team and get its CI/CD pipeline set up within a few days.</p>
<p>A red deployment frequency tile also shows us where the team needs to pull down the latest code and check for security vulnerabilities, and hopefully <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/how-automation-can-boost-your-security-compliance" rel="noopener noreferrer">automate that process</a> as well.</p>
<h3>5. Deployment stability</h3>
<p>Deployment stability is the percentage of time when the most recent build for a given repository was successful. On our scale, 0% to 50% is red, 50% to 90% is yellow, and 90% or higher is green. A developer on our team invented this metric after our developers complained that they were spending too much of their time fixing builds. </p>
<p>Broken builds can be a good thing, when <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-build-agile-friendly-test-automation-framework" rel="noopener noreferrer">excellent test automation</a> has stopped a poor-quality change from being delivered to production. Not all broken builds are due to code errors; sometimes there&#8217;s an infrastructure problem that needs to be fixed. Broken builds become a problem when they persist for a long time and start to interfere with developer productivity.</p>
<p>By visualizing broken builds over time on the dashboard, it&#8217;s obvious where squads need to spend some time <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/drowning-technical-debt-worse-youre-trapped-ponzi-scheme" rel="noopener noreferrer">cleaning up technical debt</a> and fixing the deployment process.</p>
<h3>6. SonarQube metrics</h3>
<p>Most of our repositories have integrated <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sonarqube.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SonarQube</a> reporting into their CI/CD processes, pulling the overall scores for security, code quality, and test coverage into our dashboard. They&#8217;re displayed at a repository level, squad level, and cross-platform level. </p>
<p>Making these scores visible helps teams ask for more time to improve their scores. My team has seen, for example, that one team improved its SonarQube security score from a D to an A in two days just by implementing the small changes SonarQube recommended.</p>
<p>My team is frequently challenged to defend our goal of 100% unit test coverage. Some teams believe they should get an &#8220;A&#8221; on the dashboard for a lower test coverage score, like 70%. My team stuck to our convictions here, and if a squad is happy with 70% coverage, then they can accept a lower grade.  </p>
<p>Others point out that it&#8217;s possible for teams to game the system by telling the code coverage checker to ignore large swathes of code. In reality, there has not been widespread abuse of code coverage &#8220;ignore&#8221; flags. Our developers and code reviewers should have the integrity to be honest about their code coverage.</p>
<h3>Understand your goal—and start slow</h3>
<p>Your goal should not be to make every tile on the dashboard turn green. You want to see where your squad is performing well and where there&#8217;s room to improve. Then you can make an informed decision as to where to invest time.</p>
<p>These six metrics are simple for people to visualize, and they have resulted in positive changes in my organization. But start out small and roll them out gradually as you explore how these metrics can help your own organization.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Let’s start with the good news. Agencies are adopting cloud services at an increased rate. Adoption has only increased in]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>Let’s start with the good news. Agencies are adopting cloud services at an increased rate. Adoption has only increased in times of coronavirus quarantine lockdowns with most federal, state and municipal workforce working from home. What’s even better news is that we also see increased adoption of cloud security tools, like CASB, which is commensurate with the expanding cloud footprint of US Public Sector agencies.</p>
<p>So now we have security tools in place to secure our cloud assets in SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. The next step is to determine what security controls need to be implemented. What DLP policies should the agency adopt? What capabilities of a cloud services should be enabled or disabled to maintain a robust security posture? How does an agency actually go about measuring the effectiveness of the security controls that were implemented? How do we find out how we stack up against our peer organizations?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, McAfee developed MVISION Cloud Security Advisor (CSA). Cloud Security Advisor is a portal that is provided “out-of-the-box” with your organization’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products/mvision-cloud.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">MVISION Cloud</a> CASB tenant. CSA provides a comprehensive set of recommendations for organizations to prioritize efforts in implementing their cloud security controls. The recommendations are broken down into Visibility and Control metrics. There is also a section that provides quarterly reports on various parameters, which we will discuss in a little bit.</p>
<p>When you first access Cloud Security Advisor dashboard you are presented with a “magic quadrant” that shows your organization’s security posture relative to other peer organizations on the scales of <strong>Control</strong> and <strong>Visibility</strong> and provides a <strong>maturity score</strong> for both.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-101805 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-1.png" alt="" width="936" height="472" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-1.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-1-300x151.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-1-768x387.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-1-205x103.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>There is even an option to select a vertical market to see how your organizations stacks up to organizations in other business sectors.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-101806 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-1.png" alt="" width="450" height="314" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-1.png 450w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-1-300x209.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-1-185x129.png 185w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"/></p>
<p>On the right of the main dashboard are check list items that provide a short description and current progress in following Cloud Security Advisor’s recommendations. CSA scans the organization’s MISION Cloud environment once every 24 hours. Any changes to MVISION Cloud will be reflected in the next scan. In the screenshot below, for example, we see an environment that is not enforcing controls on publicly shared links in Collaboration SaaS apps.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101807 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-1.png" alt="" width="936" height="404" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-1.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-1-300x129.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-1-768x331.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-1-205x88.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>From here, a security admin can simply click on the check list item and then on <strong>Enable Policy</strong>. This will automatically take the user to the DLP Policy Templates page to select the appropriate policy for enforcement.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101808 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1.png" alt="" width="936" height="472" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1-300x151.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1-768x387.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1-205x103.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>Another powerful capability of MVISION Cloud Security Advisor is providing quarterly Cloud Security Reports. These are accessible from the main CSA dashboard by going to <strong>View Reports </strong>and then selecting a quarter for which you would like to see the report.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101809 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5.png" alt="" width="936" height="274" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-300x88.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-768x225.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-205x60.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>From there we can start examining our organization’s cloud footprint to identify total number of Shadow IT services discovered that quarter as well as some additional Shadow IT statistics.</p>

<p>Next we can look at IaaS resources in all our AWS, Azure and GCP environments.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101811 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7.png" alt="" width="936" height="318" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-300x102.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-768x261.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-205x70.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>We then proceed to look at summary statistics for DLP and access policy violations. Incidents show policy violations of each type detected across all of the organization’s cloud environments secured by MVISION Cloud CASB.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101812 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8.png" alt="" width="936" height="370" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-300x119.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-768x304.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-205x81.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>Next screen shows user behavioral anomalies and threats uncovered by MVISION Cloud UBA machine-learning engine.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101813 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.png" alt="" width="936" height="322" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-300x103.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-768x264.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-205x71.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>The Malware section of the report provides insights into malware uncovered in SaaS and IaaS environments connected to MVISION Cloud.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101814 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10.png" alt="" width="936" height="304" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10-300x97.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10-768x249.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10-205x67.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>The Data at Risk report is probably the most pertinent to gauging the effectiveness of the MVISION Cloud CASB solution. This report shows how much of the organization’s data was at risk and how it was secured using MVISION Cloud CASB. As seen from the image, there is a downward trend, indicating progress is being made to secure organization’s data. <img class="wp-image-101815 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/11.png" alt="" width="936" height="426" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/11.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/11-300x137.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/11-768x350.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/11-205x93.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>The Sensitive Data report shows how organization’s sensitive data is distributed across all cloud services in use by the organization. This report also provides insights into cloud adoption trends for your organization.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101816 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12.png" alt="" width="936" height="472" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12-300x151.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12-768x387.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12-205x103.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>The “Users” report is a pivot table of the Sensitive Data report that organizes incidents and policy violations by individual users. Ultimately, the report shows how much of a risk an organization’s users pose to organization’s data. <img class="wp-image-101817 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/13.png" alt="" width="936" height="388" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/13.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/13-300x124.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/13-768x318.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/13-205x85.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>The Mobile Devices report shows incidents for each type of detected mobile device.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101818 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/14.png" alt="" width="936" height="352" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/14.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/14-300x113.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/14-768x289.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/14-205x77.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>The next three pages of the CSA report provide a deeper dive into the data on the front page of the CSA portal we saw in the beginning of this blog. On the <strong>Scores</strong> page we see the “magic quadrant” with <strong>Control</strong> and <strong>Visibility </strong>axis, together with progress relative to previous quarters. Visibility score and Control score, both on a scale of 100, gauge your organization’s maturity in securing its cloud footprint. <img class="wp-image-101819 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15.png" alt="" width="936" height="666" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15-300x213.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15-768x546.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15-181x129.png 181w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>Next, the Visibility metrics page. Visibility metrics measure how well an organization has been doing in gaining visibility into what is out there in their cloud environment and how secure it is.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-101820 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/16.png" alt="" width="936" height="740" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/16.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/16-300x237.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/16-768x607.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/16-163x129.png 163w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>Finally, the Control metrics page shows how well an organization has performed in placing controls and mitigating security risks for its cloud environment.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-101821 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/17.png" alt="" width="936" height="472" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/17.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/17-300x151.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/17-768x387.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/17-205x103.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>And that, in a nutshell, is it. By reviewing the screenshots from the Cloud Security Advisor dashboard you should now have a good idea of the metrics at your disposal to quantify cloud security effectiveness for your organization.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>In less than a week, the world changed. At the end of March, amid the throes of the coronavirus pandemic, the vast majority of states in the US issued stay-at-home orders, resulting in the largest migration to remote working the nation has ever seen.</p>
<p>Before this happened, just <a target="_blank" href="https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">4% of workers spent the majority of their working hours outside the office</a>, and only 43% worked remotely with &#8220;some frequency.&#8221;</p>
<p>For security teams, the move caused chaos. Sensitive business resources that had, up to that point, only been accessed by workers at the office now had to be available to employees working from home. While many security experts had talked about the decline of the perimeter for more than a decade, the mass migration to remote working has forced every business to consider <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/pandemic-your-remote-workforce-9-ways-stay-secure" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to operate security with a distributed workforce</a>.</p>
<p>Many still are struggling to adjust, said Chase Cunningham, vice president and principal analyst for security and risk at Forrester Research.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen five years of innovation in three months. Companies are going to move toward this model, and it is up to them whether they work towards it now or continue to skate uphill by keeping everything inside the network.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/CynjaChaseC" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Chase Cunningham</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Zero trust,&#8221; the concept of operating securely with a distributed workforce and without a perimeter, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/how-zero-trust-approach-can-protect-your-cloud-resources" rel="noopener noreferrer">has become a necessity for most companies</a>. Not long ago, it was an aspirational model instead of a requirement.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/zero-trust-identity-access-management-tb/security-architecture-changes?lx=9nmHuO&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">why zero trust is so important now</a>, and how you can implement the model.</p>
<p><em>[ <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/zero-trust-security-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get up to speed on zero trust security</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s guide. Plus: Learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/zero-trust-identity-access-management-tb/conquering-the-authe?lx=9nmHuO&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to conquer zero trust authentication challenges</a> in this Webinar. ]</em></p>
<h3>Why zero trust is needed</h3>
<p>Surveys have found that anywhere from 70% to 85% of companies with remote workers intend to encourage them to continue to work from home even after stay-at-home orders expire. For instance, business research firm Gartner <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-04-03-gartner-cfo-survey-reveals-74-percent-of-orgs-to-shift-some-employees-to-remote-work-permanently" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">found that 74% of companies expect at least 5%</a> of their workforce who previously worked in an office to work from home in the future.</p>
<p>Still, the zero-trust model is not just about accommodating those workers. It is a <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-pandemic?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">foundational move in the digital transformation of the business</a>—efforts that were already underway before the pandemic, said Robert MacDonald, director of solutions at Micro Focus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The situation has accelerated the need to digitally transform the business to remove the traditional perimeter to be much more fluid, because people are working from everywhere, and they need access to that data regardless.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/macdonaldrobert/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Robert MacDonald</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For companies struggling with <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/key-bulletproof-security-zero-trust-networks" rel="noopener noreferrer">moving to the zero-trust model</a>, here are five recommendations from experts.</p>
<h3>1. Zero trust is no longer optional</h3>
<p>Moving the focus of security away from the perimeter is no longer an option. Aside from the realities imposed by the coronavirus pandemic and the uncertainty of whether in-office work will be possible on a consistent basis, many companies are looking at moving employees out of the office as a way to cut costs, reduce downtime due to commuting, and improve employees&#8217; work-life balance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been having lots of conversations about companies reducing how many people are coming to an office in a building,&#8221; Forrester&#8217;s Cunningham said. If they can cut their on-premises workforce by 25%, they can reduce costs significantly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;This is one of the few times in history where something that is really terrible can have a massive upside if we leverage carefully.&#8221;<br />—Chase Cunningham</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>[ Learn about <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/zero-trust-identity-access-management-tb/evolution-of-trusted-identities?lx=9nmHuO&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">the evolution of trusted identities</a> in this zero trust Webinar. ]</em></p>
<h3>2. Much of the technology is new</h3>
<p>Even just a few years ago, mature technology for implementing zero trust did not exist. While single sign-on vendors existed, the ability to manage corporate resources and access to those resources on a granular level had not advanced enough to scale to large deployments.</p>
<p>The US Department of Defense and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fedscoop.com/government-agency-embrace-identity-access-strengthen-cybersecurity-study/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">other federal agencies have pursued zero-trust principles</a> for more than a decade, with a variety of programs aimed at limiting access to data to only authorized parties, according to <a target="_blank" href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207-draft2.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a draft zero-trust architecture specification</a> from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p>
<p>When these programs were started, &#8220;they were limited by the technical capabilities of information systems,&#8221; NIST said in the draft. Security policies were largely static and, to get the largest effect for the effort, were enforced at large &#8220;choke points&#8221; that an enterprise could control.</p>
<p>As technology matures, it is becoming possible to continually analyze and evaluate access requests, dynamically and granularly, &#8220;to mitigate data exposure due to compromised accounts, attackers monitoring a network, and other threats,&#8221; the NIST document said.</p>
<h3>3. Don&#8217;t expect a single service or product to solve the problem</h3>
<p>Zero trust requires a large number of components to work together in an auditable and verifiable way. The seven basic tenets, according to the NIST specification, include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Designating all data sources and computing services as resources</li>
<li>Encrypting all communication end-to-end, no matter the location</li>
<li>Authorizing access to resources on a per-session basis</li>
<li>Allowing security and access policies to dynamically change based on context, state of the client, and current perceived risk </li>
<li>Monitoring all assets to be in the most secure state possible</li>
<li>Enforcing the temporary and dynamic nature of authentication and authorization</li>
<li>Maintaining visibility into the security of the entire network and business&#8217;s resources</li>
</ol>
<p>The interaction among all these requirements means that a single product or service is not going to be able to deliver a zero-trust architecture to a company, said Micro Focus&#8217;s MacDonald. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If a single company is saying that they will get you to zero trust, that&#8217;s nonsense.&#8221;<br />—Robert MacDonald</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>4. Identity and access management are crucial starting points</h3>
<p>The root cause of many breaches is the use of stolen credentials; it&#8217;s the second-most common threat action, <a target="_blank" href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/2020-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">according to Verizon&#8217;s 2020 Data Breach Investigations Report</a>. The most common threat action is phishing, which often also leads to credential compromise.</p>
<p>Almost every company that has suffered a breach has had antivirus software, a firewall, and maybe even an intrusion-prevention system in place, said Forrester&#8217;s Cunningham. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Where they fell down was with privilege and access control. If your identity or access store is compromised, that is when a breach can go on for days.&#8221;<br />—Chase Cunningham</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lesson is that managing identity and access is possibly the most important part of security, especially in a world of distributed employees, he said. </p>
<h3>5. Verify identity and authorization continuously</h3>
<p>Managing the initial authentication is not enough. Companies also need to re-authenticate users every time they access a different resource. With <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/state-authentication-its-time-move-passwords" rel="noopener noreferrer">technologies including adaptive authentication</a>, such checks do not have to be intrusive, but should be based on context, said Micro Focus&#8217; MacDonald.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If you only rely on the point of access, there is no check afterward. You want to constantly verify that the user assigned that identity is doing what you think they should be doing. If we just let them in and let them go, then we lose visibility into what actions they are taking on the network.&#8221;<br />—Robert MacDonald</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As companies adjust to &#8220;the new reality,&#8221; security remains a tough balance. However, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/toward-zero-trust-8-steps-boost-app-sec" rel="noopener noreferrer">pursuing a zero-trust architecture</a> can give companies flexibility in work arrangements, the security of continuous monitoring, and the ability to adapt to whatever the future holds.</p>

</p>
<div>
<p>In today’s online world, every digital experience is a reflection of your brand—which is why mobile application testing should be at the forefront of your testing strategy. </p>
<p>Whether it’s a picture of a check, a selfie, or a QR code, images can be uploaded to mobile apps for many reasons. Behind the scenes, the application has to do some amount of processing and storage. While creating those images might have been as simple as pointing and clicking for the user, testing image uploads themselves can be more challenging.</p>
<p>Before we dive into how to test image upload functionality, let’s quickly look at some common scenarios that require this type of testing.</p>
<h3><b>Common Use Cases</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/7JhrCi0CYMPZtsgoEVvipz/c98ccfed3daeb607652c09360bf71f23/QR_img2.png?fm=webp" alt="Scannable QR code" title="Scannable QR code"/></p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/2MwxZplM37IR0TqHvjJYmA/b58a137fec1cb9b068ff9816175d350f/Profile_img3.png?fm=webp" alt="Sample profile picture" title="Sample profile picture"/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Taking a picture and storing it in a gallery app</b> &#8211; Whether it’s a social media app or photo sharing, this use case can span many different types. In its simplest form, it could be taking pictures from the front or back cameras.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/6xXQBWV6M79mAPNpkYh8K4/675f2220aaeef0cc1dcf7a58f05f324b/Gallery_img4.png?fm=webp" alt="Sample image gallery" title="Sample image gallery"/></p>
<p>Regardless of the application, in order to ensure end users have a delightful experience, development teams need to have the ability to use the device camera for taking pictures so they can complete all testing scenarios. If you’re using a cloud service for mobile app testing, the devices will need to offer some type of Camera Image Injection feature.</p>
<h3><b>What is Camera Image Injection?</b></h3>
<p>Camera image injection gives developers the ability to inject images in their automation testing, so that specific test cases such as apps requiring scanning of QR codes or image scanners, can run on a cloud-based testing service as if it were on an actual device. This essentially provides the application with an image that mocks the use of the device camera. </p>
<h3><b>Testing on Sauce Labs Real Device Cloud</b></h3>
<p>To mimic camera behavior when testing applications on the <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/platform/real-device-cloud" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Device Cloud</a>, you need to provide the application with an image that mocks the use of the camera. Sauce enables this with the Camera Image Injection feature. Image injection takes an image (in either .<i>jpeg</i>, or .<i>jpg</i> format) that is stored locally and presents it to the application as if it was read by the device camera. Users can easily test this functionality manually via live testing or insert into their Appium test automation.</p>
<h4>Live Testing</h4>
<p>In this short video, you can see the uploaded image is used in the app as if the image was taken by the device camera.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/6TIA8Xe7et6hCLTrmcU3eP/9fa96acb4786786022db33c25b9f85ec/image-injection-steps-3-fast.gif" alt="Short video illustrating the steps to image injection" title="Short video illustrating the steps to image injection"/></p>
<h4>Appium Test Automation</h4>
<p>In your automated test script, you&#8217;ll need to input the desired capabilities specific to Camera Image Injection (<a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=102717708" rel="noopener noreferrer">see example code snippets here</a>) and incorporate the uploading of the images and opening of the camera.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start image injection by adding camera instrumentation desired capability command in your test script. Image injection is enabled by the desired capability sauceLabsImageInjectionEnabled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you reach the stage in your test session where you’d like to take an image with the app camera, add the image injection method in your test script. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After inputting this code, the application reads the image when it captures a photo. You can change the image by sending the custom command with a different image.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For further instructions on how to setup image injection in your account, check out our <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=102717708" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a>.

            </div>
<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The RagnarLocker ransomware first appeared in the wild at the end of December 2019 as part of a campaign against compromised networks targeted by its operators.</p>
<p>The ransomware code is small (only 48kb after the protection in its custom packer is removed) and coded in a high programming language (C/C++). Like all ransomware, the<strong> goal of this malware is to encrypt all files that it can and request a ransom for decrypting them.</strong></p>
<p>RagnarLocker’s operators, as we have seen with other bad actors recently, threaten to publish the information they get from compromised machines if ransoms are not paid.</p>
<p>After conducting reconnaissance, the ransomware operators enter the victim’s network and, in some pre-deployment stages, steal information before finally dropping the ransomware that will encrypt all files in the victim’s machines.</p>
<p>The most notable RagnarLocker attack to date saw this malware deployed in a large company where the malware operators then requested a ransom of close to $11 million USD in return for not leaking information stolen from the company. In this report we will talk about the sample used in this attack.</p>
<p>At the time of writing there are no free decryptors for RagnarLocker.</p>
<p><strong>However, certain McAfee products, including personal antivirus, endpoint, and gateway can protect our customers against the threats that we talk about in this report.</strong></p>
<h2>RAGNARLOCKER OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>The unpacked malware is a binary file of 32 bits that can be found as an EXE file.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101743" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-1.png" alt="" width="518" height="259" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-1.png 518w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-1-300x150.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-1-205x103.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 1. INFORMATION ABOUT THE MALWARE</p>
<p>As can be seen in the previous screenshot, this sample was compiled on the 6th of April 2020. The attack mentioned earlier took place some days later, but this sample was prepared for the victim, as we will explain later.</p>

<h2>TECHNICAL DETAILS</h2>
<p>As we often see with ransomware, RagnarLocker starts preparing some strings of languages for the CIS countries that are embedded within its own code (in Unicode).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101744" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-2.png" alt="" width="523" height="183" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-2.png 523w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-2-300x105.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-2-205x72.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 2. THE LANGUAGE STRINGS EMBEDDED INTO THE CODE IN THE STACK</p>
<p>The languages that are hardcoded are:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Georgian</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Russian</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ukrainian</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Moldavian</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Belorussian</td>

<tr>
<td>Azerbaijani</td>

<tr>
<td>Turkmen</td>

<tr>
<td>Kazakh</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Uzbek</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tajik</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>After preparing these strings, the malware uses the function “GetLocaleInfoW” to get the LOCALE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT language as a string. Once obtained, it will check the system language with the blacklisted languages and, if any of them match, it will terminate itself with the function “TerminateProcess” and with an error result code of 0x29A (as we have seen before with many different malware samples).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101748" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-3.png" alt="" width="1382" height="521" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-3.png 1382w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-3-300x113.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-3-1024x386.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-3-768x290.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-3-205x77.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 1382px) 100vw, 1382px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 3. CHECK OF THE LANGUAGE AGAINST THE BLACKLIST</p>
<p>The check against the LOCALE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT is to prevent a user from installing a language they would not otherwise use as a means of avoiding infection. The check is made against the language selected in Windows. Of course, not everyone in these countries will be using a CIS language in Windows so English is also ok to use. As with other ransomware families, there is no guarantee that infection will be avoided if other languages are selected as the default.</p>
<p>After this the malware will get the name of the infected computer with the function “GetComputerNameW” and the username of whoever is actively using the machine at that time with the function “GetUserNameW”.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101749" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-4.png" alt="" width="817" height="391" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-4.png 817w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-4-300x144.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-4-768x368.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-4-205x98.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 4. GET THE COMPUTER NAME AND THE USERNAME</p>
<p>After this the malware will read two registry keys:</p>
<ul>
<li>HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftCryptography and the subkey MachineGuid to get the GUID of the victim machine.</li>
<li>HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersion and the subkey “ProductName” to get the name of the operating system.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this the malware uses the functions “RegOpenKeyExW”, “RegQueryValueExW” and “RegCloseKey” in the hive HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. This hive can be read without admin rights.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101750" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-5.png" alt="" width="969" height="517" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-5.png 969w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-5-300x160.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-5-768x410.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-5-205x109.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 969px) 100vw, 969px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 5. READ FROM THE REGISTRY THE NAME OF OPERATING SYSTEM AND GUID</p>
<p>Next, RagnarLocker will prepare the first string in the stack with the function “lstrcpyW” and later will start joining the strings with the function “lstrcatW”.</p>
<p>The sequence is first the GUID of the machine, then the Windows operating system name, the user logged in the machine and, finally, the name of the victim machine.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101751" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-6.png" alt="" width="772" height="499" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-6.png 772w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-6-300x194.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-6-768x496.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-6-200x129.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 6. GET INFORMATION OF THE USER AND MACHINE AND JOIN ALL STRINGS</p>
<p>In the screenshot some values were modified to protect my virtual machine. After getting this information and preparing the string, the malware makes a custom hash with each.</p>
<p>For this, the malware will reserve some memory with “VirtualAlloc” and get the size of the string and compute the hash in a very small loop. After this it will format the hash with the function “wsprintfW” to have it as a Unicode string.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101752" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-7.png" alt="" width="1089" height="378" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-7.png 1089w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-7-300x104.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-7-1024x355.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-7-768x267.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-7-205x71.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 1089px) 100vw, 1089px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 7. MAKE THE CUSTOM HASH AND FORMAT AS UNICODE STRING</p>
<p>The hashes are made in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Machine name (g. 0xf843256f*)</li>
<li>Name of the user logged into the machine (e.g. 0x56ef3218*)</li>
<li>GUID of the infected machine (e.g. 0x78ef216f*)</li>
<li>Name of the operating system (e.g. 0x91fffe45*)</li>
<li>Finally, the full string with all strings joined (e.g. 0xe35d68fe*)</li>
</ul>
<p>*The above values have been changed to protect my machine.</p>
<p>After this it will use the function “wsprintfW”, with the template string “%s-%s-%s-%s-%s”, to format the custom hashes together with hyphens between them, but in this case the hashes are in this order:</p>
<ul>
<li>GUID</li>
<li>Operating System Name</li>
<li>Name of the logged in user</li>
<li>Name of the infected machine</li>
<li>Full string with all other strings joined together</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101753" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-8.png" alt="" width="892" height="485" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-8.png 892w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-8-300x163.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-8-768x418.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-8-205x111.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 892px) 100vw, 892px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 8. CREATE CUSTOM HASH OF THE STRINGS AND FORMAT THE FINAL STRING IN A SPECIAL ORDER</p>
<p>The malware will get the command line of this launch process and will check if it has more than one argument (the first argument is always in C/C++) with the functions “GetCommandLineW”, to get the full command line with arguments if it exists, and “CommandLineToArgvW” to get the arguments if they exist.</p>
<p>If there is more than one argument the malware will avoid the next procedure. To keep the normal flow in the technical details section we will put what happens if only one argument exists. In this case the malware will try to make a Windows Event with the name of the formatted string with all hashes, as explained earlier (in our example case above, 78ef216f-91fffe45-56ef3218-f843256f-e35d68fe).</p>
<p>After trying to create the event the malware will check the last error with the function “GetLastError” and compare with ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS (0xB7). If the event already exists the malware will check a counter with the value at 0x8000 (32768) and, if is not this value, it will increase the counter by one and try again to make the event, check the last error, and so on, until it can finally make the event, reach the counter value, or it reaches the maximum value in the counter (64233). If the event cannot be created the malware will get the pseudohandle to its own process with the function “GetCurrentProcess” and terminate it with the function “TerminateProcess” with the exit code 0x29A.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101754" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-9.png" alt="" width="902" height="515" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-9.png 902w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-9-300x171.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-9-768x438.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-9-205x117.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 9. CREATE EVENT LOOP AFTER CHECKING THERE IS ONLY ONE ARGUMENT IN THE COMMAND LINE</p>
<p>This is done for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The event is created to avoid relaunching another instance of the malware at the same time.</li>
<li>The check of the counter is made if another instance of the malware is launched, to wait for the previous one to finish before continuing the process (this avoids some issues with the malware checking for crypted files).</li>
<li>The check of the argument, as we will explain later, can be used to avoid the event behavior so the malware will always try to encrypt files. It is one of the reasons why a vaccine against this malware is useless if the malware operator executes the malware with an argument as simple as “1”.</li>
</ul>
<p>After this, the malware will try to access in raw mode all units connected to the victim machine in a physical way, preparing the string “\.PHYSICALDRIVE%d”. This string will be formatted with the function “wsprintfW”, starting with the first unit that is 0 to a maximum of 16 in a loop. After the format, the malware will use “CreateFileW” and check that it does not return the error “ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE” (that means the unit cannot be accessed or that it does not exist). If this error is returned it will increase the counter and format the string with the new value of the counter. If it can open the handle to the unit in raw mode it will send two commands using the function “DeviceIoControl”.</p>
<p>The commands are:</p>
<ul>
<li>0x7C0F4 -&gt; IOCTL_DISK_SET_DISK_ATTRIBUTES with the attributes of: DISK_ATTRIBUTE_READ_ONLY and DISK_ATTRIBUTE_OFFLINE.</li>

<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 10. CONTROL THE PHYSICAL DISK TO HAVE ACCESS TO IT</p>
<p>The ransomware’s next action is checking the units that exist and can be accessed without any problem. This can be done in two ways, the first of which is using the functions “FindFirstVolumeA”, “FindNextVolumeA” and “FindVolumeClose”.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101756" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-11.png" alt="" width="1226" height="402" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-11.png 1226w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-11-300x98.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-11-1024x336.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-11-768x252.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-11-205x67.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 1226px) 100vw, 1226px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 11. GET VOLUME LETTER AND INFORMATION TO CHECK IT EXISTS AND CAN BE ACCESSED</p>
<p>The first two functions return the volume and the special internal value associated with it. This information comes from Windows, so the malware needs to translate it to the logic unit letter associated to this volume. This is done with the function “GetVolumePathNamesForVolumeNameA” that will return the logic letter associated to the volume inspected.</p>
<p>With this letter the function “GetVolumeInformationA” is then used to get information of the volume if it exists and is enabled. If the volume does not exist or cannot be checked the function will fail and the volume ignored, and the process will move onto the next volume in the machine.</p>
<p>Another check is made using the function “GetLogicalDrives” that will return a structure and, by checking one byte, the malware will know if the unit exists or not.</p>
<p>After this, the malware will prepare the keys that later will be needed to encrypt the files. To make them it will get the crypto context with the function “CryptAquireContextW” that will generate random data with “CryptGenRandom” and prepare to permutate this value with the SHA-512 algorithm. These values are the key and nonce of the Salsa20 algorithm that will be used later to encrypt files.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 12. AQUIRE CRYPTO CONTEXT AND GENERATE SOME DATA AND PREPARE WITH SHA-512</p>
<p>The malware continues decrypting some strings using two steps, one in a big function for the first layer and the other that is used later for the second layer and the final string of the service. The services stopped are:</p>

<p>Please note: The services list can change between samples.</p>
<p>After decrypting the strings, the malware accesses the SCManager with the function “OpenSCManagerA”. If it does not want access it will ignore all services and continue onto the next step.</p>
<p>If it can open a handle to it, it will get the status of the service with the function “EnumServicesStatusA” and if the service is stopped already will pass to the next one. The malware calls this function two times, firstly to get the correct size needed for this function, with the last error being checked with ¨GetLastError¨ against the value 0xEA (ERROR_MORE_DATA) (that means that the application needs more memory to fill all information than the function gives).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 13. OPEN THE SERVICE MANAGER AND ENUMSERVICESTATUS</p>
<p>This memory is reserved and the function called again later, in this case to get the real status and, if not stopped, the malware will open the service with the function “OpenServiceA” and query the status of the service with the function “QueryServiceStatusEx”. If the service is not stopped, it will get all dependencies of the service with “EnumDependentServicesA” and finally it will control the service to stop it with the function “ControlService”.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 14. OPEN THE SERVICES AND CONTROL THEM</p>
<p>After this, the malware decrypts a list of the processes that it will try terminating if it finds them in the infected machine. For this decryption, the malware uses a string that converts into an integer and uses this integer as a critical value to decrypt the list.</p>
<p>For this task, the malware will create a snapshot of all processes in the system per this blacklist:</p>

<p>Please note: The processes list can change between samples.</p>
<p>After making the snapshot it will enumerate all processes with the functions “Process32FirstW” and “Process32NextW” and for each process found will call the function “WideCharToMultyByte” to get the size needed to convert the name of the process returned in Unicode into Ascii. Later it reserves memory for the name and calls the same function to make the string conversion.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 15. GET ALL SYSTEM PROCESSES</p>
<p>If the malware, after comparison with the function “StrStrIA”, detects some of the blacklisted processes it will open the process with the function “OpenProcess” and terminate it with the function “TerminateProcess” and with the exit  code of 0x29A.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101762" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-16.png" alt="" width="991" height="438" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-16.png 991w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-16-300x133.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-16-768x339.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-16-205x91.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 100vw, 991px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 16. OPEN THE PROCESS AND TERMINATE IT IF IT IS BLACKLISTED</p>
<p>The malware will check for all processes in the blacklist, using part of the string rather than the exact name. Not using the extension allows for greater obfuscation but carries the risk that some processes could be closed by accident if they share that string.</p>
<p>After this the malware will check if the operating system is 64-bit or not with the function “GetNativeSystemInfo” against the value 9 (that means that the OS is 64-bit).</p>
<p>If the operating system is 64-bit it will get, using “LoadLibraryW” and “GetProcAddress”, the function “Woe64EnableWow64FsRedirection” to remove the redirection that by default is found in 64-bit operating systems. This call is done in a dynamic way, but the malware does not check that the function was retrieved with success; usually it will be, but it is not 100% certain and a crash calling a null pointer could ensue.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-101763 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-17.png" alt="" width="1078" height="600" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-17.png 1078w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-17-300x167.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-17-1024x570.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-17-768x427.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-17-205x114.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 17. CHECK THE OPERATING SYSTEM AND DISABLE REDIRECTION IF NEEDED</p>
<p>After this, the malware will prepare a string in Unicode embedded in the code with the string “wmic.exe shadowcopy delete” and will call it with the function “CreateProcessW”. After the call it will wait for up to an infinite amount of time using the function “WaitForSingleObject” so that the “wmic.exe” process can finish, irrespective of the size and number of shadow volumes, available machine resources, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, the malware will also use the typical program of “vssadmin” to delete the shadow volumes with the command “vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet”, as well as with the function “CreateProcessW”. After that it will wait again with “WaitForSingleObject” for the end of the new process.</p>
<p>When it finishes, the malware will check again if the operating system is 64-bit and, if it is, will use “LoadLibraryW” and “GetProcAddress” to get the function “Wo64EnableWow64FsRedirection” to leave the system as before with the redirection. Again, the malware does not check that the function is resolved with success and calls it directly in a dynamic way.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 18. DESTROY THE SHADOW VOLUMES AND RE-ENABLE THE REDIRECTION</p>
<p>While it seems like a mistake to destroy the shadow volumes again, it is not, as RagnarLocker has support for Windows XP and the WMIC classes do not exist in that operating system, hence the need to use the old program “vssadmin” that exists in both new and old operating systems.</p>
<p>The malware continues with the decryption of one PEM block encoded in base64 and the ransom note is prepared for the target in memory.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101765" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-19.png" alt="" width="1018" height="228" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-19.png 1018w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-19-300x67.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-19-768x172.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-19-205x46.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 1018px) 100vw, 1018px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 19. DECRYPTION OF THE PEM BLOCK AND THE RANSOM NOTE</p>
<p>An example of the ransom note, with confidential information removed, can be seen below:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101766" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-20.png" alt="" width="520" height="402" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-20.png 520w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-20-300x232.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-20-167x129.png 167w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 20. EXAMPLE REDACTED RANSOM NOTE</p>
<p>After preparing both things the malware decodes the PEM block from the base64 as an object, getting a key that will be used to protect the keys used in the crypto process (of course this procedure may change in future samples as the malware evolves) of the RSA algorithm. It is important to note here that this RSA key changes per sample.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101767" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-21.png" alt="" width="707" height="559" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-21.png 707w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-21-300x237.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-21-163x129.png 163w" sizes="(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 21. DECODE FROM BASE64 AND DECODE THE OBJECT AND IMPORT IT TO USE LATER</p>
<p>With this key it will encrypt the two random keys previously generated to protect them in memory. After that, the crypto will release the memory.</p>
<p>Later, it will get the name of the infected machine again, get the size of the name and will calculate the custom hash with the same algorithm as before.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 22. CRYPT THE PREVIOUSLY GENERATED VALUES AND GET THE COMPUTER NAME</p>
<p>With this hash it will prepare a string with this structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>RGNR_</li>
<li>hash from the name of the victim machine</li>
<li>the extension .txt</li>
<li>a backslash character at the start of the string</li>

<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 23. CREATION OF THE RANSOM NOTE NAME</p>
<p>With this string it will get the folder of “My Documents” for all users with the function “SHGetSpecialFolderPathW” (this function, based on the operating system, will get different paths for the documents). This string with the path of the folders will join with the string of the ransom note name and later make the final path to create the file.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 24. GET THE DOCUMENTS FOLDER TO LATER WRITE THE RANSOM NOTE</p>
<p>After this it will encode in base64 the critical information to decrypt the files with the function “CryptBinaryToStringA”. The malware uses the function the first time to get the size needed and reserve memory and then uses it again to encode the data. After encoding the data, it creates the ransom note file in the documents path with the string previously joined with the path with the function “CreateFileW” and will write the contents of the ransom note that has been prepared in memory. Later, it will format a special string with some hardcoded characters with “—RAGNAR SECRET—” as a start of block and end of block and, between, will format the encode string in base64 and write in the ransom note.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 25. CREATION OF THE RANSOM NOTE AND PUT THE RAGNAR SECRET AT THE END OF IT</p>
<p>Later, the malware will create a new string with the strings:</p>
<ul>
<li>.ragnar_</li>
<li>hash of the name of the victim machine</li>
</ul>
<p>This string will be used later as the new extension in the crypted files. After this the malware will enumerate again the logic units of the system with the function “GetLogicalDrivesW” and, to check if the unit is correct, will use the function “GetVolumeInformationW” and check the type of the unit and avoid the type of CD-ROM. For each logic unit it will enumerate all files and folders and will start the crypto process.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 26. GET ALL LOGIC UNITS AND CHECK THEM</p>
<p>Before starting the crypto process, the malware will try to write the ransom note in the root of each unit that is found as a target.</p>
<p>The malware will ignore folders with these names:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 29. CHECK OF BLACKLISTED EXTENSIONS</p>
<p>These checks are in place to prevent the ransomware from destroying the operating system as the victim needs to have access to the machine to pay the ransom.</p>
<p>For each file that passes all controls a thread will be created that will encrypt it. After creating all threads, the malware will wait for up to an infinite amount of time with the function “WaitForMultipleObjects”.</p>
<p>In the crypto process, in the threads, the malware will check if the file has the mark “_RAGNAR_” at the end with the function “SetFilePointerEx” and by reading 9 bytes and checking if they are this string. If it has this mark the file will be ignored in the crypto process and will be renamed again (with an extension name based on the current machine name).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101776" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-30.png" alt="" width="778" height="602" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-30.png 778w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-30-300x232.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-30-768x594.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-30-167x129.png 167w" sizes="(max-width: 778px) 100vw, 778px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 30. CHECK OF THE MARK OF CRYPTO IN THE FILE</p>
<p>In other cases the malware will encrypt the file and at the end of it will write the block crypted of the key, used in a block of 256 bytes, and the nonce used in another block of 256 bytes and, finally, the mark “_RAGNAR_”, along with one byte as NULL to end the string (that makes 9 bytes). The key and nonce used in the Salsa20 algorithm are encrypted by the RSA public key embedded in the malware. This ensures only the malware developers can have the RSA private key that belongs to the public key used to decrypt the key and nonce and, thus, decrypt the files in the system.</p>
<p>Before writing this information, the malware will use the function “LockFile” and, when the process of writing the function is finished, “UnlockFile” to release the file already crypted. This is done to prevent the file being changed or deleted during the encryption process.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101777" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-31.png" alt="" width="546" height="487" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-31.png 546w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-31-300x268.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-31-145x129.png 145w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 31. WRITE THE NEW CONTENTS AT THE END OF THE FILE</p>
<p>After the crypto, or if the file is already crypted, the malware will change the extension to a new one, such as “.ragnar_45EF5632”.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101778" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-32.png" alt="" width="903" height="302" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-32.png 903w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-32-300x100.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-32-768x257.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-32-205x69.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 32. CHANGE OF THE EXTENSION OF THE CRYPTED FILE</p>
<p>After all threads of crypto, the malware tries to get the session of the Terminal Services or the session of the user logged in the local machine with the function “WTSGetActiveConsoleSessionId”. With this session it gets the current process of the malware with the function “GetCurrentProcess” and the token of this process with the function “OpenProcessToken”. With the session that was got previously it tries to duplicate the token with the function “DuplicateTokenEx” and sets this token with the function “SetTokenInformation”. After this it will get the system directory with the function “GetSystemDirectoryW” and joins to this path the string “notepad.exe”.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101779" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-33.png" alt="" width="776" height="599" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-33.png 776w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-33-300x232.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-33-768x593.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-33-167x129.png 167w" sizes="(max-width: 776px) 100vw, 776px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 33. GET THE SESSION OF THE LOCAL USER OR TERMINAL SERVICES AND MANAGE THE TOKENS</p>
<p>With this prepared, the malware executes Notepad and, as an argument, the ransom note to show to the user what happened in the machine. The function used in this case is “CreateProcessAsUserW” to impersonate the user that had the session previously. Of course, this function is called with the desktop as “WinSta0Default”.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-101780" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-34.png" alt="" width="702" height="493" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-34.png 702w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-34-300x211.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/figure-34-184x129.png 184w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FIGURE 34. CREATE A PROCESS OF THE NOTEPAD TO SHOW THE RANSOM NOTE</p>
<p>After this the malware finishes itself with the function “ExitProcess” and a code of exit of 0.</p>
<h2>VACCINE</h2>
<p>RagnarLocker can have a vaccine if a program is made that can make the event, as explained in the technical part of this blog. If this event exists, the malware does not make anything in the system, but this type of vaccine is not likely to offer a long-term solution for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The way that the event is done, the malware developers can change the algorithm, or the order of the name of the event, or make a mutex instead of an event and the vaccine will stop working.</li>
<li>The algorithm has a hardcoded value. If this value is changed the final hash will be different and the vaccine becomes useless.</li>
<li>The malware is developed in such a way that if it has at least two arguments the event is not created so, if the operators want to execute with safety, they need only to execute with an argument, for example “&lt;malware.exe&gt; 1”.</li>
<li>The malware may evolve over time so the vaccine can be very fragile and limited.</li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons we think that a vaccine using this system is not helpful in the longer-term.</p>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>RagnarLocker is a simple ransomware, much like others that exist in the criminal market. Due to its small size, its operator’s aggressive behavior and the knowledge they seem to have that allows them to enter the networks of enterprises, as well as the threat to leak information if the ransom is not paid, RagnarLocker could potentially become a big threat in the future. Time will tell if RagnarLocker becomes a serious threat or disappears against a backdrop of other ransomware with more resources. The code is medium in quality.</p>

<h2>USING MVISION EDR TO DETECT RAGNARLOCKER</h2>
<p>With thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/author/mo-cashman/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mo Cashman</a> and Filippo Sitzia</p>
<p>We downloaded a RagnarLocker sample from Virus Total to test detection capability by MVISION Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR). We tested first with the original sample which was known to most detection engines by this time. We then changed file hashes to test detection with an unknown sample. In both cases, MVISION EDR identified the suspicious behaviors and raised alerts. The original sample was detected as a HIGH Risk because the file had a known malicious reputation in McAfee Global Threat Intelligence which is integrated with MVISION EDR. The unknown samples were detected as Medium Risk and most likely would have triggered further inspection by a security analyst.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>People working in IT support and incident management right now face unusual difficulties supporting large remote workforces and managing unpredictable workloads. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/fc4l48/coronavirus_and_supporting_remote_workforce/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">On Reddit</a>, systems admins and other IT professionals are bemoaning the hiccups and hassles of working in isolation during the pandemic while trying to resolve issues and maintain high service-level agreements.</p>
<p>Among other problems, you can&#8217;t go grab your indispensable subject-matter expert for troubleshooting, because that person is also home and inundated with messages and alerts.</p>
<p>Networks, VPNs, and servers are <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/itops-monitoring-tb/it-ops-monitoring?lx=O4Iukj&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">being hammered hard right now due to higher usage of SaaS apps and collaboration tools</a>. User expectations are even more grandiose than normal: IT organizations are expected to make applications and services work flawlessly—and to do so overnight.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, IT pros are working assiduously to keep the wheels moving for their employers during a time of crisis. Yet working longer hours isn&#8217;t the answer. You need <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/it-support-with-ai/ai-transform-it-service-management?lx=f4_9S2&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">new ways of working</a>—ones that may prove better than the current status quo for the long term. And that involves turning <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/want-transform-it-incident-management-shift-left" rel="noopener noreferrer">the incident management process</a> on its head.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to flip the process.</p>
<p><em>[ Join the discussion in this June 18 Webinar, <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/enterprise-service-management-tb/are-itsm-and-enterpr?lx=XrrwBl&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">Are ITSM and ESM One and the Same</a>? </em><em>Plus</em><em>: Learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/enterprise-service-management-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to optimize your Enterprise Service Management</a> ]</em></p>
<h3>Problem first, metrics second</h3>
<p>In many organizations, the process of incident management and resolution begins with people looking at screens full of metrics. You see a spike in something, such as network I/O, and immediately begin to investigate it, assuming the worst.</p>
<p>A more adverse scenario occurs when users call out problems on Twitter, Reddit, or other popular communities, creating a noxious PR situation that IT and the business must swiftly respond to and manage. This ad hoc, reactive fire drill takes time, and resolving that particular issue may not be the most important item of the day.</p>
<p>In software development, it&#8217;s akin to the bad practice of designing the architecture of a system first and then the user experience.</p>
<p>Given everything that&#8217;s at stake in the foreseeable future of stay-at-home mandates, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/sre-practice-5-insights-googles-experience" rel="noopener noreferrer">site reliability engineers (SREs) </a>and IT support technicians need to flip the incident management process.</p>
<p>Rather than beginning with the metrics and working backwards to uncover the problem, if there even is one, start by looking for the most important problems to solve. Then discover the resources and components that support that end-user process, and, finally, analyze the most relevant metrics.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<ol>
<li>A B-to-C provider of a streaming video service experiences a 200% increase in daytime traffic that results in sluggish load times and glitches.</li>
<li>IT has tagged the components beneath that service, so IT operators know exactly which virtual machines, databases, and load balancers come into play.</li>
<li>Next, the operations team can identify the most relevant metrics, such as CPU idle time, to measure and take steps to correct.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Take this 5-step proactive approach</h3>
<p>It sounds so simple—just flip the process—but it&#8217;s not that easy. IT operators and SREs aren&#8217;t accustomed to thinking in terms of which problems to solve or prevent. Being proactive or predictive hasn&#8217;t been the common workflow.</p>
<p>Here is how IT operations and DevOps teams can take a proactive approach to managing the availability and health of enterprise services.</p>
<h4>1. Coordinate across departments</h4>
<p>Identifying the most critical problems to solve right now is the hardest step and will take the longest. Common problems these days are related to cost and scale: How do I right-size my environment to reduce costs or handle more workloads?</p>
<p>Broaden your field of inputs to narrow down to the specific issue, such as slow page loads on the financial reporting website. Product managers, account managers, and business unit leads who are closest to the customer experience can deliver feedback on the top issues affecting customer/user satisfaction.</p>
<p>Teams should also review recent support tickets to identify common themes of pain.</p>
<h4>2. Fine-tune your approach to metrics</h4>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Utilization Saturation and Errors (USE) Method </a>is one way to approach the problem-first incident management process. As detailed by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/brendangregg/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Brendan Gregg</a>, a senior performance architect at Netflix, this methodology begins by posing questions, seeking answers, and working backwards to the metrics.</p>
<p>For each resource you want to measure, identify three metrics: one for utilization, one for saturation, and one for errors. &#8220;The USE Method has made you aware of what you didn&#8217;t check: what were once unknown-unknowns are now known-unknowns,&#8221; Gregg explained.</p>
<h4>3. Standardize workflows</h4>
<p>Create a common process for incident management across all your teams. Without the advantage of having almost everyone in the same room to huddle together in an ad hoc fashion when big issues crop up, it&#8217;s imperative to institute clear steps and roles.</p>
<p>Doing so will prevent the frustrations, confusion, and oversights that needlessly delay resolution. Since most incidents are composed of multiple contributing factors, teams need to adopt a small number of user-friendly tools to document and organize the information.</p>
<p>At our company, we&#8217;re now using tools such as Miro, an online whiteboard application, to replace our physical whiteboarding sessions. Of course there&#8217;s also Zoom, Slack, Jira, and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-use-chatops-boost-business-engagement-across-teams" rel="noopener noreferrer">a host of other cloud-based tools</a> already in place at many organizations. Mandate which tools everyone should use, and provide some guidelines on how to use them.</p>
<h4>4. Increase automation </h4>
<p>In some organizations, scaling requirements in response to demand have increased tenfold. <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/it-service-management-tb/ai-transform-it-service-management?lx=-rqtPA&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automation is playing a critical role now</a>; moving away from a web GUI, for example, is more scalable and aligns with modern tools such as Chef and Puppet.</p>
<p>User tickets can be auto-generated, for instance, from emails, and linked to code management systems such as GitHub. Modern development and operations teams are also expanding automation in unit testing and provisioning.</p>
<h4>5. Watch for burnout</h4>
<p>Whether because there&#8217;s more work and/or a need to fill the hours during long quarantine days, many software engineers, testers, and architects are working longer days right now. Yet exhaustion and burnout can lead to errors and oversights along with low morale.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s up to managers to make sure that employees are taking breaks, working reasonable days, and having the time and energy to attend to personal needs.</p>

<h3>Work it backwards</h3>
<p>These days, with so many people working remotely, IT operations teams need new strategies to keep business operations running smoothly in a high-stress situation. That means flipping the incident management process by taking a problem-first approach and working backward toward <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-you-should-drop-it-speak-measure-success-business-terms" rel="noopener noreferrer">the metrics that relate</a> to quickly uncover the root causes. </p>
<p>Creating airtight communications and collaboration is the foundation for all of this. Provide the best tools possible to your teams, and deliver clear and frequent education on best practices to keep everyone on the same page and productive. And IT leaders should pave the way with encouragement, guidance, and moral support.</p>

<h2 id="h.ep69ae7wwxsl">The Next Generation of Cross Browser Testing is Ultrafast.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our hackathons were created to make a point. There is a better way to automate your testing. Browsers do not suffer from the same executional bugs that plagued them five, 10, or 20 years ago. What does create problems, lots of problems, is the rendering of the application across various viewports and screens. This reality means amajor shift in how you need to test, and you will learn and see for yourself what we mean by competing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Ultrafast Cross Browser Testing Hackathon, even more valuable than the prizes you might win, is the learning you will gain from competing. If you take on this challenge, you will learn how next generation cross browser testing works. If you want a quick summary — read this this blog post on <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/next-generation-cross-browser-testing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">next generation cross browser testing.</a> </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why participate in the Applitools Cross Browser Testing Hackathon?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, you will learn new skills. You get hands-on experience seeing how easily you can run tests once and evaluating behavior across the browsers that matter to your customers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, you experience a new way of running application validation. If you have your own multi-browser lab today, or if you use a third-party service that requires multiple tests run on multiple setups in parallel, you can see the difference in running the Applitools Ultrafast grid in comparison. And, if you have not considered running tests across multiple browsers – due to cost or complexity – you can reevaluate your decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, you can win prizes and bragging rights as a hackathon winner. To show the world, we will proudly display your name on our website. Your success will demonstrate your engineering acumen to your peers and anyone else that matters to you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
