<div>
<p>Appium released its first major version almost 7 years ago. Since then, Appium has rolled out a lot of new features and its automation backend architecture has evolved quite a lot. </p>
<p>Appium 2.0, the next major release, has been in talks for a couple of years now, as Jonathan Lipps and the team have been brainstorming and implementing new features. </p>
<h2 id="h-installing-appium-2-0-server">Installing Appium 2.0 Server</h2>
<p>Appium team has released 2.0.0-beta.10 recently with the official <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/appium/appium-plugins/blob/master/packages/images" rel="noopener">Appium image plugin</a> and some minor bug fixes and improvements over its earlier beta versions. Appium 2.0 beta versions can be installed using the below command:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">npm install -g appium@next </pre>
<p>Appium server can take up several optional arguments. In addition to the <a target="_blank" href="http://appium.io/docs/en/writing-running-appium/server-args/index.html#server-flags" rel="noopener">server arguments</a>, Appium 2.0 introduces new arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>-ah </em>to specify a directory to install Appium drivers</li>
</ul>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">appium server -ah /path/to/install/drivers driver install uiautomator2</pre>
<ul>
<li><em>-ka </em>or <em>–keep-alive-timeout </em>to specify the number of seconds the Appium server should apply as both the keep-alive timeout and the connection timeout for all requests. Defaults to 600 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><br/>appium server -ka 800</pre>
<h2 id="h-decoupled-drivers">Decoupled Drivers</h2>
<p>Appium drivers (UIAutomator2 driver, XCUITest driver, Espresso Driver, etc) are tightly coupled with Appium Server but from Appium 2.0 these drivers are separated from Appium Server and can be installed separately based on users’ needs. Creating custom drivers for any new platform or special use cases are going to be easy from Appium 2.0. </p>
<p>For example, in the future, we might have an Appium Wear driver to automate WearOS Apps or an Appium KaiOS driver to automate smart feature apps in kaiOS.</p>
<p>To list all the available drivers in appium, enter the following command:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">appium driver list
</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Listing available drivers</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">- uiautomator2 [not installed]</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">- xcuitest [not installed]</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">- youiengine [not installed]</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">- windows [not installed]</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">- mac [not installed]</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">- mac2 [not installed]</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">- espresso [not installed]</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">- tizen [not installed]</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">- flutter [not installed]</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">- safari [not installed]</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">- gecko [not installed]</pre>
<p>To install a driver for say uiautomator2 driver, Appium now has subcommands to install, update, etc</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">appium driver install uiautomator2<br/></pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Attempting to find and install driver 'uiautomator2'</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Installing 'uiautomator2' using NPM install spec 
'appium-uiautomator2-driver'</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Driver uiautomator2@1.61.2 successfully installed</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">- automationName: UiAutomator2</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">- platformNames: ["Android"]</pre>
<p>To view the list of installed appium drivers, type the following command:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">appium driver list --installed</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Listing installed drivers</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">- uiautomator2@1.61.2 [installed (NPM)]</pre>
<p>There are many other options offered by the Drivers CLI to install drivers from a specific source, update all the installed drivers, etc. This simplifies the overall installation process and users have the flexibility to choose to upgrade drivers without updating the server itself.</p>
<h2 id="h-plugins">Plugins</h2>
<p>Appium plugins will be here to help with the various use cases that require a change to Appium’s default behavior. These changes provide users an opportunity to build new plugins in the future, for example,  Jonathan Lipps is currently working on a driver for Roku smart TV!</p>
<p>The Appium team continues to maintain some plugins which can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/appium/appium-plugins" rel="noopener">here</a>. </p>
<p>Plugins help add arbitrary functionality before or after actual Appium commands. Also, the plugin can modify the Appium Server itself to introduce new commands and distribute them. For example, the current “image” plugin from Appium helps find an element by an image and also helps in image comparison too. </p>
<p>To list all available Appium Plugins:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">appium plugin list<br/></pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2714.png" alt="✔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Listing available plugins</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">- images [not installed]</pre>
<p>To install an Appium plugin, use this command and replace “images” with the name of the plugin you’d like to install:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">appium plugin install images</pre>
<p>To activate a plugin when starting the Appium server, use the following command (replace “images” with the name of the plugin you’d like to activate):</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">appium server -ka 800 --plugins=images -pa /wd/hub</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">[Appium] Welcome to Appium v2.0.0-beta.10</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">[Appium] Non-default server args:</pre>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">[Appium]   basePath: /wd/hub</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">[Appium]   keepAliveTimeout: 800</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">[Appium]   tmpDir:

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">[Appium] Available plugins:</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">[Appium]   - images@1.1.2 (ACTIVE)</pre>
<p>No code changes are required at this time in the client script to execute using the latest Appium server.</p>
<h2 id="h-other-breaking-changes">Other Breaking Changes</h2>
<p>The minimum node version required for the Appium server to run is node 12.</p>
<h2 id="h-summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A lot of new plugins are expected to come soon. The ability to easily create new drivers and plugins in Appium 2.0 will help solve many interesting use cases and problems that were hard to solve before. Watch this space as we share more details related to the same as it happens. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[The concept of a trail of breadcrumbs in the offensive security community is nothing new; for many years, researchers on]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<div>
<div>The concept of a trail of breadcrumbs in the offensive security community is nothing new; for many years, researchers on both sides of the ethical spectrum have followed the compass based on industry-wide security findings, often leading to groundbreaking discoveries in both legacy and modern codebases alike. This happened in countless instances, from Java to Flash to Internet Explorer and many more, often resulting in widespread findings and subsequent elimination or modification to large amounts of code. Over the last 12 months, we have noticed a similar trend in the analysis, discovery and disclosures of vulnerabilities in networking stacks. Starting with JSOF’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ripple20-critical-vulnerabilities-detection-logic-and-signatures/" rel="noopener">Ripple20</a>, which we analyzed and released signatures for, a clear pattern emerged as researchers investigated anew the threat surfaces in the tcp/ip stacks deployed worldwide. Microsoft was no exception, of course running the Windows networking stack dating back to the earliest iterations of Windows, and frequently updated with new features and fixes.</div>
</div>
<p>In fact, looking back at just the last 8 months of Microsoft patches, we’ve tracked at least 25 significant vulnerabilities directly related to the Windows network stack. These have ranged from DNS to NTFS, SMB to NFS and recently, several tcp/ip bugs in fragmentation and packet reassembly for IPv4 and IPv6.</p>
<p>That brings us to this month’s patch Tuesday, which contains several more high-profile critical vulnerabilities in tcpip.sys. We’ll focus on three of these, including 2 marked as “remote code execution” bugs, which could lead to wormability if code execution is truly possible, and a persistent denial-of-service vulnerability which could cause a permanent Blue Screen of Death on the latest versions of Windows.</p>
<p>There are clear similarities between all 3, indicating both Microsoft and researchers external to Microsoft are highly interested in auditing this library, and are having success in weeding out a number of interesting bugs. The following is a short summary of each bug and the progress we have made to date in analyzing them.</p>
<p><strong>What is CVE-2021-24086?</strong><br />The first vulnerability analyzed in this set is a Denial-of-Service (DOS) attack. Generally, these types of bugs are rather uninteresting; however, a few can have enough of an impact that although an attacker can’t get code execution, they are well worth discussing. This is one of those few. One of the things that boost this vulnerability’s impact is the fact it is internet routable and many devices using IPv6 can be directly accessible over the internet, even when behind a router. It is also worth noting that the default Windows Defender Firewall configuration does not mitigate this attack. In a worst-case scenario, an attacker could spray this attack and put it on a continuous loop to potentially cause a “permanent” or persistent DOS to a wide range of systems.</p>
<p>This vulnerability exists when Windows’ tcpip.sys driver attempts to reassemble fragmented IPv6 packets. As a result, this attack requires many packets to be successful.  The root cause of this vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference which occurs in <code>Ipv6pReassembleDatagram</code>. The crash occurs when reassembling a packet with around 0xffff bytes of extension headers.  It should be impossible to send a packet with that many bytes in the extension headers according to the RFC, however this is not considered in the <code>Ipv6pReceiveFragments</code> function when calculating the unfragmented length. Leveraging a proof-of-concept through the Microsoft MAPP program, McAfee was easily able to reproduce this bug, demonstrating it has the potential to be seen in the wild.</p>
<p><strong>What is CVE-2021-24094?</strong><br />This vulnerability is classified by Remote Code Execution (RCE), though our analysis thus far, code execution comes with unique challenges. Similar to CVE-2021-24086, this issue involves IPv6 packet reassembly by the Windows tcpip.sys driver. It is different from 24086 in that it doesn’t require a large packet with extension headers, and it is not a NULL pointer dereference. Instead, it is a dangling pointer which, if the right packet data is sprayed from an attacker over IPv6, will causes the pointer to be overwritten and reference an arbitrary memory location. When the data at the pointer’s target is accessed, it causes a page fault and thus a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). Additionally, an attacker can create persistence of the DoS by continually pointing the attack at a victim machine.</p>
<p>While the reproduction of this issue causes crashes on the target in all reproductions so far, it’s unclear how easy it would be to force the pointer to a location that would cause valid execution without crashing. The pointer would need to point to a paged-in memory location that had already been written with additional data that could manipulate the IPv6 reassembly code, which would likely not come from this attack alone, but may require a separate attack to do so.</p>
<p><strong>What is CVE-2021-24074?</strong><br />CVE-2021-24074 is a potential RCE in tcpip.sys triggered during the reassembly of fragmented IPv4 packets in conjunction with a confusion of IPv4 IP Options. During reassembly, it is possible to have two fragments with different IP Options; this is against the IPv4 standard, but Windows will proceed further, while failing to perform proper sanity checks for the respective options. This type confusion can be leveraged to trigger an Out of Bounds (OOB) read and write by “smuggling” an IP option <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/protocol/ip/option003.htm" rel="noopener">Loose source and record route</a> (LSRR) with invalid parameters. This option is normally meant to specify the route a packet should take. It has a variable length, starts with a pointer field, and is followed by a list of IP addresses to route the packet through.</p>
<p>By leveraging the type confusion, we have an invalid pointer field that will point beyond the end of the routing list provided in the packet. When the routing function <code>Ipv4pReceiveRoutingHeader</code> looks up the next hop for the packet, it will OOB read this address (as a DWORD) and perform a handful of checks on it. If these checks are successful, the IP stack will attempt to route the packet to its next hop by copying the original packet and then writing its own IP address in the record route. Because this write relies on the same invalid pointer value as before, this turns out to be an OOB write (beyond the end of the newly allocated packet). The content of this OOB write is the IP address of the target machine represented as a DWORD (thus, not controlled by the attacker).</p>
<p>Microsoft rates this bug as “Exploitation more likely”, however exploitation might not be as straightforward as it sounds. For an attack to succeed, one would have to groom the kernel heap to place a certain value to be read during the OOB read, and then make it so the OOB write would corrupt something of interest. Likely, a better exploitation primitive would need to be established first in order to successfully exploit the bug. For instance, leveraging the OOB write to corrupt another data structure that could lead to information disclosure and/or a write-what-where scenario.</p>
<p>From a detection standpoint, the telltale signs of an active exploitation would be fragmented packets whose IP Options vary between fragments. For instance, the first fragment would not contain an LSRR option, while the second fragment would. This would likely be accompanied by a heavy traffic meant to shape the kernel heap.</p>
<p><strong>Similarities and Impact Assessment</strong><br />There are obvious similarities between all three of these vulnerabilities. Each is present in the tcpip.sys library, responsible for parsing IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. Furthermore, the bugs all deal with packet reassembly and the RCE vulnerabilities leverage similar functions for IPv4 and IPv6 respectively. Given a combination of public and Microsoft-internal attribution, it’s clear that researchers and vendor alike are chasing down the same types of bugs. Whenever we see vulnerabilities in network stacks or Internet-routed protocols, we’re especially interested to determine difficulty of exploitation, wormability, and impact. For vulnerabilities such as the RCEs above, a deep dive is essential to understand the likelihood of these types of flaws being built into exploit kits or used in targeted attacks and are prime candidates for threat actors to weaponize. Despite the real potential for harm, the criticality of these bugs is somewhat lessened by a higher bar to exploitation and the upcoming patches from Microsoft. We do expect to see additional vulnerabilities in the TCP/IP stack and will continue to provide similar analysis and guidance. As it is likely to take some time for threat actors to integrate these vulnerabilities in a meaningful way, the best course of action, as always, is widespread mitigation via patching.</p>

            </div>
<p>Quantum computing is the next frontier in computer science. It can bring untold benefits, allowing the development of new materials, tackling pandemics and making the world a greener, safer place. But it also threatens to break the encryption that keeps our data safe from prying eyes. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2021/01/21/emmanuel-macron-presente-un-plan-quantique-de-1-8-milliard-d-euros-sur-cinq-ans_6067037_823448.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">France’s recent announcement</a> to invest €1.8b into Europe’s quantum computing effort – on top of Germany’s two billion euros and the EU’s one billion euro quantum strategy – will help ensure Europe doesn’t miss the boat on what is set to become the cornerstone of innovation in the coming decades.</p>
<p>In short, quantum computing is an entirely new paradigm for making calculations on computers. Today, all computing relies on sequences of ones and zeroes to make increasingly complex calculations, culminating in the smartphones, cloud services and the supercomputers that exist today.</p>
<p>Quantum computing uses peculiar characteristics of physics to allow machines to perform complex algebra calculations in one fell swoop: “It would take ten thousand years to factor something on the fastest computer today, that could be minutes or seconds given a sufficiently powerful quantum computer,” said McAfee’s chief technology officer Steve Grobman on a recent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/podcast/st20-quantum-computing-with-steve-grobman-jon-king/" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast</a>. “Think about it more as waves than binary,” added John King, a McAfee research fellow also on the podcast. “You reinforce the ones that you want, and dampen the ones that you don’t want,” he said.</p>
<p>To achieve these quirks of physics requires machines operating at temperatures colder than outer space, so it is unlikely that every person will have a quantum computer in their basement anytime soon. However, with the Internet and cloud computing, we <em>will </em>have the ability to harness the power of quantum computing remotely, just like data centres can be used from hundreds of kilometers away at the tap of a few buttons in a web browser today.</p>
<p>Nor is quantum computing always going to be superior to the well-developed binary technologies in place today, which are handsomely suited to making precise calculations. “Quantum computing is not well suited for general purpose computing, but for solving very specific math problems that are well suited to the quantum model,” said Grobman.</p>
<p>But the pattern-recognising abilities of quantum algorithms are uniquely well suited to complex problem. Think how to best distribute COVID-19 vaccines across populations, or even the world, or optimising global shipping networks leading to lower emissions from boats and planes.</p>
<p>On the flipside quantum is also, unfortunately, much better at breaking encryption algorithms than tradiditional computing power . Data that is considered secure today could be rendered public knowledge in the coming decade’s advances in quantum technology, with massive implications for company secrets and national security.</p>
<p>In the US and China, private and public actors are already pouring huge investments into quantum, and without considerable efforts, Europe exposes itself to gaping security holes, and missing out on harnessing the power of quantum to solve pressing problems such as climate change.</p>
<p><strong>This is why France’s recent announcement is not just timely, but necessary, for Europe to continue charting a path of global success in the future</strong>. Today, the theory of quantum computers is way ahead of their actual capability. But in 10 years, it will be a different story, and given the scale of the challenge, acting now is of essence.</p>
<p>Making the most of quantum is not just about building the computers themselves. The entire paradigm of computer science is being upended. Europe is already facing a shortage of computer scientists, and its future computer science graduates must have the tools and knowledge needed to harness this new technology. <strong>This is why France is right to focusing funding not only on research and equipment, but also talent and skills to power this computer science revolution.</strong></p>
<p>For McAfee, making the digital world safe is a top priority, and naturally our attention gravitates toward the opportunities and threats quantum computing poses to keeping data secure and safe.</p>
<p>But making the world a safer place isn’t just about preventing cyberattacks and encrypting valuable data. It’s equally about making the world greener and using the power of technology to solve our pressing societal and economic challenges. Quantum computing will play a key role in all these goals, provided the technology is in the right hands. Bad actors see the same opportunities in quantum to disrupt and bring chaos as we see in making the world a better place, and the only way to stymie their efforts is ensuring that Europe, along with the US and others determined to make the world a better place, stay one step ahead.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[While many aspects of the Agile Manifesto, created 20 years ago this month, remain relevant, one principle is holding organizations]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />

<div>
<p dir="ltr">While many aspects of the Agile Manifesto, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/agile-manifesto-20-whats-still-relevant-whats-not" rel="noopener">created 20 years ago this month</a>, remain relevant, one principle is holding organizations back. It&#8217;s the sixth principle, which states: </p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.&#8221;  </p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Agile purists have taken this to mean that unless your team collaborates face-to-face, you will be at a disadvantage. That mindset has been dangerous and wrong, because it has resulted in &#8220;rules&#8221; that require people on agile teams to be in the office, reversing previous policies that allowed for greater flexibility. But trust does not depend on seeing someone in person.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/agile-manifesto-dead-not-long-shot" rel="noopener">most of the Agile Manifesto still holds</a>, this principle is outdated. Those who hold on to forcing face-to-face communication will be at a disadvantage to competitors that embrace and adapt to change, as stated in the overarching principles of agile.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While there&#8217;s no question that face-to-face communication has benefits, <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/world-quality-report-2020-21-tb/agile-leadership-uncertain-times?lx=62a6Zf&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener">agile leaders in these uncertain times</a> have discovered that having a work-from-anywhere approach saves money and gives employees more flexibility. Yes, this trend has been <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-pandemic?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener">accelerated by the pandemic</a>, but it was already happening—and there&#8217;s no going back.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here&#8217;s how you can maintain a <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/distributed-agile-teams-8-hacks-make-them-work" rel="noopener">collaborative agile culture</a> during the pandemic—and beyond.</p>
<h3>Take advantage of a geographically distributed team</h3>
<p>A global team brings different perspectives and the opportunity for round-the-clock teaming without anyone having to work outside of normal business hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I&#8217;ve led mission-critical support teams with staff members in Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific, a distributed approach that allowed us to provide coverage without anyone receiving annoying wakeup calls.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another mistake agilists who misinterpret the sixth principle make: forcing team members to attend meetings outside of their business time zone. While it&#8217;s important to have strong communication and trust between team members, this does not mean you have to always have real-time meetings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even if your team is not geographically diverse, the freedom to hire outside of your location provides flexibility and diversity in hiring practices and allows people to <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/best-places-work-tech-5-lessons-dev-ops-security" rel="noopener">live in areas where real estate and the cost of living are more affordable</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As with all agile processes, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/are-self-organizing-agile-teams-realistic" rel="noopener">your team needs to self-organize</a> and determine the communication strategies that work best for the team, while continuing to reflect and improve. There&#8217;s a multitude of communication tools you can choose from that foster teaming and collaboration and offer alternatives to face-to-face, real-time meetings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Misunderstandings can occur whether you&#8217;re using tools, email, or talking directly. However, the &#8220;paper trail&#8221; these tools generate provides a better avenue for being able to drill down and get to the root of misunderstandings and correct them. These tools also provide a better means for everyone to get on the same page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Often, it&#8217;s the face-to-face conversations that cause the biggest misunderstandings, and there&#8217;s no easy way to go back and analyze the root cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Foster personal relationships and stay focused</h3>
<p>The intent of the sixth principle of the Agile Manifesto was to serve as a reminder that we all communicate not only by what we say, but also with our body language. More trust can be established when you are looking into someone&#8217;s eyes and read what they&#8217;re saying—and what they&#8217;re not saying—through their body language and tone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When teams are in the office together, camaraderie builds and people can easily share smiles, small talk, photos, frustrations, and all the ups and downs of their day. They can take walks to brainstorm, meet for coffee, celebrate birthdays, and go for happy hours. Friendships flourish, and work provides a place where people want to go every day because it&#8217;s where they see and work with their friends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">When people are not physically together, you need to expend more effort to foster those relationships. One way to do this is to turn on those cameras for online interactions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Most people don&#8217;t like to turn on their cameras because, let&#8217;s face it, with the cameras off, they are freer to multitask without anyone knowing. They keep one ear open to listen for their name during meetings, but more often than not, they&#8217;re on mute, maybe doing pushups, doing the laundry, or walking the dog.</p>
<h4>How to stay engaged</h4>
<p dir="ltr">During the pandemic, people are dealing with a lot of unusual circumstances, often with kids at home doing their classes over Zoom. Personally, I disagree with having rules of any kind unless they are agreed upon by the team. However, to build trust with your teammates, you need to listen and be engaged.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Make an effort to get to know your teammates personally. Take the time to share stories and pictures or have one-on-one chats and phone calls. Certainly, if you are a leader or manager, make one-on-ones a priority and keep your camera on as often as possible. Make sure you have a virtual open-door policy and maintain transparency, approachability, and availability.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Take advantage of <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/digital-transformation-fast-forward-time-adjust-accelerate" rel="noopener">the flexibility that comes with remote work</a>. Schedule walk-and-talk one-on-ones where you can walk and enjoy nature at the same time, in different locations. Let your entertaining pets join a chat, and let others know if you have to break away from a meeting for a personal issue, with the promise to catch up on whatever&#8217;s necessary.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The pandemic has taught us that there is no substitute for the human connection that can result when we are physically together. Indeed, in some agile teams I engaged with before the pandemic that had remote members, those remote participants felt excluded.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The rhetoric from agilists implied that the remote team members were at a disadvantage and could never be as effective as their co-located counterparts. But this is not the true mindset of an agilist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Agile teams must <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/remote-vs-office-software-teams-which-better" rel="noopener">embrace diversity and talent</a>, regardless of physical location or time zone, and provide opportunities for strong communication and collaboration.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Embrace change, self-organize, adapt, and improve</h3>
<p>Other than rebelling against the sixth principle that drove some behaviors that have been detrimental for teams, I&#8217;m a firm believer in the overall agile philosophies. For healthy teams, we need to have trust, strong communication, and caring, supportive relationships.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/distributed-vs-colocated-agile-teams-pros-cons" rel="noopener">no one-size-fits-all answers</a> that tell us the &#8220;best&#8221; way to communicate. Every situation is different, as is every team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">We live in an age with wonderful technology advancements that allow us to foster collaboration, communication, and teaming with people all over the world. At the same time, we can be spending physical time with our families.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Use this time to experiment and creatively communicate. Embrace and celebrate these technological advancements and their abilities to keep us connected during the pandemic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If I could make one amendment to the Manifesto, it would be to add trust over co-location as a value statement. Co-location is beneficial, but trust is golden.</p>
<h4>Keep learning</h4>
