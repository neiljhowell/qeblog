					<description><![CDATA[These days, spending time with friends face-to-face still isn’t always an option for teens. So, finding a fun, new app]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>These days, spending time with friends face-to-face still isn’t always an option for teens. So, finding a fun, new app can be a little like discovering your own private beach where you can chill out, connect with friends, and be thoroughly entertained. Keeping them safe on that digital beach? That’s where parents can make a difference.</p>
<p>With all the popular, increasingly sophisticated video apps available, it’s easy to understand why safety ends up being the <em>last</em> thing on our kids’ minds. I get it. My daughter and I recently sat for hours watching Tik Tok videos and laughing until we cried.</p>
<p>However, October is National Cybersecurity Month and the perfect time to hit pause and talk about how to stay safe on all the apps vying for our attention.</p>
<p><strong>Popular Apps to Monitor</strong></p>
<p><strong>Triller.</strong> The Triller app is a video-based platform, much like Tik Tok, that has been around since 2015. Triller has a variety of filters, and music kids can use with the videos they create.</p>
<p><em>What to monitor: </em>Triller’s content may not always be appropriate, and because viewers can leave comments on videos, there’s a risk of cyberbullying. Also, Triller has some privacy loopholes such as data collection, location tracking, and a public account default — all of which can be modified in Settings.</p>
<p><strong>HouseParty</strong> is a group video chat platform nicknamed the “Quarantine App” since its popularity increased by an additional 10 million users during the COVID lockdown. Houseparty allows users to invite friends and “friends of friends” into group video-chat sessions — much like a party. The app displays up to eight live streams on the screen at a time, creating an instant sense of community.</p>
<p><em>What to monitor.</em> Because the app allows “friends of friends” to livestream in a group, that unknown element opens the door to a number of safety issues. Encourage kids to deny join requests from unknown people. While some users leave rooms unlocked while live streaming their party, encourage your child to use the padlock function to limit conversations to people who know each other.</p>
<p><strong>Yubo.</strong> The Yubo app (formerly Yellow) is also called the “Tinder for Teens.” Kids can connect and live stream with people they know — and easily connect with people they don’t. If two users swipe right, Yubo will match them, and they can share Snapchat or Instagram names. Another app very similar to Yubo is the Hoop app.</p>
<p><em>What to monitor.</em> Content on Yubo can be explicit and cyberbullying can arise more often since fake accounts are common. Yubo’s swipe format promotes a appearance driven match standard may not be healthy for some teens.</p>
<p><strong>Byte.</strong> Another app similar to Tik Tok, Byte, features short-form videos. Byte, created by the Founders of the now defunct Vine app, lacks the filters and music of other video apps, but that’s okay; the simplicity is a plus for Byte fans.</p>
<p><em>What to monitor:</em> Be aware of inappropriate content, cyberbullying in comments, and unknown “friends” who may be part of your child’s Byte community. Online predators have been known to reach out to kids on this app. While unwanted followers can be blocked, surprisingly, Byte doesn’t give you the ability to make your account private.</p>
<p><strong>App Safety Basics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practice personal responsibility.</strong> The theme for Cybersecurity Month 2020 is <em>Do Your Part #BeCyberSmart</em>. With this in mind, discuss the responsibility that comes with owning technology, be it a smartphone, a game system, a smartwatch, or any other connected device. The goal, says <a target="_blank" href="https://staysafeonline.org/cybersecurity-awareness-month/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The National Cyber Security Alliance</a>,</p>
<p>“If you connect it, protect it.”</p>
<p><strong>Privacy settings.</strong> To protect privacy and keep unknown people from connecting with minors, maximize privacy Settings on each new app.</p>
<p><strong>Increase safeguards.</strong> Apps can be addictive and siphon family time, study time, and sleep. A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/parental-controls/mcafee-safe-family.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">comprehensive security solution</a> can help parents limit device time, monitor activity, and block risky content and apps.</p>
<p><strong>Share wisely.</strong> Even a 15-second video shared with “close friends only” can end up in the public stream. Advise your child to only share videos or photos they’d feel good sharing with the world.</p>
<p><strong>Protect personal information.</strong> Remind your child not to share private details about themselves or their family members with anyone online. This includes emails, full names, phone numbers, pet names, school names, or location.</p>
<p><strong>Block and report.</strong> Talk with your child about what you consider appropriate versus inappropriate content, how to block strangers, and how to report cyberbullying and scams.</p>
<p>Finally, keep talking with your kids — about everything. Ultimately, it will be your consistency in having honest, ongoing dialogue with your child that will be your most valuable tool in keeping them safe online.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The most recent Accelerate: State of DevOps Report describes what elite-performing DevOps engineers look like. The key differentiator for those DevOps-focused software]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/2019-accelerate-state-devops-report-how-elites-drive-high-performance" rel="noopener noreferrer">most recent Accelerate: State of DevOps Report</a> describes what elite-performing DevOps engineers look like. The key differentiator for those DevOps-focused software engineers is velocity. They iterate fast from commit to deployment, they deploy frequently, and they recover quickly.</p>
<p>Velocity via automation is fundamental to DevOps and CI/CD culture. Building the right pipes and process helps <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-descartes-labs-achieved-safe-mission-critical-continuous-delivery" rel="noopener noreferrer">create an elastic, scalable, and secured</a> infrastructure and applications.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how you can use cloud and DevOps principles to leverage and automate security.</p>
<h3>On-demand and self-service</h3>
<p>As a DevOps engineer you can help your clients provision any resource they want, without human interaction. How? Through preparation and templates.</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s a lot of work. And yes, you can integrate security into those templates. That way, developers don&#8217;t have to worry about misconfiguring the infrastructure. (For the most part, even when they worry, they still misconfigure it. They might as well use your template.)</p>
<h3>Provide secured, and broad, network access</h3>
<p>Working from home has become much more prevalent in the last six months or so, and it looks as if it&#8217;s here to stay. You need to allow your organization to provide secured access to any resource your developers need, from anywhere they want. This includes laptops, mobile devices, workstations, etc.</p>
<p>Since many of us share our at-home bandwidth with family members (and unintentionally our neighbors, too), you should <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/zero-trust-security-how-get-started" rel="noopener noreferrer">incorporate a zero-trust mechanism</a> in your networks and access points.</p>
<h3>Allow for rapid elasticity and resource pooling</h3>
<p>Provision and assign resources dynamically and at scale, as much as needed. A growing startup, for example, should design its infrastructure while thinking about the future. Someday it might have to support a hundred times, or even a thousand times, more users than it currently does.</p>
<p>Your design right now should support this growth automatically. There are many use cases where scaling down will also be necessary, so think about triggers for that as well.</p>
<h3>Measure your services</h3>
<p>One of the great powers of the cloud is that <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-cloud-based-apps-are-so-hard-manage" rel="noopener noreferrer">everything can be monitored</a>. The logs and metadata are there; you just have to activate them and stream them to your favorite log analysis software. It&#8217;s going to help you both for ops and security purposes.</p>
<p>You can control, detect, respond, and optimize. If you haven&#8217;t done it by now, enable your flow logs and choose &#8220;all&#8221; actions. (The default is to log accepted traffic, even though what&#8217;s rejected has much to tell you.)</p>
<h3>CI/CD is also all about automation</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/seven-key-enablers-continuous-testing" rel="noopener noreferrer">Add automated testing</a> to your CI process, so that any broken code will be detected quickly and the relevant developer will be notified and get a chance to push corrections fast as well. Code should be clean of operation bugs, but also of security bugs and issues, and there&#8217;s no reason not to test them together. This will give developers a lot of confidence in their code and in your pipe.</p>
<p>The CD process should allow teams a lot of independence; you should minimize the dependence on other teams for support or resource approval. As stated before, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-keybank-achieved-continuous-integration-delivery" rel="noopener noreferrer">build the pipeline</a> to be as self-service as possible; this will save you and your team time from repeating the same tasks, and specifically the security-related tasks that no one likes to do.</p>
<h3>Put these principles into action</h3>
<p>How exactly are you going to implement all of these principles and be awesome DevOps or DevSecOps engineers? With the right tools. You know a tool is right when it integrates well with your current pipe and processes.</p>
<p>Even if setup takes a little time, it&#8217;s going to save you a lot of time down the line. Elite performers automate any process they can and free up their time to do the things they have passion for.</p>
<p>Here are a few open-source tools that I find useful and that help me automate security along the CI/CD pipeline.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-commit:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thoughtworks/talisman" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Talisman</a> helps make sure your developers are not committing credentials and tokens.</li>
<li><strong>Secrets management:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS secrets manager</a> addresses the common bad practice of storing credentials in configuration files. Using a secrets manager can mitigate the risk of losing credentials.</li>
<li><strong>Software dependencies check:</strong> Everyone uses open-source and third-party code and packages, which often contain vulnerabilities. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">OWASP Dependency Check</a> helps check that problem on a regular basis.</li>
<li><strong>DAST:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">OWASP ZAP</a> scans your web applications.</li>
<li><strong>SAST:</strong> Check out <a target="_blank" href="https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">OWASP</a>&#8216;s analysis on different tools for this, based on the relevant coding languages they support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you&#8217;ve got what it takes to be an elite DevSecOps performer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Before optimizations Too many Selenium commands in a test can lead to tests that are dramatically slower and less reliable.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<h2>Before optimizations</h2>
<p>Too many Selenium commands in a test can lead to tests that are dramatically slower and less reliable. Every Selenium command carries the potential for an invalid element locator or a synchronization issue. </p>
<p>Below we have a table that shows an automated test that was designed to click two radio buttons. V1 test is making 157 Selenium commands and takes 95 seconds to execute. After optimizations, the same exact test executes 9 Selenium commands and runs in 17 seconds (5X faster).</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/4qf88G5OmFvicYOD8342m0/67f9c3e26399b89c679678ea4090531f/Nikolay_Selenium_2.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 2" title="Nikolay Selenium 2"/></p>
<p>Total test run time V1</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/2PdwvxH2wjJbPCjMAFSU7W/8ef2197447101b4addcbc3dc46411a61/Nikolay_Selenium_3.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 3" title="Nikolay Selenium 3"/></p>
<p>Number of web requests before optimizations (V1)</p>
<h3>What was the purpose of this test?</h3>
<p>The purpose of this test was to simply click two radio buttons on this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.techlistic.com/p/selenium-practice-form.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">URL</a>. </p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/7Bh8BzL1b9d42fxMrbWRYY/df78d7258b02482a163040078508fbc9/Nikolay_Selenium_4.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 4" title="Nikolay Selenium 4"/></p>
<h2>Identifying the inefficiencies</h2>
<p>The major contributor to the slow test time of such a simple test was the large number of unnecessary web requests.</p>
<h3>Attempting to click first radio button</h3>
<p>After loading the URL, the test takes ~60 seconds searching for random elements without taking a single action.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/2sAAdrMFkSsG0rkxBucoGH/255c39548667b5ea8cd2a6b64a60c950/Nikolay_Selenium_5.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 5" title="Nikolay Selenium 5"/></p>
<p>Unnecessary commands start at the 15-second mark and continue until 1:19, at which point the element is finally located and clicked.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/60QX6hnkDKYK8OVIcfTuCa/455edc504b820a07c1ecd498d5fb71cc/Nikolay_selenium_6.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay selenium 6" title="Nikolay selenium 6"/></p>
<p><b>Potential Waste</b>: 60 seconds on 1 element</p>
<h3>Attempting to click second radio button</h3>
<p>At 1:23, the test starts looking for the Female radio button.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/29crys9WCabuTnlavyEyRV/e70cb38772ab429cfdc3a926a5e649c5/Nikolay_Selenium_7.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 7" title="Nikolay Selenium 7"/></p>
<p>And finally clicks it at 1:28:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/7hcpyvYRp5SkzAwEWD926F/74d35dbb1a4d6773035a5310e76dbcfc/Nikolay_Selenium_8.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 8" title="Nikolay Selenium 8"/></p>
<p>&#8230;but not before making 16 more Selenium commands to check whether the element is displayed or selected.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/1CfqaMx9uCWgjZzInBE1BZ/001d99f1d52c948bf4efc138c0a47339/Nikolay_Selenium_9.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 9" title="Nikolay Selenium 9"/></p>
<p><b>Potential waste</b>: 3 seconds for every element.click()</p>
<h3>Post-click() Selenium commands</h3>
<p>Finally, there is an interesting pattern of wasted web requests that happens after every element click(). We can see that below:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/zFlYW74bOxtCWb3hcrenK/3986d1d533461a4cf8406681c58d1288/Nikolay_Selenium_10.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 10" title="Nikolay Selenium 10"/></p>
<p>It’s understandable that these are being performed to validate that the element is in the correct state after the execution of a click(). However, these actions are wasteful because Selenium would throw an error if the action wasn’t successful. Furthermore, the next action would fail with an exception if it depended on the state of the previous element.</p>
<p><b>Potential waste</b>: 2 seconds per element.click()</p>
<h2>The refactor using cleaner practices</h2>
<p>The refactoring of this test was extremely simple and required only a few minutes after understanding the root cause of the problem. Furthermore, we saw that the final outcome of the refactoring created a test that was 560% faster and drastically more stable because it had fewer Selenium commands.</p>
<p>Here’s the code after we finished refactoring:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/1qGim9lteXAjj7FvuX3MxF/b0f50e2458f4a1d2197a4bd6a44bcc6c/Nikolay_Selenium_11.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 11" title="Nikolay Selenium 11"/></p>
<p>This is the <a target="_blank" href="https://app.saucelabs.com/tests/d853239cec5041f3a6f6ec85342e3be5" rel="noopener noreferrer">test execution result</a> and below is the screenshot.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/3Ruv9nbEkTFYxvfaJmXVtn/2f96e47612918802ae021907d5362f8b/Nikolay_Selenium_12.png?fm=webp" alt="Nikolay Selenium 12" title="Nikolay Selenium 12"/></p>
<h2>Lessons learned</h2>
<p>Bloated tests in the industry are infamously common and it’s something that I tackle on a weekly basis. They typically come with a framework that we use for our automation. I’ve seen this with both OSS frameworks and especially homegrown ones. The key is to consider the impact of extra Selenium commands on the overall automation program. In this use case, the test suite execution time will be five times longer for the entire organization. This obviously decreases the feedback cycle time and also <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/blog/using-the-continuous-testing-benchmark-to-build-digital-confidence" rel="noopener noreferrer">makes the automation less reliable</a>.</p>

<div>
<p>Quite recently, I gave a talk at <a target="_blank" href="https://2020.seleniumconf.in/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium Conference 2020</a> Virtual on <a target="_blank" href="https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2020/proposal/13303/how-to-build-an-automation-framework-with-selenium-patterns-and-practices" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>How to build an automation framework with Selenium: Patterns and practices</b></a>. In this session, I talked about what are some of the basic building blocks of a good test automation framework implementation and some good <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/06/29/design-patterns-in-test-automation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">design patterns</a> to follow and anti-patterns to avoid.</p>
<p>If interested, You can see all the slides for this on <a target="_blank" href="http://automationhacks.io/slides/docs/ui_automation_framework/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">my blog site</a> and the video once ConfEngine releases it on their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ConfEngine/videos" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>After this talk, it led me to think more deeply in terms of what are the mistakes that we as testers/automation engineers make in our test automation, and could we rather avoid these in the first place and, well, not <b>do it</b> in the first place <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />?</p>
<p>I’ve been personally burnt due to some of these mistakes in my career and so I wanted to take some time out and write this post, in order to shed some more light on these mistakes and how you can avoid making them in your test automation code.</p>
<p>We will discuss these in the UI automation context but some of these are general test automation anti-patterns to avoid.</p>
<p>Let’s get started, shall we?</p>
<h2><strong>Writing Assertions Inside The Page Objects</strong></h2>
<p>When we write <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">UI automation</a> using the page object pattern, initially it could be quite tempting to even put assertions inside the page object classes, I’ve personally been guilty of this. However, doing so leads to unnecessary complexity in the page objects wherein you might end up writing multiple methods to satisfy both positive and negative scenarios on a given page.</p>
<p>However, if your assertions are kept outside the page objects and mostly in your Test files or Test helpers, then you can treat the page object as just an abstraction for a given <b>Page or Component</b> and reuse the same method to verify different outcomes.</p>
<p>Writing assertions in tests is a very natural readable thing to do as your colleagues don’t have to dig into a long page object to figure out what the test is trying to assert. Angie Jones also alludes to this in her very insightful post on <a target="_blank" href="https://angiejones.tech/page-object-model/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tips for healthy page objects</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, you can adopt the same philosophy even when writing Functional API automation. Keeping assertions in test files instead of deeply nested layers of abstraction ensures you follow the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" rel="noopener noreferrer">KISS (Keep it simple, stupid)</a> principle while resulting in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20separation%20of,code%20of%20a%20computer%20program." rel="noopener noreferrer">good separation of concerns</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Writing WebDriver API Methods in Tests/Page Objects</strong></h2>
<p>While creating a UI automation framework, it is quite easy to fall in the trap of writing <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/06/30/selenium-4-new-window-tab-screenshots/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium WebDriver</a>/<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/category/appium/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Appium</a> Driver methods (driver.sendKeys(), driver.click()) directly in your page objects, or even in tests.</p>
<p>The main problem with such an approach is that you are mixing different responsibilities into page objects and test classes. Your test classes should be all about performing a single atomic action and verifying its outcome using meaningful well-written assertions.</p>
<p>Having WebDriver methods in tests is a really bad idea since if there are any changes in Selenium WebDrivers API or different versions of the library, then you would have to make these changes in all your test files/page objects.</p>
<p>It’s always a good idea to wrap third-party libraries into your own abstractions since this prevents these dependencies leaking throughout your framework and is a way to write clean code (You can read more about clean code <a target="_blank" href="https://automationhacks.io/2018/11/25/basics-of-writing-clean-code/" rel="noopener noreferrer">in my article</a> or in this great <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/04/22/clean-code-in-tests-what-why-and-how/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clean Code</a> article by Corina Pip).</p>
<p>Instead, It is much better to write wrapper functions over WebDriver methods in a <b>BasePage</b> class and either inherit or compose this in all your page objects. This way, if anything changes, you have to make these changes in a single place instead of fixing these in multiple places. This very nicely adheres to the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="noopener noreferrer">DRY (Don’t repeat yourself)  principle</a> which is considered a very good programming practice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have WebDriver APIs in your test methods, You’re Doing It Wrong.</p>
<p>– Simon Stewart</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Writing Long E2E Tests with Multiple Actions and Assertions</strong></h2>
<p>When writing <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">test automation</a>, it is often quite convenient to model entire user journeys as long winding E2E tests with multiple intermediate assertions. You can even argue that it leads to writing less code. However, these tests in the long run turn out to be a nightmare because of multiple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They execute very slowly since most of these are from the Web/Mobile level which inherently has multiple factors leading to slow speed.</li>
<li>If one earlier assertion fails, none of the succeeding assertions are executed, leading to a lack of coverage.</li>
<li>These tests are quite flaky and non-deterministic, when they fail it’s often due to multiple different reasons, leading to great difficulty in debugging and maintaining these.</li>
</ul>
<p>Above are some of the reasons why this is a bad idea. So what can we do?</p>
<p>Instead, prefer to write shorter, more targeted <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/03/12/creating-ui-automation-that-is-focused-reliable-and-fast/" rel="noopener noreferrer">atomic tests</a> that verify a single aspect of your system under test functionality.</p>
<p>It’s quite useful to refer to the <a target="_blank" href="https://automationintesting.com/2019/08/trims-automation-in-testing-strategy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">TRIMS</a> heuristic coined by Richard Bradshaw of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MOT (Ministry of testing</a>/<a target="_blank" href="https://automationintesting.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automation In testing</a> fame).</p>
<p>The most obvious benefit that you get by writing atomic tests is that they are very easy to parallelize and deterministic in nature. When they fail, it usually is for a single reason and hence it’s quite easy to debug and maintain them.</p>
<h2><strong>Treating UI Automation as The One and Only Hammer for Every Nail</strong></h2>
<p>UI automation that works is quite wonderful to watch. Quite often one common mistake made by new budding automation engineers (after learning the WebDriver API) is obviously to try and use it for every use case that they can think of.</p>
<p>What could very well have been a medium-sized test suite to verify essential functionality (that could only be verified on the UI), turns into a gigantic suite of UI automation that tests every possible functionality from the UI <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f92f.png" alt="🤯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Such a huge suite is a debugging and maintenance nightmare and very quickly turns into a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns" rel="noopener noreferrer">point of diminishing return</a> wherein you spend more time maintaining these flaky tests than spend time improving the quality of the product by the numerous other activities that you could have done.</p>
<p>I know, it’s not easy to let go of the temptation. But trust me, this is a hard choice that should be made sooner than later.</p>
<p>So what could we do?</p>
<p>Be more intentional and mindful of your automation. Treat UI automation as a part of your automation stack, but <b>not the only part</b>. You could instead test more functionality via the API or push some of these tests into Component Level tests instead of E2E tests.</p>
<h2><strong>Test Automation can Replace Exploratory Testing</strong></h2>
<p>One common mistake that a lot of organizations make is to think that <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/03/26/automation-testing-for-beginners-ultimate-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer">automated testing</a> is the only flavor of testing that’s needed to handle the scale of the organizations.</p>
<p>You would hear crazy claims/call to actions to automate 100% of the manual test cases as if that’s going to magically get translated into a high-quality product (valuable to the customer).</p>
<p>Test automation, while being a very powerful tool in the tool belt of a skilled tester, is not the only weapon and is quite inefficient in creatively exploring the product and thinking of its different flaws all the while exploring it. It is often inflexible in that it cannot change on the fly to different demands that your product might have, however, exploratory testing can.</p>
<p>Thus, instead of one being the replacement of others, think of them as two amigos and two sides of the same coin: with test automation as a way to get rid of the boring repeatable steps and to take care of giving the fast feedback that the team needs, whereas exploratory testing as a way to find the different areas of the system that are not yet explored and can feed into future automation projects or find really hard to detect bugs.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Are these the only mistakes that an automation engineer can make? Heck no, I’m sure you would have made some yourself. Why not share your experience around it with the community so that we can all learn from them and maybe not make them in the first place</p>
<p>If you found this post useful, do share it with a friend or colleague. Until next time, Happy Testing/Coding <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/262e.png" alt="☮" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<div>
<p>Manoj Kumar published a <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/selenium-4/" rel="noopener noreferrer">teaser on Selenium 4</a>, listing the new features expected and important deprecations across the Selenium Suite( Selenium IDE, Selenium WebDriver, and Grid). </p>
<p>This has already caused a buzz in the industry for not only testers but for the Ops and Dev communities as well. And why wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>Features such as the integration of DevTools APIs with Selenium Webdriver and Observability add a lot of value and expand Selenium’s reach.</p>
<p>Many requests were made by the community, asking for details on each of the features. Hence we started this series of posts addressing the features of Selenium 4.</p>
<p>In the first <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/selenium-4-migration/" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> of the Selenium 4 series, we discussed the deprecated components and their replacements.</p>
<p>In this blog post, as well as the next one, we will focus on some of the new features offered in Selenium 4, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relative Locators</li>
<li>Window and Tab Management</li>
<li>Chrome DevTools Protocol (next post)</li>
<li>Observability (next post)</li>
<li>Enhanced Exceptions (next post)</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/how-to-install-selenium-4/" rel="noopener noreferrer">install Selenium 4</a> to be able to try the features we’ll discuss.</p>
<div class="small-cta">
<h2 class="heading-secondary">Webinar: Test Driving Selenium 4 with Angie Jones</h2>

</div>
<h2 id="h.eqka15d8494y">Relative Locators in Selenium 4</h2>
<p>All the engineers working on building web-based test automation scripts spend quite a bit of time writing and maintaining locators across the builds. It can be challenging to locate a few of them, especially the grids. </p>
<p>Tools such as Sahi and Taiko already have features to locate nearby elements by specifying the directions, however to accomplish this in Selenium requires complicated Xpath or CSS selectors to navigate to a “direction” around the hierarchical tree nodes in the DOM. This limitation often leads to inefficient locators, which make the tests brittle.</p>
<p>Relative Locators have come to the rescue by helping us locate elements based on their position with respect to other elements.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://angiejones.tech/selenium-4-relative-locators/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relative locators</a> provide a newly added locator strategy to the existing eight (id, name, XPath, cssSelector, linkText, partialLinkText, className, and tagName) locator strategies. Relative locators locate the elements with respect to nearby specified elements.</p>
<p>A new method withTagName() is added, which returns an instance of RelativeLocator.RelativeBy class, a child class of By and offers methods to specify the direction of an element to be located.</p>
<pre id="h.hd241mdm7m8c" class="wp-block-preformatted">above()</pre>
<p>Used to locate an element just above the specified element</p>
<pre id="h.tzw7s8ffabyr" class="wp-block-preformatted">below()</pre>
<p>Used to locate the an element just below the specified element</p>
<pre id="h.tm1xnun7njcd" class="wp-block-preformatted">toLeftOf()</pre>
<p>Used to locate the an element located on the left of a specified element</p>
<pre id="h.ub47tke6i305" class="wp-block-preformatted">toRightOf()</pre>
<p>Used to locate the an element located on the right of a specified element</p>
<pre id="h.ytfqi6p52lfq" class="wp-block-preformatted">near()</pre>
<p>By default, it is used to locate an element at 50 pixels distant from a specified element. The distance can be passed as an argument to an overloaded method.</p>
<p>Let’s learn to use them with an example. We will use <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/category/advanced-topics/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advanced Blogs on Applitools</a> webpage for this exercise.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>
<p>On the Landing page we could see 12 blogs with titles and links to the blogs listed in four rows and three columns each. Inspecting the page, we see each of the elements are listed using the ‘article’ tag and an id attribute.</p>
<p>For instance, I need to locate the Blog ”How to Visually Test React Components Using Our Storybook SDK,” which is visually located just below the first blog, “Migrating to Selenium 4: Here’s What Has Changed”.</p>
<p>Inspecting the DOM, I learned that all blogs have the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.javatpoint.com/html-tags" rel="noopener noreferrer">html tag</a> “article” and the blog “Migrating to Selenium 4: Here’s What Has Changed” has an attribute id as “post-22539”.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="394" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0.png" alt="pasted image 0" class="wp-image-23761" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0.png 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-300x74.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-1024x252.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-768x189.png 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-1536x378.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
<p>I could now locate “How to Visually Test React Components Using Our Storybook SDK” specifying its html tag “article” using withTagName(“article”) method and locating the “How to Visually Test React Components Using Our Storybook SDK” element with below() method as demonstrated on line 18.</p>
<p>First the “Migrating to Selenium 4: Here’s What Has Changed” blog is located using the id attribute and then below() method is used as direction to locate the “How to Visually Test React Components Using Our Storybook SDK” blog element.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/ShamaUgale/b5e81d28bb9e32f9b2ecec4b5b8c647b.js</p>
</div>
<p>Similarly, refer to the sample code for the usage for above(), toRightOf() and toLeftOf() methods.</p>
<p>For more information on Relative Locators, <a target="_blank" href="https://angiejones.tech/selenium-4-relative-locators/" rel="noopener noreferrer">see this article by Angie Jones</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h.rvklczo2ffy2">Multiple Windows and Tabs</h2>
<p>Need to work with multiple windows or applications in a single test flow?  This is now possible!</p>
<p>We can create and open a brand new or tabbed window in the same session without having to create a new driver object to manage multiple applications in the same test.</p>
<p>This can be done with the newWindow() method.</p>
<p>On line 23 of the following code snippet, we create a brand new window by passing WindowType.WINDOW to newWindow() method. This will create a new window with the same driver reference.</p>
<p>On line 25 we open <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> in this window by using navigate().to() method or get() method.</p>
<p>Similarly, we could create a new tabbed window by passing WindowType.TAB as a parameter to newWindow() as shown on line 39.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/ShamaUgale/827a77b279322dcdd6c6395605aabcb0.js</p>
</div>
<p>To switch between these windows, you need to fetch the window IDs just like in the above example from line no 27-36, as we have been doing it in the previous versions of Selenium WebDriver.</p>
<h2 id="h.pl203j8ozjgb">W3C Standardization</h2>
<p>Selenium is a <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/blog/2020-front-end-automation-testing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">widely used tool</a> for end users as well as vendors. Other popular automation tools such as Appium and Protractor are built on top of Selenium APIs.</p>
<p>With this, the tools that integrate with Selenium 4 now need to follow the W3C standard protocol.</p>
<p>In previous versions of Selenium Webdriver, JSON wire protocol was used to communicate between the Selenium Webdriver APIs and the browser native APIs. Every request and response communicated across the protocol was encoded and decoded. With W3C compliance, the communication between WebDriver and the browsers happens directly without any encoding and decoding required.</p>
<p>This means any software following W3C standard protocol can be integrated with Selenium with no compatibility issues. All the major browsers such as Chrome, IE and Safari are already W3C standard compliant.</p>
<h2 id="h.3bst29ontuje">Summary</h2>
<p>We went through a few of the new methods and features implemented in Selenium 4 and have provided ready-to-use code snippets for working with new and tabbed windows, installing and uninstalling the addons for Firefox and taking element level screenshots.</p>
<p>We learned how to use a brand new locator strategy, the Relative Locators, introduced in Selenium 4. We also discussed the importance of W3C standardization for tool vendors and products built on top of Selenium.</p>
<p>In the next post of this series, we will explore more brand new features in Selenium 4 such as Chrome DevTools Protocol, and Observability, and Enhanced Exceptions.</p>

<h2><strong>Convenience vs. Online Security: Have Your Cake and Eat It Too</strong></h2>
<p>We live in a world where convenience is king. Personally, I don’t know what I would do without my calendar alerts popping up on my smartphone, ensuring that I don’t miss any important meetings (or birthdays).  I can also use a variety of apps to make appointments with my family’s doctor and check up on my kids’ educational progress while they are at home distance learning. While this technology is great and convenient, it has led to increased connectivity which tends to cause security implications. At what point do we draw the line between convenience and online security, and is there a way to ultimately have both? Let’s take a look.</p>
<h3><strong>Are Consumers Confident in Their Online Safety</strong><strong>? </strong></h3>
<p>Consumers want to live their lives fast. They are constantly on the go, prioritizing speedy technology and convenience – sometimes more than safety. As a result, basic security hygiene, like updating passwords, has fallen by the wayside. In fact, a <a target="_blank" href="https://securitybrief.co.nz/story/consumers-putting-convenience-over-security-due-to-covid-19-restrictions" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent survey conducted by YouGov</a> in April of 2020 revealed that consumers are overconfident in the level of protection that their credentials provide. 77% believe that their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/online-banking-simple-steps-to-protect-yourself-from-bank-fraud/" rel="noopener noreferrer">banking credentials</a> are the most secure, followed by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/online-shopping-scams-7-ways-to-fight-them/" rel="noopener noreferrer">online shopping</a> (74%), and work network logins (71%). Due to consumers’ overconfidence in the strength of their credentials, over half of online shoppers admitted that they have no plans to update their login details – and even more admitted to not updating bank and work passwords. As someone who just recently wrote a blog on common <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/what-does-your-password-say-about-your-preferences/" rel="noopener noreferrer">password habits</a> and how they can affect our online safety,</p>
<h3><strong>Finding a Balance Between Convenience and Security </strong></h3>
<p>As today’s users are trying to grasp what the “new normal” means for them and how they live their lives, many are branching out from the typical ways they used to order food, take workout classes, and more. Consumers are using food delivery sites that they’ve never used before and signing up for online fitness classes on new platforms to  stay healthy while social distancing. But by using these unfamiliar websites to establish a sense of normalcy, users might forget to take basic security precautions like making sure these websites have the standard <a target="_blank" href="https://" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://</a> security clearance or using a VPN. Paying attention to these security measures while exploring new platforms will allow users to enjoy the convenience of these tools without putting their online safety at risk.</p>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/lp/covid-19-dashboard.html;" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee Labs</a>, more than 113,000 websites have been published that used COVID-19 to lure internet users into giving up their personal details. But despite the risks associated with poor security hygiene, consumers appear to be pretty indifferent. When asked if <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-quarterly-threats-july-2020.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19 and increased fraud</a> influenced them to use alternative banking or shopping apps/websites with more secure options, <a target="_blank" href="https://securitybrief.co.nz/story/consumers-putting-convenience-over-security-due-to-covid-19-restrictions" rel="noopener noreferrer">over three-quarters of U.S. consumers</a> stated no, or that they didn’t know. At the onset of the pandemic when consumers were under pressure to buy scarce, staple items, <a target="_blank" href="https://securitybrief.co.nz/story/consumers-putting-convenience-over-security-due-to-covid-19-restrictions" rel="noopener noreferrer">26% of consumers</a> in the U.S. admitted to overlooking online security concerns by using third-party merchants to buy things like toilet paper and disinfecting products.</p>
<p>Today’s users already have so much to worry about – I can’t blame them if their online security is falling by the wayside to allow physical health and wellness to take precedent. It’s times like these when people need to prioritize their health and basic survival above all else that consumers benefit most from intrinsic security that is constantly working in the background, so they can have peace of mind.</p>
<h3><strong>Let Them Have Security (and Convenience!)</strong></h3>
<p>The good news: convenience and security don’t have to be mutually exclusive. I can still use my healthcare provider’s app to schedule appointments and check in on my kids as they distance learn without risking our family’s privacy. When it comes to balancing convenience and online security, you and your family should use trusted solutions that will allow you to enjoy <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/securing-digital-frontiers/" rel="noopener noreferrer">all that the internet has to offer</a>  by providing security that is easy, convenient, and empowers you to enjoy a safe and private digital live.</p>
<p>Users can enjoy a comprehensive, yet holistic approach to protection by employing the help of a security solution like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee® Total Protection</a>. Consumers are safeguarded from malware  so they can continue to use their devices and web browsing to stream live workout classes, catch up with family over video conference, and more. The software’s detection capabilities are constantly being updated and enhanced <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/security-software-and-device-performance/" rel="noopener noreferrer">without compromising users’ device performance</a>.</p>
<p>McAfee Total Protection also includes <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/safe-browser/mcafee-webadvisor.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee® WebAdvisor</a> – web protection that enables users to sidestep attacks before they happen with clear warnings of risky websites, links, and files. McAfee WebAdvisor allows consumers to online shop or order food from their favorite restaurant while giving them the peace of mind that they’re on a safe website.</p>
<p>McAfee Total Protection also includes our secure VPN to ensure your family is prepared for potential threats that could be lurking around the corner. By enabling a VPN on your device, you can feel confident that the next time you bank or pay bills online, your connection is secure. With solutions like McAfee Total Protection and McAfee WebAdvisor in place, consumers can strike a balance between convenience and security, without sacrificing either.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We all want to catch and fix problems as early as possible. In software development, this mindset helps development teams]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>We all want to catch and fix problems as early as possible. In software development, this mindset helps development teams create a culture of continuous improvement. To automate best practices, like Continuous Integration &#038; Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), teams are adopting tools that help automate continuous improvement. Google has created a great tool in Google Cloud Build.</p>
<p>By creating Google Cloud Build, Google has created a platform that helps every software developer from every walk of life, on teams of every size. Google Cloud Build is a fully managed cloud application development environment. It includes an associated set of build and test management tools that also encompasses automation and workflow controls, along with privacy and vulnerability analysis intelligence.</p>
<p>Regardless of the speed or scale that teams are able to build, test and deploy software. This is very much aligned with the vision of Applitools specially after the launch of the Ultrafast Visual Grid. Supporting an integration between Google Cloud Build and Applitools provides every software developer the ability to run their tests across all environments at the speed of light and get the feedback seamlessly in second as a part of the build process.</p>
<h2>Integrate Applitools with Google Cloud Build</h2>
<p>To get started, follow the following steps to integrate Applitools into your Google Cloud Build.<strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Create an account on Google Cloud Platform.</li>
<li>Step 2: Navigate to the Cloud build.</li>
</ul>
<p>Create the trigger and select your source code management tool (in this example I have chosen GitHub ) and  connect your repository.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>
<p>Allow the required access to perform the trigger runs on every commit on each branch or each pull request.</p>
<p>Edit your trigger and select the Build Configuration as <strong>Cloudbuild.yaml</strong> or <strong>Dockerfile</strong>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="881" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image4.png" alt="image4" class="wp-image-23723" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image4.png 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image4-300x165.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image4-1024x564.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image4-768x423.png 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image4-1536x846.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
<p>Once you make a small change in application and push it up to GitHub this will kick off the Cloud Build trigger you’ve just created.</p>
<h2 id="h.90kjt29rb4kb">Continue With Applitools Setup</h2>
<p>Now follow these steps to configure your Applitools setup.</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Navigate to admin panel in the Applitools eyes dashboard</li>
</ul>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="604" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image5.png" alt="image5" class="wp-image-23721" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image5.png 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image5-300x113.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image5-1024x387.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image5-768x290.png 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image5-1536x580.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
<ul>
<li>Step 2: Go to Teams and select your team</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="605" class="wp-image-23726" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image2.png" alt="image2" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image2.png 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image2-300x113.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image2-1024x387.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image2-768x290.png 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image2-1536x581.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Step 3: Select your team and Navigate to Integrations Section</li>
</ul>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="605" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1.png" alt="image1" class="wp-image-23728" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1.png 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-300x113.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-1024x387.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-768x290.png 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-1536x581.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
<ul>
<li>Step 4: Integrate your GitHub repo with Applitools</li>
</ul>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="769" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image3.png" alt="image3" class="wp-image-23725" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image3.png 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image3-300x144.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image3-1024x492.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image3-768x369.png 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image3-1536x738.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
<h2 id="h.6f1avrsl9qnm">Run Your Cypress Tests</h2>
<p>Now, run your Cypress tests on Google Cloud build.</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Let us clone the demo Cypress project from Applitools Cypress </li>
</ul>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/cypress.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://applitools.com/tutorials/cypress.html</a> </p>
<ul>
<li>Step 2: Create a<strong> cloudbuild.yaml fi</strong>le to pass the build steps.</li>
</ul>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/rmadhiapplitools/1033521c2be4fe0b7dc89a968ff89f86.js</p>
</div>
<p>To run a Cypress end-to-end test let’s use a Docker.</p>
<p>In the Docker file we have defined the steps to copy the Docker images, files, Cypress folder, add configurations and execute the scripts.</p>
<p>Make sure to set the APPLITOOLS_API_KEY as ENV variable or access it from secrets in the Docker file.</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper">
<p>Embedding: https://gist.github.com/rmadhiapplitools/6c343c4e25b86a91bea62dde956cfc7f.js</p>
</div>
<p>Applitools build status is reported based on COMMIT_SHA, hence we need to access the git commit_sha in the Docker and assign the COMMIT_SHA to Applitools BatchID as ENV variable.</p>
<p>Once the test is completed the curl command in Docker will perform a post call to update the build status.</p>
<p>Once you build your project. Applitools can visually validate each commit and reports the build status.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="788" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image7.png" alt="image7" class="wp-image-23724" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image7.png 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image7-300x148.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image7-1024x504.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image7-768x378.png 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image7-1536x756.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
