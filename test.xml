										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<p>XDR (eXtended Detection and Response) is a cybersecurity acronym being used by most vendors today.  It is not a new strategy. It’s been around for a while but the journey for customers and vendors has been slow for many reasons. For McAfee, XDR has been integral to our vision, strategy and design philosophy that has guided our solution development for many years. Understanding our road to XDR can help your organization map your XDR journey.</p>
<h2><strong>The Building Pressure for XDR</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s start with why <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/security-awareness/endpoint/what-is-xdr.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">XDR</a>?  The cry for XDR reflects where cybersecurity is today with fragmented, cumbersome and ineffective security and where folks want to go.  In my CISO conversations it is well noted that security operation centers (SOC) are struggling.  Disjointed control points and disparate tools lead to ineffective security teams.  It allows adversaries to more easily move laterally across the infrastructure undetected and moving intentionally erratic to avoid detection.  Analysts only know this if they manually connect the thousand dots which is time consuming leaving the adversaries with ample dwell time to do damage. It’s no secret. There is a lack of security expertise, and these are regularly tested.  Their investigations are cumbersome, highly manual, and riddled with blind spots. It’s nearly impossible to prioritize efforts, leaving the SOC simply buried in reactive cycles and alert fatigue.  Bottom line—SOC metrics are getting worse—while adversaries are becoming more sophisticated and creative in carrying out their mission.</p>
<p>XDR has the potential to be a one-stop solution to alleviating these SOC issues and improving operational inefficiencies.</p>
<h2><strong>XDR Options</strong></h2>
<p>Many cybersecurity providers are trying to offer an XDR capability of some sort. They promise to provide visibility and control across all vectors, and offer more analysis, context and automation to obtain faster and better response when reacting to a threat. Point players are limited to expertise in their domain (endpoint or network) and can’t offer a critical, proven cross-portfolio platform. After all, can your endpoint platform offer true XDR functionality it it’s not also connected to network, cloud and web?</p>
<p>McAfee’s long-time mantra has been Better Together. That mantra underscores our commitment to deliver comprehensive security that works cohesively across all threat vectors – device, network, web and cloud and with non-McAfee products.  Industry analysts and customers agree that McAfee is well positioned to deliver a solid XDR offering given our platform strategy and portfolio.</p>
<h2><strong>There is more to the McAfee XDR Story</strong></h2>
<p>Now, what if you had that same comprehensive XDR capability that not only offered visibility and control across the vectors, but also allows you to get ahead of adversary and empowering you to be more proactive. It could give you a heads up on threats that are likely to attack you based on global and industry trends, based on what your local environment looks like. With this highly credible prediction comes the prescribed guidance on how to counter the threat before it hits you. Imagine it also supplies prescriptive actions you can take to protect your users, data, applications and devices spanning from device to cloud. Other XDR conversations can’t take the conversation to this level of proactivity. McAfee can in our recently announced <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/xdr.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">MVISION XDR.</a></p>
<p>Not only does McAfee take XDR to the next level, but it also helps you better mitigate cyber risk by enabling you to prioritize and focus on what most matters. What if your threat response was prioritized based on the impact to the organization? You need to understand what the attackers are targeting. How close are they to the most sensitive data based on the users and devices? MVISION XDR offers this context and data-awareness to focus your analysts on what counts. For example, threats that jeopardize sensitive data from a finance executive on his device will automatically be of priority versus a maybe threat on general purpose device with no data. This data-awareness is not noted well in other XDR conversations, but it is with recently announced MVISION XDR<strong><em>.  </em></strong></p>
<p>Let’s look at McAfee’s journey and investment with XDR and how we got to this exceptional XDR approach.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-115705" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.png" alt="" width="750" height="422" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.png 750w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-205x115.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/></p>
<h2><strong>McAfee XDR Journey</strong></h2>
<p>McAfee’s XDR Journey did not simply start up recently because a buzz word appeared that needed to spoke to.   As noted earlier, McAfee’s mantra “Together is Better” sets the stage for a unified security approach, which is core to the XDR promise.  McAfee recognized early on that multi-vendors security ecosystem is a key requirement to build a defense in depth security practice. OpenDXL the open-source community delivered the data exchange layer or the DXL message bus architecture. This enabled our diverse ecosystem of partners from threat intelligence platforms, to orchestration tools to use a common transport mechanism and information exchange protocol. Most enterprise security architectures will be a heterogenous mix of various security solutions. McAfee is one of the founding members of the <a target="_blank" href="https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open CyberSecurity Alliance (OCA)</a> where we contributed our DXL ontology – enabling participating vendors to not only communicate vital threat details but inform what to do to all connected multi-vendor security solutions.</p>
<p>Realizing EDR is network blind and SIEM is endpoint blind, we integrated McAfee EDR and SIEM.  McAfee continues to deliver XDR capabilities by bringing multiple telemetry sources on a platform from a single console for analytics and investigation, driving remediation decisions with automatic enforcement across the enterprise.  When you combine  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201029005036/en/McAfee-Introduces-MVISION-XDR-Industry-First-Proactive-Data-Aware" rel="noopener noreferrer">MVISION XDR</a> the first proactive, data-aware and open XDR and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201112005143/en/McAfee-Announces-MVISION-Marketplace-MVISION-API-Enable" rel="noopener noreferrer">released MVISION Marketplace and API</a> further supporting the open security ecosystem for XDR capabilities, organizations have a solid starting point to advance their visibility and control across their entire cyber infrastructure.</p>
<p>Before all the XDR hype, McAfee customers have been on the XDR path. Our customers have already gained XDR capabilities and are positioned to grow with more XDR capabilities. I encourage you to check out the video below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Digital transformation has been a complex endeavor since businesses first started going down this path, and it&#8217;s not getting any simpler. The technology landscape runs from mainframe to PC, from mobile to server, and from on-premises operations to the cloud, with most organizations running some combination of the above.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-tb/digital-transformation-pandemic?lx=EGspVB&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener">Getting a handle on a digital transformation</a> today means trying to control as much of this as possible as you support the business’s broader goals of building new revenue streams, cutting costs, and minimizing overall risk.</p>
<p>While IT has traditionally been a cost center that helps in optimizing the business, in the new normal, CIOs must collaborate with the entire C-suite in order to move the business forward effectively, even if everyone has a different agenda. (And everyone always has a different agenda.) IT is no longer just about optimizing the business. It’s about delivering business.</p>
<p>To maximize the value of your digital transformation, focus on these four key areas.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Accelerate application delivery</strong></h3>
<p>It’s critical to be able to reliably scale agile and DevOps across all of your environments, from the mainframe to the cloud, while quickly <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb/high-perf-continuous-delivery?lx=-DC2cJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener">bringing innovations to life at the pace your business demands</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Simplify your IT transformation</strong></h3>
<p>By <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/hybrid-multicloud-management-tb/manage-cloud-complexity?lx=ooPdGt&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">simplifying the complexity of a hybrid IT environment</a> and unifying how you provision and manage it, you can transform into an agile, services-driven organization.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Strengthen your cyber resilience</strong></h3>
<p>Now more than ever, it&#8217;s critical to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cyber-resilience-tb/cyber-resilience-get-started?lx=dSbBFJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener">intelligently adapt your security posture</a> to respond to an ever-evolving threat landscape and protect your company’s most important assets: its data.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Analyze in time to act</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, you need to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/ai-ops-transform-it-tb/aiops-enterprise-6-t?lx=my3YKV&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">leverage machine learning </a>in order to transform unlimited volumes of data into accurate, actionable, and automated insights that are useful to the business.</p>
<h3>Shared architecture is key</h3>
<p>All four of these pillars should be built with a shared architecture in mind. It’s essential to avoid implementing a jumble of disparate products, each of which is designed to tackle a single aspect of this strategy. Instead, <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-value-stream-mapping-delivers-better-devops-toolchain" rel="noopener">implement tool chain components that work together </a>in a unified, cohesive manner.</p>
<p>Leverage common tools whenever possible, regardless of the underlying platform, and your teams should use them across functions, including strategic planning, development and operations, quality assurance, customer support, and security and governance.</p>
<h3>Your best option to get started: IT4IT</h3>
<p>This all sounds complex, but help is available, because this methodology and architecture has been standardized as part of <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-new-it4it-reference-architecture-game-changer" rel="noopener">the IT4IT Reference Architecture</a>, which lays out the groundwork of this implementation for you. The <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/why-interest-it4it-rise" rel="noopener">IT4IT standard is gaining traction</a> because it defines a comprehensive IT framework for delivering value to the business through key value streams—the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.opengroup.org/IT4IT/downloads" rel="nofollow noopener">standard has been downloaded</a> more than 10,000 times to date.</p>
<p>So how do you get started with this process, and what steps do you need to take to implement an IT4IT architecture foundation in your enterprise? The first step is to identify the stakeholders across your IT organization: the people who will be essential in implementing this strategy.</p>
<p>Then assess what systems currently exist in each of the functional buckets that serve as the backdrop to your architecture and ask which value streams are the most critical to standardize and improve. From there, the process is iterative. Determine which tools will meet your needs and implement them in iterations based on importance.</p>
<p>In several businesses we worked with, we created a visual map of all the tools the organization was using in order to paint a clear picture of its trouble spots and disconnects, and to develop an appropriate strategy for the business’s transformation.</p>
<p>For example, you can leverage IT4IT to solve <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/hybrid-multicloud-management-tb/ease-multi-cloud-management?lx=ooPdGt&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" rel="noopener">hybrid IT management challenges</a>. You do this by leveraging a common tool set to manage a closed-loop incident process that uses predictive technology to automate your customer support requests, connecting your assurance, support, consumption, and fulfillment functional groups.</p>
<p>IT4IT can also <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/optimize-devops-tb/software-factory-devops?lx=vm26kZ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener">improve DevOps automation</a> by increasing service reliability, helping you to visualize, analyze, and maintain IT health through a feedback loop that connects assurance, support, consumption, quality, and development—while accelerating delivery through automated release and fulfillment systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With everyone aligned on a common set of tools, the business runs more efficiently and with a greater alignment to the business’s overall goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How my team consolidated tool chains</h3>
<p>My team adopted these strategies and processes after recognizing the challenges and limitations of our own disconnected tool chains. (In our software build group alone, we were using 96 different tools, mostly due to many acquisitions.) Because of this disconnect, our IT group was unable to effectively connect with customers or support them, because everything was buried in different tool chains.</p>
<p>Resources could not be reused across departments, and teams didn’t trust one another from one department to the next because their operational environments were so different. Without the IT4IT reference architecture, we didn’t have an effective way of <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/optimize-devops-tb/devops-scale-software-factory?lx=vm26kZ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener">building a digital factory that could deliver digital products effectively</a>.</p>
<p>IT4IT was designed to correct this type of issue, and it’s been dramatically successful in our own ecosystem. Now we’re working on the next iteration of IT4IT, and there’s more innovation coming in the generation of the standard. IT4IT gives you the freedom to re-architect and re-engineer your existing processes—and best of all, it does so in a vendor-agnostic way, so you can freely move any element of your architecture from one vendor to another as needed.</p>
