										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Many teams are decomposing their work into a hierarchy of epic, feature, user story, and task. The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) has made this hierarchy popular, but many teams that have never looked at that model are using the same structure.</p>
<p>The idea is great. <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/confused-about-safe-epics-follow-real-world-example" rel="noopener noreferrer">Epics produce big valuable products or big valuable changes</a> to products. You decompose them into smaller chunks of value so you can <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb/high-perf-continuous-delivery?lx=-DC2cJ&amp;custom_url=continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener noreferrer">deliver solutions to your customers sooner</a> than waiting for a big-bang solution at the end.</p>
<p>Features are decomposed into high-value stories, which, according to definition, should provide value in production as well, and again it occurs faster than building a whole feature.</p>
<p>But there is a hidden anti-pattern in the way teams are <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/agile-strategy-how-go-projects-products-3-steps" rel="noopener noreferrer">decomposing work into an epic-feature-story hierarchy</a>.</p>
<p>Teams use agile tools to manage epics, features, stories, and tasks. But they too often use them to articulate a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure#:~:text=A%20work%2Dbreakdown%20structure%20(WBS,team%27s%20work%20into%20manageable%20sections." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">work breakdown structure (WBS)</a> instead of a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_breakdown_structure#:~:text=A%20work%20breakdown%20structure%20(WBS,components%20of%20the%20final%20product." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">value breakdown structure (VBS)</a>.</p>
<p>WBS refers to the common, age-old <a target="_blank" href="https://www.workbreakdownstructure.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">project-management practice</a> of breaking tasks into smaller chunks, allowing teams to estimate time and costs for completion. VBS, instead, focuses on <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/node/3827" rel="noopener noreferrer">product delivery and sub-products</a>, not tasks and sub-tasks.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to make this critical switch in thinking.</p>
<h3>WBS thinking results in poor user stories</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s the epic-feature-story hierarchy:</p>
<p><em>Figure 1. The epic-feature-story hierarchy. Source: Scaled Agile, Inc.</em></p>
<p>All too often, teams use these three types as containers for big tasks, medium tasks, and smaller tasks—just as with Microsoft Project years ago. But that leads to poorly written user stories.</p>
<p>Badly written stories have been around basically forever. The two most common poor-stories patterns are horizontal slices and lifecycle slices. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizontal slice: Create a table in the database for &#8220;New API&#8221;</li>
<li>Lifecycle slice: Design &#8220;New API&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many reasons these are poor stories, but in the context of WBS and VBS, the key problem is that they are items of work, not items of value. (There are many resources for <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/agile-leaders-guide-writing-user-stories" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to write great user stories</a>, so there&#8217;s no need to repeat that here.)</p>
<p>WBS has been used to plan development work for a long time, so it is deeply embedded in our muscle memory. And when we were project-driven, this was a great technique.</p>
<p>But with the movement away from project culture and toward product culture, this technique no longer works well. You need to think in terms of product delivery.</p>
<h3>Retrain your brain</h3>
<p>Here are two exercises to help people reframe agile development as a VBS instead of a WBS.</p>
<h3>Exercise 1: Understand what you are building</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you ask the team to articulate, at a high level, what it is building. Note that you&#8217;re not listing the steps to build it (that&#8217;s WBS) but instead are describing <em>what</em> it is (VBS).</p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>1. Create a list of what you are building</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s imagine the team says you&#8217;re building four things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new report on W</li>
<li>Modifying an existing report about X</li>
<li>A new screen with telemetry on Y</li>
<li>Bringing function Z, which exists in one organization, to three other organizations</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer could be a list such as the one above, or it could be a one-sentence answer such as &#8220;an autonomous vehicle.&#8221;</p>
<h4>2. Decide whether it&#8217;s an epic, feature, or story</h4>
<p>In a VBS, epics, features, and stories are the same thing: value delivery. It&#8217;s just that each has different rules and syntax due to each having a different level of risk.</p>
<p>Epics are highest risk, features are less risky, and stories the least risky. So epics require more rigor to ensure you have thought through the risks and have the best chance of success. </p>
<p>Additionally, every epic, feature, and story creates or modifies a product. That is the link to products in the &#8220;projects to products&#8221; journey.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is just a first estimate. So you need to decide based on the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Epics are value that will be delivered to production or be production ready in more than three months.</li>
<li>Features can be delivered in less than a quarter.</li>
<li>Stories can be delivered in less time than a sprint. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s shorthand for the same thoughts:</p>
<p>Keep that shorthand version handy for the next step.</p>
<h4>3. Match up the types with their value</h4>
<p>Looking at the list you created in Step 1, simply ask: How long would it take to deliver this value to production? &gt;1Q? &gt;1S? &lt;1S?</p>
<p>Then simply assign the correct type to the piece of value! Just like that, you now have epics, features, and stories in your backlog. Notice that you did not worry about this when you made your list of value.</p>
<p>Also, notice that your backlog has all three types in it, but so far there is <em>no</em> hierarchy. The work items are epics, features, and stories that started as those types without any upward traceability.</p>
<h3>Stumbling blocks in exercise 1</h3>
<p>This can make some people uncomfortable. Some feel that if a story or feature doesn&#8217;t trace to an epic, there is no container proving that the story or feature is valuable work. Some believe that all valuable work must be visible from the epic level, because the epic level (in SAFe) is also the portfolio level. And the portfolio level is where you make financial decisions about work.</p>
<p>But this is not actually correct. All three types—stories, features, and epics—are about value. The goal is to decentralize value decision making and push it downwards, where the risks are low. Stories and features are small, and the product owners and product managers are trusted and empowered to prioritize those types of work.</p>
<p>People can also feel as if these stories and features are &#8220;orphaned&#8221; if they don&#8217;t trace to a higher-level container. But, in fact, they <em>do </em>trace to a higher-level container: the product they are associated with.</p>
<p>Remember that all three types either modify or create products. In Azure DevOps, all of the stories, features, and epics use the &#8220;area path&#8221; field to designate what product they are affiliated with. And by doing that, you are linking all value delivery work to the products they create or modify.</p>
<p>In Jira, on the other hand, you can use &#8220;components&#8221; to represent the product that the work belongs to.</p>
<p>Whatever tool you use, don’t worry about tracing upwards. Just ensure that every epic, feature, and story traces to a product. And if you are using SAFe, how those products are funded and how those funds are used is decentralized by tying all epics, features, and stories to the funded products.</p>
<h4>Break down all features and epics</h4>
<p>At this point, you might have a pile of epics, features, and stories that need to be built. If all of the work is small, you may have only stories. If all the work is big, you may have a list of epics. Or you may have any combination, strictly based on the size of the work.</p>
<p>In the above example, perhaps W and Y were features due to size. X is small enough to do in one sprint, so it&#8217;s a story. And perhaps Z becomes three epics. There is no hierarchy here, just a pile of different size work to do.</p>
<p>While all items do not trace upwards, big items such as epics and features need to be decomposed so they can be prioritized with the other lower-level work that doesn&#8217;t trace upwards.</p>
<p>You can do this by asking, &#8220;What is a smaller piece of value we could do more quickly than this whole thing?&#8221; And as you decompose them, you do not decompose them into tasks but into value items.</p>
<p>And once you decompose features and epics into smaller value chunks, you once again ask, &#8220;How long would this take to put into production, or to make production-ready?&#8221; And again you give them the appropriate epic/feature/story type. Repeat this until every epic and feature has been decomposed to the story level.</p>
<p>Stories do not decompose into smaller value; you can decompose those into tasks. Note that tasks are the only element in the hierarchy that are like those found in a WBS. They are tasks, not value chunks.</p>
<p>In other words, the epics, features, and stories are all value chunks. The tasks are tasks, and they are optional.</p>
<p>Eventually every epic is decomposed into features. Every feature is decomposed into stories. And all of them are value chunks, not tasks. And thus you have a VBS instead of a WBS.</p>
<p>Some things in the original list of items were small enough to become features. Others were small enough to be stories. None of those trace up to a containing epic or feature if they started life smaller than that.</p>
<h4>The resulting story backlog</h4>
<p>So at the story level, you will have a bunch of stories, some of which are standalone, some that trace to features, and some that trace to features that in turn trace to epics. But all stories can now be prioritized against one another.</p>
<p>And if they do trace upward, that will be considered during sprint planning. You want to finish a whole feature if possible, so a high-priority feature would increase the priority of the stories as well.</p>
<p>Bottom line is that epic versus feature versus story is simply a first-level guess at the size of the effort to deliver value. It is almost like story point estimation, but at a much larger, easier level.</p>
<h2>Exercise 2: Fix an existing backlog</h2>
<p>For teams with an existing backlog that&#8217;s more WBS than VBS, this can be quite easy to repair. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1. </strong>Grab the current list of epics, features, and stories and leave it open in the background.</li>
<li><strong>2. </strong>Notice there is a hybrid of some items that are WBS tasks, and some that are products or value of the VBS type. It is common to have a mix of both styles.</li>
<li>3. Extract the products or value, and create a fresh backlog with only value delivery items. </li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish step 3, take a task-style backlog item and ask, &#8220;What product or sub-product does this create or improve?&#8221; The answer will be the real VBS item that should be in your backlog instead. If you can&#8217;t figure out the answer, then why would you do that task?</p>
<p>The third step can be fun and satisfying for your teams. Their new epics, features, and stories are true value work items. Each work item needs refinement, development, test, and deployment. Each is valuable to users.</p>
<p>Imagine that your story board columns were &#8220;refine, develop, test, deploy, done.&#8221; Notice that a WBS task-style story doesn’t work on a board such as this: &#8220;test component X&#8221; would make sense only in the test column, rather than flowing through them all.</p>
<p>Value-type VBS stories, on the other hand, flow through all of this. &#8220;New finance report V,” for example: Refine your understanding of it. Develop it. Test it. Deploy it. Done! Value to the user is achieved. But when &#8220;test component X&#8221; moves to done, direct user value has not been achieved.</p>
<h2>Measuring value delivery</h2>
<p>Once you move away from a WBS to a real VBS, you can easily report on value delivery. Which epics closed? That is value delivery. Which features closed? Value delivery. Stories? Value delivery.</p>
<p>So your value delivery reports can simply be reporting on work items closed. And it only works if the work items are real value delivery items, not work breakdown tasks.</p>
<p>Other Kanban state changes can be educational as well. Which epics moved into MVP delivered, testing the hypothesis now? Which features were pulled from the backlog into implementing? And so on. If every item is a value delivery item, these reports are satisfying and informative.</p>
<p>If someone wants a report of value delivery for their dollars, they can now show their recently done backlog and answer that question by just using their work management tools instead of creating PowerPoint slides. It is a beautiful thing!</p>
<h2>Make the switch</h2>
<p>Many people see their agile work management tools as a hierarchy of epic, feature, and story. And the muscle memory of a WBS is so strong, they overlay their WBS into the containers of epic, feature, and story.</p>
<p>Instead, focus on products, sub-products, and value delivery. Refactor existing backlogs by separating tasks from value. Think of the epic-feature-story hierarchy as nothing more than a first estimate on time. Epics take more than a quarter. Features require more time than a sprint. Stories are done within a sprint. And all are value delivery items in a VBS.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>In June <a target="_blank" href="https://www.applitools.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools</a> invited any and all to its “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.applitools.com/hackathon/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultrafast Grid Hackathon</a>”. Participants tried out the <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/ultrafast-grid/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools Ultrafast Grid</a> for cross-browser testing on a number of hands-on real-world testing tasks.</p>
<p>As a software tester of more than 6 years, the majority of my time was spent on Web projects. On these projects, cross-browser compatibility is always a requirement. Since we cannot control how our customers access websites, we have to do our best to validate their potential experience.  We need to validate functionality, layout, and design across operating systems, browser engines, devices, and screen sizes.</p>
<p>Applitools offers an easy, fast and intelligent approach to cross browser testing that requires no extra infrastructure for running client tests.</p>
<h2 id="h.c7tp85m7u1uv">Getting Started</h2>
<p>We needed to demonstrate proficiency with two different approaches to the task:</p>
<ul>
<li>What Applitools referred to as modern tests (using their Ultrafast Grid) </li>
<li>Traditional tests, where we would set up a test framework from scratch, using our preferred tools. </li>
</ul>
<p>In total there were 3 tasks that needed to be automated, on different breakpoints, in all major desktop browsers, and on Mobile Safari:</p>
<ul>
<li>validating a product listing page’s responsiveness and layout,</li>
<li>using the product listing page’s filters and validating that their functionality is correct</li>
<li>validating the responsiveness and layout of a product details page</li>
</ul>
<p>These tasks would be executed against a V1 of the website (considered “bug-free”) and would then be used as a regression pack against a V2 / rewrite of the website.</p>
<h2 id="h.m5inrnesihyf">Setting up Cypress for the Ultrafast Grid</h2>
<p>I chose <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cypress.io/" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cypress</a> as I wanted a tool where I could quickly iterate, get human-readable errors and feel <em>comfortable</em>. The required desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox and Edge Chromium) are all compatible. The system under test was on a single domain, which meant I would not be disadvantaged choosing Cypress. None of Cypress’ more advanced features were needed (e.g. stubbing or intercepting network responses).</p>
<p>The modern cross browser tests were extremely easy to set up. The only steps required were two npm package installs (Cypress and the Applitools SDK) and running</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">npx eyes-setup</pre>
<p>to import the SDK. </p>
<p>Easy cross browser testing means easy to maintain as well.  Configuring the needed browsers, layouts and concurrency happened inside `applitools.config.js`, a mighty elegant approach to the many, many lines of capabilities that plague Selenium-based tools.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>
<p>In total, I added three <em>short</em> spec files (between 23 and 34 lines, including all typical boilerplate). We were instructed to execute these tasks against the V1 website then mark the runs as our baselines. We would then perform the needed refactors to execute the tasks against the V2 website and mark all the bugs in Applitools.</p>
<p>Applitools’ <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/features/#visual-ai" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Visual AI</a> did its job so well, all I had to do was mark the areas it detected and do a write-up!</p>
<p>In summary, for the modern tests: </p>
<ul>
<li>two npm dependencies, </li>
<li>a one-line initialisation of the Applitools SDK, </li>
<li>6 CSS selectors, </li>
<li>109 total lines of code, </li>
<li>a 3 character difference to “refactor” the tests to run against a second website, </li>
</ul>
<p>all done in under an hour.  </p>
<p>Performing a visual regression for all seven different configurations added no more than 20 seconds to the execution time. It all worked as advertised, on the first try. That is the proof of easy cross browser testing</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.17.05.png" alt="Screenshot 2020 07 23 at 17.17.05" class="wp-image-20474" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.17.05.png 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.17.05-300x32.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.17.05-1024x108.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.17.05-768x81.png 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.17.05-1536x162.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
<h2 id="h.qj3lwzbsaw3">Setting up the traditional cross-browser tests</h2>
<p>For the traditional tests I implemented features that most software testers are either used to or would implement themselves: a spec-file per layout, page objects, custom commands, (attempted) screenshot diff-ing, linting and custom logging.</p>
<p>This may sound like overkill compared to the above, but I aimed for feature parity and reached this end structure iteratively.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.18.41.png" alt="Screenshot 2020 07 23 at 17.18.41" class="wp-image-20475" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.18.41.png 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.18.41-300x175.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.18.41-1024x598.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.18.41-768x449.png 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-07-23-at-17.18.41-1536x898.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, neither one of the plug-ins I tried for screenshot diff-ing (`cypress-image-snapshot`, `cypress-visual-regression` and `cypress-plugin-snapshots`) gave results in any way similar to Applitools. I will not blame the plug-ins, though, as I had a limited amount of time to get everything working and most likely gave up way sooner than one should have.</p>
<p>Since screenshot diff-ing was off the table, I chose to check each individual element. In total, I ended up with 57 CSS selectors and to make future refactoring easier I implemented page objects. Additionally, I used a custom method to log test results to a text file, as this was a requirement for the hackathon.</p>
<p>I did not count all the lines of code in the traditional approach as the comparison would have been absurd, but I did keep track of the work needed to refactor for V2 — 12 lines of code, meaning multiple CSS selectors and assertions. This work does not need to be done if Applitools is used, “selector maintenance” just isn’t a thing!</p>

<p>Applitools will intelligently find every single visual difference between your pages, while traditionally you’d have to know what to look for, define it and define what the difference should be. Is the element missing? Is it of a different colour? A different font or font size? Does the button label differ? Is the distance between these two elements the same? All of this investigative work is done automatically.</p>
<h2 id="h.mpn7xjs1bsf3">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all, it has genuinely been an eye-opening experience, as the tasks were similar to what we’d need to do “in the real world” and the total work done exceeds the scope of usual PoCs. </p>
<p>My thanks to everyone at Applitools for offering this opportunity, with a special shout out to Stas M.! </p>

<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Incorporating analytics into the enterprise toolkit can be straightforward or complex, relatively inexpensive or a multimillion-dollar initiative. It all depends on what you want to accomplish.</p>
<p>Analytics is simply a set of practices designed to aid analysis. It can be as basic as creating a paper report that shows monthly snowfall in a particular region, a spreadsheet that uses formulas to calculate entries from columns A and F and then write the results to column Y, or the results of far more complex methods of data reading, sorting, and discovery. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/guide-to-modern-data-warehouse-tb/share-bi-resources?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign= 00174153" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big data analytics</a>, a subset of analytics overall, is about the process of managing and investigating large datasets, typically stored in a repository such as a data warehouse or data store. These may reside on one or more public clouds or on an organization&#8217;s own on-premises hardware.</p>
<p>The sources of that data can be nearly any kind of system. Traditionally, these sources provide structured data as <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/node/3949" rel="noopener noreferrer">described in this story</a>, including transactional (sales-related) data such as point of sale, inventory, customer relationship management, and records from related systems. Structured data also includes information from IT operational systems and machine data from sources such as remote sensors and <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/how-tame-iot-guide-it-ops" rel="noopener noreferrer">other aspects of the Internet of Things</a>.</p>
<p>Less traditional is the storage of unstructured data for analytical purposes. Unstructured data—photos, video, audio, etc.—has been considered viable for analysis only over the past 15 years or so.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to know to start to make sense of all of your data.</p>

<h3>The modes of data query and analysis</h3>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt">Regardless of the data type, you store it to eventually learn what it may reveal. And you need an analytics process to help make sense of what&#8217;s there by asking questions that a database can interpret. This involves writing a query, done via a language that a database understands, such as SQL (Structured Query Language).</p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt"> </p>
<p>Querying a database via SQL long predates the big data phenomenon. SQL database vendors in the early &#8217;90s made it easier than it had been before for businesses to use SQL to understand trends in their acquired data. Another piece of this was also to create stored procedures that external applications could use to automate processing of back-end data storage and end-user results.</p>
<p>Nowadays, a big data query can certainly be an ad hoc question, because a business user might want to know how many bicycles he has sold to medium-income buyers in Illinois during the month of October.</p>
<h4><strong>Setting up standard queries</strong></h4>
<p>But a big data query is not always a &#8220;question&#8221; in the traditional sense of one that occurs to an analyst to ask relative to some emerging situation. Often, queries are set up to work automatically for routine reporting, or as some event triggers the need for analyzing the data on hand and producing some behavior.</p>
<p>In other words, standard queries can be set up to produce reports on a regular basis, for inventory and supply chain correlations, or about any number of routine operating statistics.</p>
<p>But standard queries can be set up for dynamic situations as well. Say a customer comes to your site and begins clicking on the images and high-level descriptions of bicycles you have for sale. A single click on a bike&#8217;s name and photo will take the customer to more details about the particular product.</p>
<p>But that same click can cause a variety of related items to display in the margins of the page—helmets, toe clips, side packs, lights, and other accessories. Most of us have experienced this kind of automated behavior when interacting with a commercial web page.</p>
<p>In this example, a user&#8217;s click on a specific bike triggers a preset query that&#8217;s designed to read a database of related items and display those items for the user to consider. Simple enough.</p>
<p>Now, imagine this is a returning customer, George, and you have some data accumulated on him—one or more items he&#8217;s bought in the past, or items he moved to the shopping cart but didn&#8217;t purchase, or any items clicked on during past site visits. In this case, you have even more intelligence regarding what to display in your margins for George.</p>
<p>That means your preset query not only returns items related to George&#8217;s current search, but items that specifically match his past behavior, and possibly his continued interest.</p>
<h3>Analytics&#8217; role in tracking consumer behavior</h3>
<p>Keeping track of consumer behavior is how video or music services make movie and song recommendations for you. Netflix, for example, uses prior data from customers to provide you with these kinds of educated guesses. It&#8217;s also how your favorite outdoor-gear retailer &#8220;knows&#8221; that you&#8217;re more likely to purchase clothing than climbing equipment, for instance, and therefore sends you targeted email when it begins a two-week sale.</p>
<p>In all cases, some system is running in the background, making recommendations for users based on accumulated data, predicting likely patterns of behavior, and adjusting offerings based on further data that the system gathers as the user browses the website in response to an email campaign.</p>
<p>Being able to set up this sort of cause-and-effect sequence of likely consumer paths is essential to intelligent business operations. But speed is also a major factor, since the faster a system can respond to these events—e.g., a click here, returning a new display there—the faster a business can act on that insight.</p>
<p>When you compare that capability to what happens on a static web page, where just the details of a bike the user clicks on get displayed, you see the opportunities that a more dynamic, data-driven process can create for the site owner.</p>
<p><em>[ How important is DX to your org? <a target="_blank" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DX00?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Take our survey</a> and find out how you stand next to the competition. Plus: <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/digital-transformation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172256" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get up to speed on digital transformation</a> with TechBeacon&#8217;s Guide. ]</em></p>
<h3>Why more data is always better</h3>
<p>Big data analytics can also show previously unrecognized patterns based not just on buying habits, but also on equipment failure rates, <a target="_blank" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/sentiment-analysis-concept-analysis-and-applications-6c94d6f58c17" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sentiment analysis</a> of massive volumes of text messages, or health indicators such as heart rate and blood pressure. The more data, the more correlations between various factors you can verify and use to predict and achieve the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Understanding consumer behavior and how to respond is one thing. Businesses can also please customers and help ensure repeat business by understanding their own operational needs and dependencies.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a simple example: Suppose you operate a pizza delivery business that supports multiple restaurants in a given area. Depending on geography, driving times based on traffic patterns vary throughout the day, from morning to midday to evening rush hour. Ideally, you can analyze where driving complexities lie during certain times of day. Google can provide basic route data, and estimate time to delivery.</p>
<p>But an accumulation of local data—based on knowledge of road construction work, current traffic conditions, and alternative routes—can allow you to get more specific. You might learn, say, that there are delivery times of plus or minus five minutes for some restaurants, and you can advise your customers accordingly.</p>
<p>You can also incorporate weather data: What&#8217;s the forecast? Those adjustments can allow more accurate delivery-time predictions. Without a big data analytics tool, you can&#8217;t predict your delivery time with much accuracy.</p>
<h3>Common modes of analytics</h3>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt">The key word in the previous paragraph is &#8220;predict.&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/3-ways-put-predictive-analytics-work-it-ops" rel="noopener noreferrer">Predictive analytics</a> is the art and science of probability-based data assessment and decision making. But it isn&#8217;t the only type of analysis that big data techniques can help with. </p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt"> </p>
<h4><strong>Descriptive analytics</strong></h4>
<p>This data set &#8220;describes&#8221; a state or condition that needs to be understood. One simple example: a printed report that shows how many trucks within a fleet of vehicles are available for deployment next Thursday. Electronic dashboards showing system throughput and computational workloads across a business&#8217;s IT environment is another; this uses data to help IT teams balance the loads properly and reduce bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Returning to the bicycle website example, when George 1) clicks on a bike image, and 2) all he gets is a set of details about that particular model, such as the average customer rating, that&#8217;s another example of descriptive analytics.</p>
<p>This sort of user experience is little more than a hierarchical display of goods for sale—a report, in a sense—with higher-level elements (bike photo, name, price) leading to lower-level elements (specifications, construction details, colors). This is certainly helpful information, but it&#8217;s not nearly the extent of what can be accomplished with data. </p>
<p>To be clear, descriptive analytics is extremely useful in some circumstances. It can help pinpoint what is wrong in a given situation so that corrective steps might be taken. When you feel sick and visit a doctor, you expect the doctor to know what to do about your condition so you&#8217;ll feel better.</p>
<p>As long as your condition can be described and it&#8217;s nothing out of the ordinary, it&#8217;s likely something that can be fairly easily diagnosed. For instance, your blood pressure can be compared against others in your age group, your doctor can show you the average (mean) statistics, and either assure you all is well or advise a new regimen to improve your numbers.</p>
<h4>Predictive analytics</h4>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/predictive-analytics-vs-ai-why-difference-matters" rel="noopener noreferrer">This type of analytics</a> is designed to predict an upcoming event, or at least understand the probability of something occurring. As such, it gives you a powerful tool for succeeding in a specific endeavor. In e-commerce, for example, the ability to predict your customers&#8217; buying habits based on known patterns is a great way to plan for your next steps.</p>
<p>If George, your prospective bike purchaser, is a returning customer, great. You know something about his buying habits, his preferences, and his decision-making process. But even if George is a new customer, the data you&#8217;ve retained from all your other customers can keep George interested and more likely to buy from you, or at least return at some later date. How does that work?</p>
<p>This requires you to build a predictive model<em>,</em> based on buckets of customer information acquired over months or years of interaction with bicycle customers. If George comes to the site and you have a collection of data that fits his demographics, what do customers like him typically buy? Can you assign a score to George based on his apparent interests and offer him something that has proved successful with other customers at his interest level?</p>
<p>If you have hundreds of customers like him, you have the basis for a model to use for displaying the accessories discussed earlier, plus other bikes, plus any number of elements from your retail bag of tricks that might keep him browsing. There are no guarantees, of course. But a user experience based on predictive analytics is clearly superior to one based on simple descriptive analytics.</p>
<h3>Use predictive models to manage the unknown </h3>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s a great thing about big data analytics: There are patterns lurking within the data that you&#8217;re likely not even aware of but that you can possibly discover and put to work. That&#8217;s where predictive analytics based on truly big data comes into play.</p>
<p>In the bike website example, the datasets amassed over time might not be huge, but they have helped you and your team understand some essential patterns that reveal buying behavior, including some patterns that describe a customer who is not interested. When you apply those same patterns to truly large datasets and use a system that can identify similar correlations between one activity and another, wholly new patterns that can lead to success may become evident.</p>
<p>Simply put, patterns are maps to behavior, human or otherwise. But why does it matter?</p>
<p>Imagine being able to sort through hundreds of thousands of details from your sales transactions to discover whether or not men in Canada between the ages of 25 and 40 tend to buy your thicker, dark socks in October. You do some correlations, and you find out—no! They tend to buy brighter colors during that month.</p>
<p>You can now run a sale and web promotion on those items—and watch your sales increase by 30%. You can add more variables, too, and test theories about buying habits based on income range or seasonal conditions. Is this going to be a harsh winter? Will that increase the probability of my sock sales or not?</p>
<h3>Removing some of the guesswork</h3>
<p>You might argue this is just an example of the educated guesswork that businesses have used for years, and you might be right. But big data analytics can take guesswork out of the picture when you encounter situations such as this.</p>

<p>Solutions architect <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/wswebcreation" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wim Selles</a> helps customers successfully implement and get the most value out of their investment in Sauce Labs. He loves to answer questions and help solve puzzles for customers—and he wants to make people as enthusiastic about mobile test automation as he is. </p>
<p>Wim conducts trainings, shares best practices, and travels the world (virtually, nowadays) to make this happen. He has two pieces of advice that he often shares with customers. First, create a solid test base that you can rely on. This will give you confidence in your automated testing efforts. Second, Wim recommends that you avoid coding for coding’s sake. Make sure what you’re doing is really adding value. </p>
<p>In addition to his passion for test automation, Wim enjoys contributing to the open source community—WebdriverIO, specifically— and spending time with his family and two young daughters.</p>

<div>
<p>At Applitools, we have tutorials showing you how to integrate Applitools with commonly-used CICD orchestration engines. You can already link Applitools with Jenkins, Travis, CircleCI. Each of these orchestration engines can automatically launch visual validation with Applitools as part of a build process.</p>
<p>What about GitHub Actions?</p>
<h2 id="h.jodcredoby3z">What is “GitHub Actions”?</h2>
<p>GitHub Actions is an API for cause and effect on GitHub: orchestrate any workflow, based on any event, while GitHub manages the execution, provides rich feedback and secures every step along the way. With GitHub Actions, workflows and steps are just code in a repository, so you can create, share, reuse, and fork your software development practices.</p>
<p>GitHub Actions makes it easier to automate how you build, test, and deploy your projects on any platform, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. This provides Fast CI/CD for any OS, any language, and any cloud!</p>
<p>Applitools provides automated Visual AI testing. It is easy to integrate Applitools with GitHub Actions, letting developers to test their code by running visual tests using GitHub Actions workflow.</p>
<p>For this article, I have chosen a Cypress automation project that has a single visual test with Applitools created before in my GitHub repo:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/satishapplitools/Cypress-Applitools-GitActions.git" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/satishapplitools/Cypress-Applitools-GitActions.git</a></p>

<p>Click on Actions tab in GitHub repository</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"></figure>
</div>
<p>GitHub Actions has an option to choose from several starter workflows based on programming languages, tools, technologies, and deployment options. Workflow prepares a YAML file at the end.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>For Applitools integration, we require Applitools API Key and pass Git Commit SHA as Applitools Batch ID.  In the code example above, I have set up the Applitools API key as GitHub secrets and that can be passed as a call to an environment variable in the GitHub Actions workflow (as shown below). To know more about GitHub Actions secrets click <a target="_blank" href="https://secrethub.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">secret hub</a>,</p>

<h2 id="h.xkvkips19gd8">Run Git Hub Actions workflow integrated with Applitools</h2>
<p>Now it’s time to run the integration.  Here are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let us create a new branch from master and name it as “feature branch”.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Make some changes in the feature branch and create a pull request to the master branch.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>GitHub Actions workflow understands there are changes made on the code, and it automatically kicks off the workflow and runs Cypress tests integrated with Applitools(as shown below)</li>

            </div>
<p>Happy Birthday! Today we mark the fourth anniversary of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nomoreransom.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">NoMoreRansom</a> initiative with over 4.2 million visitors, from 188 countries, stopping an estimated $632 million in ransom demands from ending up in criminals’ pockets. It would be fair to say that the initiative, which started in a small meeting room in the Hague, has been integral for so many in the perpetual fight against cybercriminals.</p>
<p>Powered by the contributions of its 163 partners the portal, which is available in 36 languages, has added 28 tools in the past year and can now decrypt 140 different types of ransomware infection. To think, just four years ago we started with only a handful of decryptors and partners. That speaks volumes to the commitment by all members to collaborate and work together to give victims a third option; #DontPay.</p>
<p>All this hard work took place in an ever-changing cybercriminal landscape; during those four years ransomware criminals shifted their tactics from “spray and pay”, mostly aimed at consumers, to highly organized crime groups actively seeking to paralyze complete organizations and extort them for astronomical amounts of money.</p>
<p>These challenges have not discouraged NoMoreRansom and its partners; on the contrary, having a strong public private partnership between Law Enforcement and the Private sector has proven essential in several (ongoing) investigations. Without a doubt, we will be the first to admit that fighting ransomware has not been easy but that should not stop us from doing things that are hard.</p>
<p>We are delighted to continue supporting this initiative and play our part in fighting this global problem. However, we have to stress that the fight against ransomware is far from over, in fact we need more collaborative initiatives to combat the rise in malicious activity.  Also, there are still many individuals and organizations that do not even know about NoMoreRansom. Even within the information security industry there are those who have not heard about the availability of free decryption tools.</p>
<p>Please share the message: #DontPay #NoMoreRansom</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you might have read in the previous blog posts on the brand new TestProject Python SDK (<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/getting-started-with-testproject-python-sdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part 1</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/20/creating-mobile-appium-tests-with-testproject-python-sdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part 2</a>), the SDK will generate great-looking HTML test reports and automatically publish them on the <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a> platform for you, out of the box, no additional configuration needed (you can also download them as a PDF file). <strong>But did you know that the reporting is also highly configurable?</strong> In this blog post, you’ll see all the options you have with regards to test reports and how to customize them according to your requirements in just a couple of short minutes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f40d.png" alt="🐍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/getting-started-with-testproject-python-sdk/#webinar-recording" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch this awesome webinar recording to get started with the TestProject Python OpenSDK!</a></strong> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f40d.png" alt="🐍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

</ol>
<hr/>
<p>Test reports are crucial in any test automation framework, and we all know how hard even an expert needs to work in order to generate test automation reports, not to mention if we want to have customization freedom too… There are many tailored solutions available in the industry to help us overcome this, such as: <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/junit-xml/" rel="noopener noreferrer">JUnit</a>, Jenkins plugin, ELK, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/05/12/make-your-selenium-test-results-live-using-grafana-and-influxdb/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grafana</a>, or even developing customized web dashboards.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, none are out of the box test reporting solutions. Enter <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject</a>, which provides users with a complete dedicated reporting environment that supports Selenium, Appium and Python, all for free. TestProject automatically creates the HTML and PDF reports for you (out of the box, no additional configuration needed).</p>

<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="out-of-the-box" rel="noopener noreferrer">Out of the box HTML test reports</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you leave all settings as they are, the SDK will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generate reports with the project, job and test names that are automatically inferred (see for more details <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/getting-started-with-testproject-python-sdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article</a>).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatically report a new test when the </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">quit()</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;"> command is called on a driver, or when the name of the test method that is executed changes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contain all WebDriver commands that were executed, along with their result (pass or fail).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redact values that are typed in sensitive (passwords) text field elements.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these options are configurable, as you will see soon enough.</span></p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="custom-project-job-name" rel="noopener noreferrer">Specify custom project and job names</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to override the automatically inferred project and job names that are displayed in your TestProject reports, you can do that in two ways. The first way is by passing custom project and job names as arguments to the driver constructor:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">from src.testproject.sdk.drivers import webdriver

def test_custom_project_and_job_names():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(projectname="My project", jobname="Reporting job")
    driver.get("https://example.testproject.io/web/")
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second way is by specifying them in the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">@report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decorator:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">from src.testproject.decorator import report
from src.testproject.sdk.drivers import webdriver

@report(project="My project", job="Reporting job")
def test_project_and_job_names_in_decorator():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.get("https://example.testproject.io/web/")
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both options will result in the specified project and job names being displayed in TestProject:</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><noscript><img class="alignnone wp-image-13411 size-full" title="Specify custom project and job names_TestProject Reports" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1.png" alt="Specify custom project and job names_TestProject Reports" width="1067" height="397" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1.png 1067w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1-512x191.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1-768x286.png 768w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1-1024x381.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1067px) 100vw, 1067px"/></noscript></p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="custom-test-name" rel="noopener noreferrer">Specifying a custom test name</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want a custom test name in your report (i.e., not the name of the test method), you can use the @report decorator for that as well:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">from src.testproject.decorator import report
from src.testproject.sdk.drivers import webdriver

@report(test="My custom test name")
def test_name_in_decorator():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.get("https://example.testproject.io/web/")
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When specified like this, the custom test name will be used instead of the automatically inferred one:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13412 size-full" title="Specifying a custom test name_TestProject Report" alt="Specifying a custom test name_TestProject Report" width="1106" height="305" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2.png 1106w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2-512x141.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2-768x212.png 768w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2-1024x282.png 1024w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1106px) 100vw, 1106px" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2.png"/></p>
<p><noscript><img class="alignnone wp-image-13412 size-full" title="Specifying a custom test name_TestProject Report" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2.png" alt="Specifying a custom test name_TestProject Report" width="1106" height="305" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2.png 1106w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2-512x141.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2-768x212.png 768w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2-1024x282.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1106px) 100vw, 1106px"/></noscript></p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="manual" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manual test and step reporting</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By default, the SDK automatically reports a new test when the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quit()</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> command is called on a driver, or when the name of the test method that is executed changes. This behaviour can be disabled:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">from src.testproject.sdk.drivers import webdriver

def test_disable_automatic_test_reporting():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.report().disable_auto_test_reports(disabled=True)
    driver.get("https://example.testproject.io/web/")
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can instead report a test manually like this:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">from src.testproject.sdk.drivers import webdriver

def test_report_a_test_manually():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.report().disable_auto_test_reports(disabled=True)
    driver.get("https://example.testproject.io/web/")
    driver.report().test(name="A manually reported test", passed=True)
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will result in the following test being reported on the TestProject platform:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13413 size-full" title="Manual test reporting_TestProject Reports" alt="Manual test reporting_TestProject Reports" width="1104" height="227" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image3.png 1104w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image3-512x105.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image3-768x158.png 768w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image3-1024x211.png 1024w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1104px) 100vw, 1104px" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image3.png"/></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, you can also report intermediate steps manually, and even add screenshots when you do so:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">from src.testproject.sdk.drivers import webdriver

def test_report_a_step_manually():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.report().disable_auto_test_reports(disabled=True)
    driver.get("https://example.testproject.io/web/")
    driver.report().step(description="An intermediate test step", message="An additional message", passed=False, screenshot=True)
    driver.report().test(name="A manually reported test", passed=True)
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">which will lead to this step being included in the test report:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13414 size-full" title="Manual step reporting_TestProject Reports" alt="Manual step reporting_TestProject Reports" width="1566" height="382" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image4.png 1566w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image4-512x125.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image4-768x187.png 768w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image4-1024x250.png 1024w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1566px) 100vw, 1566px" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image4.png"/></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, the step includes a screenshot (that will be enlarged when clicked). Also note that even though we set the manually reported test to passed in our code, it is marked as failed because of the failed step that is part of the test.</span></p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="redaction" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disable redaction of text typed into secured text fields</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By default, the SDK redacts text that is typed into a text field that is deemed to contain sensitive data, i.e.:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fields that have a </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">type</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;"> attribute with value </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">password</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (all browser and OS types).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fields of type </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">XCUIElementTypeSecureTextField</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (only on iOS with XCUITest).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Text typed in such a text field is replaced by asterisks in the report:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13415 size-full" title="Disable redaction of text typed into secured text fields_TestProject Reports" alt="Disable redaction of text typed into secured text fields_TestProject Reports" width="507" height="459" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image5.png"/></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you wish, this can be disabled:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">def test_disable_command_redaction():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.report().disable_auto_test_reports(disabled=True)
    driver.get("https://example.testproject.io/web/")
    driver.report().disable_redaction(disabled=True)
    driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#name").send_keys("John Smith")
    driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#password").send_keys("12345")
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">which leads to password values being reported in plain text, instead:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13416 size-full" title="Disable redaction of text typed into secured text fields_TestProject Reports" alt="Disable redaction of text typed into secured text fields_TestProject Reports" width="505" height="457" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image6.png"/></p>

<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="disabling-reporting" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disabling reporting</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, you also can disable various reporting to various degrees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t want to report WebDriver commands automatically, you can specify that as follows:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">def test_disable_driver_command_reporting():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.report().disable_command_reports(disabled=True)
    driver.get("https://example.testproject.io/web/")  # this command will not be reported
    driver.report().disable_command_reports(disabled=False)
    driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#name").send_keys("John Smith")  # this command will be reported
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to disable all reporting temporarily, you can do that, too:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">def test_disable_all_reporting_temporarily():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.report().disable_reports(disabled=True)
    # nothing will be reported here
    driver.report().disable_reports(disabled=False)
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you want to permanently disable reporting for a specific driver session, you can do that, too:</span></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">def test_project_and_job_names_in_decorator():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(disable_reports=True)
</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that in the last case, you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> re-enable reporting for the duration of the driver session!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, the TestProject Python SDK offers a variety of options to create the reporting you want very easily, solving one of the greatest challenges in open source testing. From now on, test reporting is a breeze thanks to the <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/14/announcing-testproject-new-opensdk/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestProject new OpenSDK</a>.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Employees today are more mobile than ever. As we saw, due to COVID-19 the majority of organizations moved their employees]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>Employees today are more mobile than ever. As we saw, due to COVID-19 the majority of organizations moved their employees to a work from home model overnight. This quick change of location forced businesses to implement solutions that would provide their workforces secure remote access to an increasingly complex corporate network. Notions that used to be simpler, like Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and the cloud stack further complicate secure access policy management as employees wander from the office. </p>
<p>While working from home can increase productivity, improve employee performance and reduce costs for organizations, it comes with its challenges. Slow mobile networks and latency when connecting to corporate web applications can put a burden on remote employees, resulting in decreased productivity. However, speed and connectivity aren’t the only challenges when it comes to mobile networks.</p>
<p>As cloud adoption and BYOD are on the rise, security and IT teams must face the challenge of securing the network from outside the office. If the organization is growing network security is harder to keep up with: more devices, more unique roles to account for, and unfamiliar IP addresses connecting to the network &#8211; all requiring proper security consideration. Without a deliberate approach, malicious actors can more easily compromise the organization’s network security from different points of entry.</p>
<p>To fight off potential attacks, organizations need to rethink their network security strategy by quickly adopting authentication and testing for vulnerabilities inside the network where their applications reside. </p>
<h3>Testing Environments and Networks Comes with Security Risks </h3>
<p>Automating the testing of mobile and desktop apps through the cloud saves organizations time, money, and resources but it is also crucial to make sure that this testing environment is secured. When testing applications, employees’ networks and connections must be secured in order to add another layer of protection against hackers trying to breach the testing environment. While Sauce Labs offers its Sauce Connect Proxy, a built-in HTTP proxy server that opens a secure &#8220;tunnel&#8221; connection for testing between a Sauce Labs virtual machine or real device and a website or mobile app hosted behind a corporate firewall, it is not the only security step to consider when testing remotely. </p>
<p>If an employee doesn’t have any kind of extra layer of defense when connected to his or her network, he or she is exposed to hackers trying to infiltrate their organization’s resources. One of the most common types of attacks on a network is unauthorized access. Hackers will gain entry by accessing the network by stealing employees’ weak passwords or infiltrating previously compromised users. </p>
<p>Another common risk is access control privilege escalation. This occurs when an attacker has gained access into the network and moves horizontally inside the network infrastructure and servers. This threat allows hackers to gain access to more resources and data with the original privileged access credentials they have stolen. </p>
<p>To avoid these types of attacks, organizations need to implement more concrete user restrictions with a privileged access model. This will allow them to limit who has access to their network and applications, and what they can access. By restricting access to a certain amount of users, you will decrease the number of authorized access risks to your network. With stricter network access rules in place, you will have a more secure testing environment as well. </p>
<h3>Security Solution for a More Secure Network</h3>
<p>Knowing about network risks is only half the battle. When discovering a risk to your organization, you need to clearly strategize how to address it and be proactive so it doesn’t happen again. One of the most effective ways for organizations to ensure a secure network for testing their applications is by implementing security solutions that have strong access policy controls. </p>
<p>A key benefit that comes with implementing a network security solution is the increased ability to find and fix network vulnerabilities and monitor network activity. With the help of security solutions sitting at the edge of your corporate network, you can quickly identify an attack and fix the exploitable endpoint which would otherwise have been an entry point for a successful attack. </p>
<p>Network security solutions offer a group of tools, policies, and data to help create a stronger comprehensive security strategy. The key motive when adopting security solutions is to increase the organization’s security from incoming attacks, meaning to make a successful attack an expensive and difficult prospect for any would-be hacker. </p>
<p>Alongside these security solutions, the organization will need to adopt accompanying company-wide policies that mitigate any insider risks the organization will face. Some organizations might not have the resources to implement an internal security strategy and in these cases a third party security solution will provide them with the right amount of security to fight off incoming attacks.  </p>
<h3>Moving Forward </h3>
<p>In today’s digital world, the biggest concern for organizations is data security. Attacks on organizations’ networks are happening more often and with a bigger impact, requiring companies to implement strong cybersecurity strategies in order to ensure  their network isn’t similarly vulnerable against unauthorized access. When testing your mobile and web application in a testing environment, make sure you have secure access to your corporate network. This is all it takes to test more applications without worrying about the security of your network. </p>
