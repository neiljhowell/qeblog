					<description><![CDATA[For organizations getting ready to move beyond Security Operations with their security approach and improve the cyber resiliency of their]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>For organizations getting ready to <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cyber-resilience-tb/state-secops-beyond-soc?lx=dSbBFJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">move beyond Security Operations with their security approach and improve the cyber resiliency of their systems</a>, some excellent startup tools exist. And, equally important, best practices are emerging.</p>
<p>One of the best places to start your resilience journey is with a cyber-resilience framework. They help an organization establish the goals and objectives for its resiliency strategy, as well as identify specific technologies needed to control, manage, and recover from cyber attacks.</p>
<p>By using a framework, an organization can craft a cost-effective, flexible, prioritized, and performance-based path to cyber resilience. A framework can also help an enterprise assess its current security stance and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cyber-resilience-tb/cyber-resilience-assessment?lx=dSbBFJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">identify areas for needed improvement</a>. As improvements are made, the framework can also be used to assess the progress of a resilience program.</p>
<p>There are a number of popular frameworks, but they all share some common elements. Here&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/cyber-resilience-tb/cyber-resilience-get-started?lx=dSbBFJ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">what you need to know about them</a>—followed by best practices for cyber resilience.</p>
<h2>Assess the risks</h2>
<p>An organization-wide assessment should be performed to identify all cybersecurity risks to the systems, assets, data, people, and capabilities of the enterprise. Important items covered by the assessment should include what the organization&#8217;s risk management strategy should look like; which cyber risks operations, individuals, and assets in the organization are facing; and what assets the organization uses to accomplish its mission.</p>
<p>When planning for risk management and resilience, organizations should be careful not to over-engineer their schemes, George Platsis, director of cybersecurity for FTI Consulting, <a target="_blank" href="http://securityintelligence.com/articles/creating-roadmap-toward-cyber-resilience/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">wrote recently</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It is a crude metaphor, but managing your cyber risk increasingly becomes more like managing your investment portfolio. It is tailored to you and your expectations. But if you are not on top of what’s going on, increasing complexity could lead to increasing volatility. That means your current and future outlooks could quickly be thrown into jeopardy.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/gplatsis" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">George Platsis</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;More importantly,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;if you are hoping to maximize business efficiency in your operations using this new gadgetry, then you may be setting yourself up for a colossal loss on the downturn, or a massive data breach that is nearly impossible to recover from could occur.</p>
<p>Indeed, IBM&#8217;s annual cyber-resiliency <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-45839&amp;_ga=2.1023858.255029181.1595266313-545301124.1591239208&amp;cm_mc_uid=78530529166215859305703&amp;cm_mc_sid_50200000=83358031595266312380" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">report</a> for 2020 noted that an excessive use of disconnected tools creates complex environments, which can have an adverse effect on an organization&#8217;s ability to detect, prevent, contain, and respond to a cybersecurity incident.</p>
<h2>Tally up your resources</h2>
<p>In addition to assessing risks, it&#8217;s also important to take a tally of resources—both technological and human. Such an analysis may reveal areas where automation or a managed service provider may be useful. Of course, nowadays it&#8217;s necessary to consider privacy issues when evaluating both present and future resources, especially when it comes to monitoring data or storing too much of it for too long.</p>
<p>Another typical recommendation is to develop and implement safeguards to make sure critical services will be delivered successfully. Those safeguards usually include controls to ensure entities have access only to resources needed to do their jobs or functions. They also include security education, which has become increasingly important as more and more employees are forced to work at home, noted James McQuiggan, a security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, a security awareness training provider.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;With COVID-19 and the increased number of people working from home, organizations&#8217; senior management recognize that the employees are being targeted more than before and require additional training to increase their knowledge of various cyber attacks.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/James_McQuiggan" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">James McQuiggan</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Development of activities and actions to identify a risk event quickly is also a common framework recommendation. Organizations need to clearly define the roles and responsibilities in play when a suspicious event is identified. They also should be monitoring their assets and networks for potential cyber risks and anomalies.</p>
<p>After risk events are detected, a response is in order. Frameworks typically recommend that enterprises have response procedures in place, that shareholders within the enterprise coordinate their response to the event, and that action be taken to prevent the event from continuing and spreading.</p>
<p>IBM says that having a cybersecurity incident response plan (CSIRP) is an important component of any resiliency strategy. It cautions, however, that the plans have to be reviewed frequently. &#8220;As the volume and severity of attacks increase year after year, the lack of an updated CSIRP may increase the risk of experiencing a significant disruption to IT and business processes,&#8221; it noted in its 2020 report.</p>
<p>Recovery is also a common characteristic among frameworks. Recommendations in that area involve restoring any damage from a cyber attack and conducting post-mortems to assess what can be learned from the incident to improve resiliency.</p>
<h2>Best practices</h2>
<p>In addition to following a framework, organizations can also follow these five best practices to improve the resilience of their operations.</p>
<h4>1. Tailor your response plans to attacks specific to your industry</h4>
<p>Not only does that save time and money that would have been spent on low-risk threats, but it allows for more detailed planning for real threats.</p>
<h4>2. Increase visibility and reduce complexity by embracing interoperability</h4>
<p>Using tools that are interoperable increases the effectiveness of security teams by helping them more quickly detect and block attacks.</p>
<h4>3. Invest in technologies to accelerate incident response</h4>
<p>Automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud services are some of the leading ways to increase cyber resiliency. Automation can improve not only operational efficiencies, but also the morale of security teams, which will be able to focus their talents on more meaningful activity and be freed of &#8220;scut work.&#8221;</p>
<h4>4. Bring your security and privacy teams together before serious events occur</h4>
<p>IBM found that companies that exhibited strong cyber-resiliency characteristics recognized the important relationship between these teams. Encouraging collaboration between the teams will improve responsiveness to incidents such as data breaches much more so than if the first time groups collaborate is when they&#8217;re thrown together to face a crisis.</p>
<h4>5. Get the company brass on board</h4>
<p>In all organizations, something is more likely to gain traction if it gets buy-in from the executive team. One way to get the attention of C-level executives and board members is to formalize resiliency reporting to them. That way, resiliency can be kept visible to the upper ranks and receive the resources it needs to preserve the revenues and reputation of the organization.</p>
<h3>Take your SecOps to the next level</h3>
<p>Stan Wisseman, chief security strategist at Micro Focus, said the key is to build on the existing tools and best practices to take your security operations to the next level.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some great guidance out there. There&#8217;s a lot of good work that has already been done to help organizations evolve beyond just cybersecurity.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanwisseman/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stan Wisseman</a></p>

<div>
<p>Agile methodology should be a seamless setup where anytime, tracking of tests per requirement or story, automated or manual tests executed and results available for monitoring or auditing by key stakeholders. And, automation execution shouldn’t be something only techies can do. Non-technical people in the team should know what is being covered in automated tests for stories.</p>
<p>Mature organizations with agile methodologies, implement tooling to centralize, testing, requirements, defects and reporting at one place for better tracking and also to make informed decisions on the software quality management process.</p>
<p>Recently, I have come across two tools, <strong>qTest </strong>and <strong>Applitools </strong>– integrating them in the agile process will solve above challenges and makes testing practise in an agile environment – transparent, traceable, measurable and efficient.</p>

<h2 id="h.5jgitecfokqa"> qTest</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tricentis.com/products/agile-dev-testing-qtest/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tricentis qTest</a> offers a suite of Agile testing tools designed to improve efficiency and ensure collaboration on your journey to release the best software.</p>
<p>qTest has below components to support agile testing methodologies,</p>
<ul>
<li>qTest Manager – Powerful and Easy-to-Use Test Case Management</li>
<li>qTest Launch – Centrally Manage Open Source Frameworks &amp; Commercial Test Automation Tools</li>
<li>qTest Explorer – Test Execution Recorder &amp; Documentation Tools</li>
</ul>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools </a>Visual AI, provides the software industry’s only AI-powered, deep learning, computer vision engine that replicates the human eyes and brain to test rendered components and pages.</p>
<p>Applitools offers incredible efficiency. A single line of capture can replace dozens of text-based assertions per test.  With Applitools, you create tests faster, and you execute tests in seconds on multiple devices/browser combinations. Applitools helps you ensure perfection across all browsers, screens and viewports. You can even include web accessibility compliance testing at the same time.</p>
<p>Applitools has 40+ SDKs for different programming languages and test runners, covering web apps, mobile apps, screenshot testing, PDF validations, and more.</p>
<h2 id="h.piqab7od5109">Applitools Integration with qTest</h2>
<p>How do we combine visual AI in Applitools with Test management capabilities in qTest to make software testing efficient in Agile methodology?</p>
<p>Common flow of test management in any agile environment is,</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing tests to user stories/requirements.</li>
<li>Execute tests manually or automatically.</li>
<li>Raise defects</li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I’m focussing on the automated tests to explain the benefits of qTest and Applitools integration.</p>
<p>qTest supports multiple test runners like TestNG, Cucumber, JBehave, JUnit, NUnit, MSTest etc that can be used with popular tools like Selenium to run automated tests.</p>
<p>Integrating Applitools with the automation tools and test runners is straightforward. Follow <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tutorials</a>  for a step-by-step guide</p>
<p>I have chosen, Cucumber-Java-Selenium and Applitools combination to explain integration.</p>
<p>Cucumber is most commonly used in agile development for writing automated tests.</p>
<p>Cucumber is a BDD(Behavior-Driven Development) software tool which helps facilitate the use of an easy-to-learn language called Gherkin. The Gherkin language is used for writing user stories in a ubiquitous language which can also be parsed by the test runner software. For details of Cucumber and Gherkin language, please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://cucumber.io/docs" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cucumber.io/docs</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a sample Cucumber scenario, as shown below to launch Tricentis website.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Feature: Browser Test
  Scenario: Search qTest Launch
      Given I am on the Tricentis website
      When I search for “qTest Launch”
      Then I should see qTest Launch item on the Search page</pre>
<p>Applitools should be added to the implementation of the Cucumber steps. If the automation framework uses a page object model then Applitools should be added to page objects.</p>
<p>Applitools requires a Selenium webdriver object to capture a screenshot of the application under test.</p>
<p>The following line of code should be added before capturing the DOM screenshot.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">eyes.open(driver, “Demo App”, “Smoke Test”, new RectangleSize(800, 800));</pre>
<p>Next is to add the Applitools check command to take a full-page screenshot.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">// Visual checkpoint #1 - Check the login page.<br/>eyes.checkWindow(“Login Window”);</pre>
<p>**Please refer to this <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/selenium-java.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorial </a>for the remaining steps and completing the integration.</p>
<p>We have successfully added Applitools code to automated tests.</p>
<h2 id="h-running-tests">Running Tests</h2>
<p>Let’s run the automated tests with qTest Launch or CI/CD tools like <strong>Jenkins</strong>.</p>
<p>Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://documentation.tricentis.com/qtest/9910/en/content/qtest_launch/launch_user_guides/qtest_launch_quick_start_guide.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">qTest Launch</a> for more details.</p>
<p>During the test execution, Applitools takes DOM snapshots of the application under test (as shown below) and sends the snapshot to Applitools server for comparison with visual AI – emulating the human eye and brain.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>
<p>Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools</a> for more details.</p>
<p>So far, we have prepared tests and integrated Applitools and now let’s see the results of integration.</p>
<p>qTest automatically imports automation results to qTest Manager dashboard if tests are executed by qTest Launch. Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://documentation.tricentis.com/qtest/od/en/content/qtest_launch/universal_agent_user_guides/universal_agent_overview.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">qTest Launch</a>  for more details.</p>
<p>For execution in Jenkins refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tricentis.com/academy/ondemand-training/how-to-integrate-qtest-jenkins-pipeline-projects/" rel="noopener noreferrer">qTest integrations with Jenkins</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into results imported into qTest Manager as shown below.</p>
<p>Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://documentation.tricentis.com/qtest/od/en/content/qtest_manager/introduction/qtest_manager_quick_start_guides.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">qTest Manager </a>for more details.</p>

<p>qTest Manager dashboard with automation run results.</p>
<p>As shown in the above screenshot, tests are marked passed or failed.</p>
<p>Integrating qTest with Applitools, the advantage is, <strong>qTest marks the test passed or failed depending on the status from Applitools.</strong></p>
<p>Applitools has different status of tests, based on the comparison done by Visual AI.</p>
<p>Please refer to this <a target="_blank" href="https://help.applitools.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007188251-Different-statuses-of-tests-and-steps#:~:text=Unresolved%2D%20A%20test%20which%20has,have%20not%20yet%20been%20reviewed." rel="noopener noreferrer">article </a>for more details.</p>
<p>Let’s click on the test executed and see the details of the execution in both pass and failure scenarios,  </p>
<p><strong>Passed</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>qTest marks the test as <strong>Passed </strong>as Applitools have a taken full-page screenshot of the application and no differences observed with baseline snapshot of the same screen.</li>
<li>Applitools has tested a full-page emulating human eye.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Failed</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>qTest marks the test as <strong>Failed </strong>as Applitools have taken a full-page screenshot of the application and observed differences with the baseline snapshot of the same screen.</li>
<li>Applitools has tested a full-page <strong>emulating human eye </strong>and has found differences that a human eye would visualise by comparing text, images, colour, and contrast.</li>

<ul>
<li>See the progress of given user story testing</li>
<li>Understand what is been tested in automated testing</li>
<li>See the current state of application</li>
<li>Collaborate and take informed decisions</li>
</ul>
<p>Results are available all time in one place for future reference or auditing purposes, giving agile teams transparency and the ability to trace, measure and increase their efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="h.qpf8blko7i92">Benefits of Integration</h2>
<p>In broader terms, Applitools compliments teams using qTest or any other automation tools to,</p>
<ul>
<li>Test faster with less code or zero code – productivity gain by 70%</li>
<li>Cross Browser testing with no infrastructure cost – coverage increase by 90%</li>
<li>Automation results combined at one place – standardising tools</li>
<li>Fewer defects to production – bugs caught 45% more with Visual AI</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope you liked this blog. Keep Testing!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[You have decided to add the power of Selenium automated testing to your testing strategy, but are overwhelmed with how]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>You have decided to add the power of Selenium <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/resources/white-papers/core-elements-of-continuous-testing" rel="noopener noreferrer">automated testing</a> to your testing strategy, but are overwhelmed with how much learning is involved. The Selenium automation framework can be intimidating, and getting started with little to no experience can be a massive undertaking for any organization. The good news is that there is a great way to get started with automated functional testing and it’s not what you would expect: <b>visual testing</b>! </p>
<h3><b>Automated Functional Testing With Visual Testing </b></h3>
<p>In this post, I&#8217;ll take you through how you can use visual testing to detect visual regressions and as a bonus, get automated functional testing out of it too. </p>
<p><b>Prerequisites: </b><a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/platform/visual-testing" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sauce Visual</a><b>, </b><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/screener-io/screener-runner" rel="noopener noreferrer">Screener Runner,</a><b> and Javascript</b></p>
<p>In order to get started, you’ll need the Screener Runner Javascript package and Sauce Visual. I’ll share how using Sauce Visual, our visual testing solution for detecting and reviewing visual changes, can be used to automate visual and functional testing.</p>
<p>We’ll use the interaction testing capabilities provided in the Screener Runner package to perform functional testing, pared-down similar to what Selenium provides.</p>
<div class="image"><picture><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/2wPHATqatrLgz1HSyW4V5h/2e669c5c8ba3421f36b521f066bbbf2f/screener_dashboard.png?fm=webp" type="image/webp"/></picture></div>
<h3><b>Interaction Testing </b></h3>
<p>Screener Runner Interactions can be used for clicking buttons, hovering over elements, setting values, and entering text, which are all used to ensure your components or pages are in their proper visual state for the test. Functional testing through Screener Runner’s Interaction library is useful for testing full web pages, individual components, and complete end-to-end flows.</p>
<p>To use interactions and create your functional tests, Screener Runner provides an API  called Steps. Each Step is an instruction to interact with the website. To see all available Steps, check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/screener-io/screener-runner#testing-interactions" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repo</a>. </p>
<p><b>Example 1: Using screener-runner to capture snapshots of a website</b></p>
<p>This simple test will use screener-runner to load a website and take a snapshot.</p>
<pre><code>module.exports = {
 // full repository name for your project:
 projectRepo: 'mainconfig/stepsTest',
 // this example assumes Environment Variables listed below exist on your system:
 apiKey: process.env.SCREENER_API_KEY,
  states: [
   {
     url: 'https://saucelabs.com/platform/visual-testing',
     name: 'Visual Testing Page'
   }
 ]
 };</code></pre>
<p><b>Example 2: Add interaction steps</b></p>
<p>Taking it up a notch, we’ll add interaction steps for functional flows. This test will load up a demo website, enter a username and password, click the login button, and take a snapshot. </p>
<pre><code>var Steps = require('screener-runner/src/steps');
module.exports = {
 // full repository name for your project:
 projectRepo: 'mainconfig/stepsTest',
 // this example assumes Environment Variables listed below exist on your system:
 apiKey: process.env.SCREENER_API_KEY,
  states: [
   {
     url: 'https://www.saucedemo.com/',
     name: 'Sauce Labs',
     steps: new Steps()
       .setValue('#user-name', 'standard_user') 
       .setValue('#password', 'secret_sauce', {isPassword: true})
       .click('.btn_action')
       .snapshot('signed-in')
       .end()
   },
 ]
};</code></pre>
<p>In the snapshot captured, we can deem the interactions were successful since the image will display an inventory page, which is only visible after entering credentials and clicking the .btn_action button.</p>
<div class="image"><picture><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/LNa3p39oznD1HLfbX8xaR/5686c7ac77be69bf5b08c80c6b706d1b/visualtesting_swaglabs.png?fm=webp" type="image/webp"/><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/LNa3p39oznD1HLfbX8xaR/5686c7ac77be69bf5b08c80c6b706d1b/visualtesting_swaglabs.png" alt="visualtesting swaglabs" title="visualtesting swaglabs" loading="lazy"/></picture></div>
<p><b>Example 3: Additional browsers/resolutions</b></p>
<p>Finally, run visual tests across multiple browsers and mobile resolutions by adding the “browsers” and resolutions” options:</p>
<pre><code>module.exports = {
 ...
 browsers: [
  {
    browserName: 'chrome'
  },
  {
    browserName: 'firefox'
  }
 ],
 resolutions: [
   '1024x768',
   {
     deviceName: 'iPhone X'
   }
 ]
};</code></pre>
<p>More options can be found in our <a target="_blank" href="https://screener.io/v2/docs/test-cross-browser" rel="noopener noreferrer">docs</a> and Screener Runner GitHub <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/screener-io/screener-runner" rel="noopener noreferrer">repo</a>.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Visual Testing</h3>
<p>Just like you would write a functional test to perform a click action, an interaction test is able to check for the same behavior AND take a snapshot of the page to ensure that it visually looks correct—getting a two for one deal!</p>
<p>This means testers no longer have to write and maintain thousands of lines of code to verify if an element is there, reducing the number of assertions. Testers are able to save a lot of time and use automation to purely focus on what a user sees.</p>
<h3>Visual Testing and Screener Runner</h3>
<p>Sauce Visual provides organizations the ability to quickly automate the testing of their web pages across multiple browsers and screen resolutions. It automates detecting visual and functional regressions. When used with Screener Runner, an open-source test runner, users can run lightweight E2E testing with a shortlist of Selenium-like interactions to perform visual tests on components and whole pages. It can be used to test arbitrary URLs and perform simple interactions and capture visual snapshots. </p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>As organizations are starting out and developing their testing strategy, they may want to consider adding visual testing to the list. With a visual testing solution, like Sauce Visual combined with Screener Runner, they’ll be able to run basic functional tests and reap the benefits of visual testing. This will allow them to quickly get up and running while having the coverage that they need.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Building an inclusive work environment, particularly in terms of people with disabilities, is a mental and a cultural shift that has to be part of a company&#8217;s core values and what it wants to drive across the organization, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/sbarutch" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Semra Barutchu</a>, Infosys&#8217; vice president and head of engineering services for Asia.</p>
<p>To that end, Infosys has introduced guidelines to ensure it supports the <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/why-you-should-build-accessibility-start" rel="noopener noreferrer">integration of people with disabilities</a>, and it provides various internal departments with specific information on how to make it easier to integrate these individuals, Barutchu said in the latest INSPIRE 20 podcast.</p>
<h3>The INSPIRE 20 podcast series</h3>
<p>Barutchu is one of the executives taking part in INSPIRE 20, a new podcast series that showcases 20 executives from around the world who are making a difference in terms of inclusion and diversity in their organizations, communities, and/or industries.</p>
<p><iframe allow="autoplay" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/889776454&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no"></iframe> </p>
<p><em>Listen to the podcast with Semra Barutchu on <a target="_blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/inspire-20/id1510305176?i=1000496363343" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Apple Podcasts</a>,<strong> </strong><a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/user-699370465/micro-focus-inspire20-semra-barutchu" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SoundCloud</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5JIUmSImVtwNhck5PDOoWM" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Spotify</a>. Plus: Catch up with all of the <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/inspire-20-podcast-series-tb?_ga=2.169902311.652887837.1600691415-1617140538.1596457935" rel="noopener noreferrer">INSPIRE 20 series podcasts here</a>. </em></p>
<h3>A &#8216;strategic builder&#8217;</h3>
<p>Barutchu joined Infosys in 2013 to lead the engineering business unit across Australia and New Zealand and, subsequently, throughout Asia. She is known as a strategic business builder, specializing in all aspects of engineering services.</p>
<p>Her extensive knowledge and experience of the Asia market allow her to provide expertise in leading regional change programs focused on improving performance, quality, service, and profitability.</p>
<p>Barutchu enjoys promoting careers in information and communications technology to women who may become future leaders in the field. She has volunteered as a committee member for Females in Information Technology for a number of years.</p>
<h3>Driving successful diversity programs</h3>
<p>In the podcast, Barutchu talks about the success Infosys has had when it comes to inclusion and diversity and shares some of the diversity initiatives Infosys is driving in the broader community.</p>
<p>Additionally, Barutchu discusses her role in creating inclusion through social outreach, including her collaboration with the NASSCOM (National Association of Software and Service Companies) Foundation to set up a National Digital Literacy Mission center to empower people with disabilities.</p>
<p>The foundation is NASSCOM&#8217;s social arm that works with the tech industry to achieve social transformation and make an impact through technology in the developing world. The foundation works with the community to encourage and drive inclusion in the community itself, through education as well as by helping people find jobs, or just by creating a more inclusive environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is so much we take for granted that is actually critical for these individuals,&#8221; Barutchu said. &#8220;Unless you&#8217;ve actually lived with people that have various disabilities or you&#8217;re associated with an organization&#8221; that works with people with disabilities, &#8220;you don&#8217;t have an awareness,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>McAfee MVISION Cloud was the first to market with a CASB solution to address the need to secure corporate data in the cloud. Since then, Gartner has published several reports dedicated to the CASB market, which is a testament to the critical role CASBs play in enabling enterprise cloud adoption. Today, Gartner named McAfee a Leader in the 2020 annual <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/lp/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-casb.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB)</a> for the fourth time evaluating CASB vendors.</p>
<p>Cloud access security brokers have become an essential element of any cloud security strategy, helping organizations govern the use of cloud and protect sensitive data in the cloud. Security and risk management leaders concerned about their organizations’ cloud use should investigate CASBs.</p>
<p>In its fourth Magic Quadrant for Cloud Access Security Brokers, Gartner evaluated eight vendors that met its inclusion criteria. MVISION Cloud, as part of the MVISION family of products at McAfee, is recognized as a Leader in the report; and for the fourth year in a row. To learn more about how Gartner assessed the market and MVISION Cloud, download your copy of the report <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/lp/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-casb.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.drupal.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drupal </a>is an open-source content management system used to build websites and applications. Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need. In this article, we’ll show you how to effectively test Drupal websites and applications using cutting edge vision based technology.</p>
<h3 id="h.aid1r6pznvc2">Why do people prefer Drupal over other Open Source CMS’s?</h3>
<ul>
<li> Reliability and scalability </li>
<li> Security </li>
<li> Easing out the complexity of the site </li>
<li>It is multilingual </li>
<li>Flexibility of Drupal</li>
<li>Easy for SEO</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vardot.com/en-us/ideas/blog/why-drupal-best-cms-your-website" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.vardot.com/en-us/ideas/blog/why-Drupal-best-cms-your-website</a> for more information on above.</p>
<p>The digital landscape is changing, and with it are increasing demands on content management systems (CMSes) and organisations to keep pace with consumer needs. Users are demanding more personalised <a target="_blank" href="https://www.origineight.net/o8dx?__hstc=39244668.dd7233d964b6f2f7cd114bc5000b2b0e.1599367142010.1599367142010.1599367142010.1&amp;__hssc=39244668.1.1599367142011&amp;__hsfp=2647981047" rel="noopener noreferrer">experiences</a>, more excellent connectivity between devices, and more interactive elements in their web experiences.</p>
<p>Organisations want websites that grow with your digital technology and business needs and help you achieve your goals. Drupal is helping organisations to meet these demands.</p>
<h2 id="h.mj1qmrxtnkw2">How do we test Drupal-powered websites?</h2>
<p>Drupal provides enormous benefits for building customer experience and at the same times poses challenges for testing also.</p>
<p>Drupal sites are full of content, and variations to the content can cause below issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantity of content</li>
<li>Length of the content</li>
<li>Interlinking between content</li>
<li>Different types of media</li>
<li>Language</li>
<li>Formatting</li>
</ul>
<p>If a website includes a content import component, doing this at the beginning of a project is a great way to ensure that real content is tested as the site’s functionality is built.</p>
<p>For user-generated content, creating a suite of realistic test content that includes a variety of what users might enter is an excellent investment of time at the beginning of the project.</p>
<p>Most organisations assume Drupal handles below areas automatically, or they will “just work”.</p>
<ul>
<li>Responsive web testing</li>
<li>Compatible with dynamic content</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Support multilingual</li>
<li>Performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Drupal developers are performing a quick check on one browser(mostly chrome) during development and assume testing team or content management team will be able to check other browser and device combinations before releasing to customers.</p>
<p>Organisations are increasingly writing scripted tests with tools like Selenium, and Cypress etc. can be repeated and tested frequently to cover above requirements. Areas of testing like usability, design features are challenging to test in a scripted fashion. Exploratory testing(manual) done by developers or content management teams will not be able to catch all issues.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote">

<p>“Areas of testing like usability, design features are challenging to test in a scripted fashion. Exploratory testing(manual) done by developers or content management teams will not be able to catch all issues.”</p>
</blockquote>
</figure>
<p>The best approach is to have a solution that can help Drupal developers to quickly validate the changes and authoring team(content changed) validated across all aspects of user experience.</p>
<h2 id="h.z7h2iiadxgkr">Testing Drupal with Visual AI</h2>
<p>Applitools Visual AI is an option to explore that has capabilities to overcome some of the challenges. Let’s see in detail on Applitools, and it’s capabilities.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools </a>Visual AI, the industries only AI-powered, deep learning, computer vision that replicates the human eyes and brain.</p>
<p>Through Visual AI, comes incredible efficiency allowing tests to be created faster, tests executed in seconds on devices/browser combinations ensuring perfection across all browsers, screens and viewports combined with web accessibility compliance testing at the same time.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example to discuss testing a website built with Drupal.</p>
<p>I have taken <a target="_blank" href="https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/</a> website built on Drupal and using Selenium Java for testing the responsive web design, accessibility and functionality with Applitools.</p>
<p>Refer to the <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/tutorials/selenium-java.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applitools – Selenium –</a>Tutorial for step by step guide to writing/execute the test.</p>
<p>Test completed in <strong>24 secs testing full-page( top to bottom) on 49 viewport and screen sizes.</strong></p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"></figure>
</div>
<p>The test is executed on Desktop and device browser combinations as shown below,</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1001" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4.png" alt="pasted image 0 4" class="wp-image-24164" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4.png 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4-300x188.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4-1024x641.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4-768x480.png 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4-1536x961.png 1536w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-4-335x211.png 335w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
</div>
<p>Regression testing on the same page is executed on all the same combinations covering desktop and mobile devices. Here full-page is compared with the previous run, and Visual AI has validated below on the page using Strict Algorithm,</p>
<ul>
<li>Text</li>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Color &amp; Contrast</li>
<li>Position and alignment</li>
</ul>
<p>Applitools Visual AI has multiple <a target="_blank" href="https://applitools.com/automated-visual-testing-best-practices-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer">algorithms </a>that can be used for validating different use cases.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>
<p>Visual AI comparison can be used to validate the look and feel of a particular component, element or region of a page.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="848" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2.png" alt="pasted image 0 2" class="wp-image-24160" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2.png 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-300x159.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1024x543.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-768x407.png 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1536x814.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
<p>Now, what if there are differences on the UI after dev changes. Wouldn’t it be great to know the reason for the difference? Applitools platform has “Root Cause Analysis” that provides the root cause as shown below,</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="863" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2.jpg" alt="pasted image 0 2" class="wp-image-24158" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2.jpg 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-300x162.jpg 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1024x552.jpg 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-768x414.jpg 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1536x828.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
</div>
<p>At the same time, while we are testing the UI, what if we get to know the website has met the accessibility guidelines or not without writing a line of code? See below.</p>
<p>Applitools Visual AI validates the screen elements and provides a status of accessibility.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="890" src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1.jpg" alt="pasted image 0 2 1" class="wp-image-24159" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1.jpg 1600w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1-300x167.jpg 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1-1024x570.jpg 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1-768x427.jpg 768w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pasted-image-0-2-1-1536x854.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"/></figure>
</div>
<p>What’s next after this, testers validate the results and accept/reject the latest screenshot with a click of a button.</p>
<p>Here are other capabilities that the Applitools platform provides to help in End to End development of Drupal sites,</p>
<h3 id="h.oxxy6i5crc1g">Benefits of Testing Drupal with Applitools</h3>

Sauce Performance is a performance testing tool that allows developers to test the front-end performance of applications in the Sauce platform at no additional cost. Rather than testing performance at the end of the testing cycle with a third party application, Sauce users can test the front-end performance of their application at the beginning of the testing cycle. </p>
<h3>How to Get Sauce Performance Setup with Selenium Tests</h3>
<p>Sauce Performance is set up with machine learning-derived baselines with Google Lighthouse (recently updated to version 6) and a front-end audit and history. You can begin the process of creating performance tests by leveraging existing Selenium tests as well. While this shouldn’t be your process every time, it can be a very easy way to get started.</p>
<p>In this example below, you can see how to start capturing web application performance for existing Selenium tests: </p>
<div class="image"><picture><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/czwjnyf8a9ri/6fAgRJvLDJprYI8ZNzOhHG/89f8ccaa09241afe788e4a295b38131f/performance_selenium.png?fm=webp" type="image/webp"/></picture></div>
<p>Sauce Performance is currently only available for tests executed on the latest three versions of Google Chrome. </p>
<p>While many testers might want to use their current Selenium tests, there are also some other best practices to follow to ensure you are getting the best results from your performance tests.</p>
<h3>General Best Practices for Sauce Performance </h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Separate performance and functional tests: </b>As front end performance tests serve a different objective than functional tests, you want to separate them from GUI tests and make them a separate step in your CI pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Run performance tests on only a single operating system: </b>Typically, users see more predictable results when running tests against Chrome on a single dedicated OS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Choose metrics that align with your application/user needs: </b>Sauce Performance allows users to validate front-end performance regressions across a wide range of metrics (Performance Score, Time to Interactive, Time to First Meaningful Paint, etc.). We recommend exploring verifications across a mix of metrics that closely align with the most important desired end-user experiences you wish to achieve. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Optimize your scripts for performance: </b>While Sauce Performance is able to validate metrics/regressions around page loads, users should be aware of other actions the test script is performing (e.g., assertions for the presence of content on the page) and determine if they are necessary in gathering performance metrics. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Focus on core app experiences first: </b>Performance testing and validations should focus on core application experiences as a start. Prioritize your performance validations the same as you would your frontend functional tests—test key pages more frequently. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these best practices, getting Sauce Performance up and running with your Sauce account is easy and efficient. Once Sauce Performance is integrated into your pipeline, your team will be able to have a single quality signal for your functional and performance tests getting you one step closer to feeling digitally confident.</p>
<h3>Test Performance for Yourself!</h3>
<p>Sauce Performance is now enabled across the entire Sauce Labs platform and you can even access it on the free trial. Go ahead and give it a try on our<a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/sign-up" rel="noopener noreferrer"> free trial</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://saucelabs.com/sales" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact us</a> to learn more about the Sauce platform.</p>
