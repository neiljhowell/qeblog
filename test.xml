										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<p>Several weeks ago, we sat down with Thai Pangsakulyanont, who was one of the Applitools Visual AI Rockstar Hackathon winners, about his experiences in the Hackathon and what he took away from the experience.</p>
<p>Thai Pangsakulyanont is a front-end architect working for <a target="_blank" href="https://taskworld.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taskworld</a> in Bangkok, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thailand</a>. He has eight years of testing experience, including six with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h.bpkvgnq732wu">Starting Point</h2>
<p>At Taskworld, Thai said, they make and sell a productivity/project management web application.</p>
<p>The stack is mostly JavaScript.  For their end-to-end testing, they use their own test runner, called Prescript. They use prescript in conjunction with Selenium and “expect” assertions.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>
<p>Thai said he has six years of experience with Selenium, using both Javascript and Ruby. He had no prior experience with Applitools, but he did have prior experience with other image diffing programs.  For instance, he was using Javascript image processing for comparing images as an experiment and part of his side project.</p>
<h2 id="h.dgg4idiz3yla">Applitools Pre-Hackathon Expectations and Experience</h2>
<p>Having used percy.io previously Thai expected something like a visual diff tool. He knows he can use percy for visual diffs and visual regression testing.</p>
<p>What he didn’t expect in Applitools were the internal tools for communication inside the Applitools UI to help communicate his findings to teammates. He really liked the productivity aspects of Applitools.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/653686.png" alt="653686" class="wp-image-18502" srcset="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/653686.png 1277w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/653686-300x143.png 300w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/653686-1024x489.png 1024w, https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/653686-768x367.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1277px) 100vw, 1277px"/></figure>
<p>He had a little bit of trouble getting started with branching. Thai had prior experience with gitbranch, and he expected Applitools to behave similarly. It took him a while to get the behaivor the way he expected, but he figured it out.</p>
<p>Thai realized how easy he found it to run visual regression testing with Applitools Visual AI.</p>
<p>Working on the Hackathon, Thai realized the number of test cases that he could not cover with traditional assertions. For example, an icon disappearing can still show up in the DOM, even if it disappears for the user.  He generally wouldn’t write a test to see if a button had moved, and that kind of test comes for free when using Visual AI</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://applitools.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-13-at-12.15.01-PM-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-18501"/></figure>
<p>Thai realized the number of cases that Visual AI could cover that his traditional assertion-based testing would miss.</p>
<h2 id="h.g6horq3t0hu2">Ideas For Improvement</h2>
<p>Thai’s big takeaways come from his perspective as an architect by day and running his own development projects in non-work hours. Thai likes to experiment, which explains how an architect got involved in a Visual AI hackathon. He liked the idea of learning something new.</p>
<p>While Thai figured out the Github integration, he’d love it to be easier (something we continue to improve). He loved a lot of the other collaboration capabilities inside Applitools.  </p>
<p>Thai works constantly to improve his productivity. As a contributor to open-source projects, Thai likes working with open-source tools. He has worked on several projects. As a coder, he discovered that the more code he wrote in a project the more likely he would write bugs. He picked up testing skills to help catch bugs in his own code.  </p>
<p>To help improve open-source projects, Thai said he could see the use of an open-source version of Applitools as a testing solution. He would love to have an open-source solution that would allow him to share with other developers in an open-source dashboard that didn’t require a login. Such a dashboard would give coding teams visibility into bug impact from different code additions.</p>
<h2 id="h.jwq1bjjb1zt2">Takeaways</h2>
<p>Overall, Thai enjoyed his experience working on the Hackathon.</p>
<p><em>Thai Pangsakulyanont won a Platinum award for his experience in the Applitools hackathon.</em></p>
<h2 id="h.8r9qta3rrm0t">For More Information</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
<br /></p>
<div>
<p>Despite a significant uptick in awareness of DevOps security issues, many companies aren&#8217;t on top of the software development security challenges they face, and must rely on outside teams to handle their software security program. </p>
<p>Surveys show that there is significant resistance to<a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/primer-secure-devops-why-devsecops-matters" rel="noopener noreferrer"> company-wide DevSecOps implementations</a>, and that many managers view incorporating security standards into DevOps processes as a roadblock to agile software delivery.</p>
<p>Why the negative attitude toward DevSecOps rollouts with so many software managers? For starters, many DevOps professionals <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-bridge-security-development-divide" rel="noopener noreferrer">don’t want to sacrifice speedy application development</a> and deployment for a secure environment, complete with the frequent testing and tracking that comes with DevSecOps.</p>
<p>Another factor is that many software managers don&#8217;t understand how to properly <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/what-your-devops-team-needs-know-4-lessons-exploited-vulnerabilities" rel="noopener noreferrer">implement a security program into their DevOps programs</a>. That’s why many organizations are continuing to struggle with implementing security standards in their DevOps platforms.</p>
<p>For software development managers who want to get off the fence and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/state-of-application-security-testing-tb/shift-security-left-continuous-testing?lx=QKJph-&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">improve their security effectiveness</a>, the best incentive may be to check out what happens when you <em>don&#8217;t</em> deploy a DevSecOps security program. Here&#8217;s a closer look.</p>
<p><em>[ Continuous delivery and release automation (CDRA) demands speed and quality. Find out how in <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/continuous-delivery-release-automation-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechBeacon&#8217;s guide to CDRA</a>.

<h3>Reputational damage gets real</h3>
<p>Fewer customers want to do business with a company that doesn&#8217;t take data security seriously, and even fewer employees want to work for that company.</p>
<p>Case in point: In 2015, UK-based TalkTalk suffered a data breach that compromised the personal data of 157,000 customers, and exposed the bank records of 20,000 of them. </p>
<p>When the UK’s Information Commissioner Office <a target="_blank" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/talktalk-fine-data-breach-theft-customers-information-stolen-record-penalty-a7346316.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">cited the company for &#8220;multiple failings&#8221;</a> in its security processes, the broadband provider <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/talktalk-hack-customers-lost" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">lost 100,000 customers</a>—and a big chunk of its information technology team, many of whom were too embarrassed to work at the company any longer.</p>
<p>Brand distancing often happens in the aftermath of a major data hack, and not implementing stronger security measures is a major reason why reputational damage is so severe. Bugs linger, and product rollouts get delayed.</p>
<p>One of the most significant benefits from having a solid DevSecOps program is that your software security teams, usually through repeated testing, can identify system vulnerabilities early and fix them in time. That means little or no delay in software rollouts and software projects that come in clean.</p>
<h3>Security and speed: You <em>can</em> have both</h3>
<p>If you don&#8217;t spot system vulnerabilities early in the DevOps process, all that time spent on agile software coding and development can go for naught. Not only are deadlines threatened, but new or revamped company products and services—the bread and butter of any business—are delayed.</p>
<p>This costs the company staffing time (to fix the vulnerabilities while plugging the pipeline) and money (in the form of delayed orders and delayed payments from vendors, partners, and customers).</p>
<p>Your software developers already have plenty to do when creating and installing functionality for your products, yet one of the strongest tenets of DevSecOps is the increased data security knowledge that those software developers gain as key members of a data software security team.</p>
<p>With DevSecOps, software developers are on the front lines of data security, fully trained on the security side of software builds and capable of spotting coding errors as they happen. </p>
<p>In the end, you’ve got not only a seasoned software developer who knows how to generate code and push deadlines through to the end, but also a curious and plugged-in data software system specialist who can help save you time and money down the road, as your DevOps program expands and the stakes grow higher for your company.</p>
<p>You run the risk of financial and legal liability. No savvy company decision makers should ignore DevSecOps, considering the <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/32-application-security-stats-matter" rel="noopener noreferrer">huge costs associated with breaches</a>. Instead, they should think about investing in cost-saving DevSecOps training, testing, and implementation.</p>
<p><em>[ Learn <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/optimize-devops-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">the secrets of successful DevOps initiatives</a> in TechBeacon’s Guide.

<h3>Ignore DevSecOps at your own risk</h3>
<p>The downsides associated with avoiding software security practices can be measured far beyond the most pervasive issues I&#8217;ve cited above—brand damage and legal and compliance costs among them.</p>
<p>Rather than simply accepting these risks, get proactive and go full throttle with a software security plan that takes all of the above issues off the table—for good.</p>

<p><strong>Seven flaws in Thunderbolt</strong> ports let an attacker fully access data on recent PCs and some Macs. Is this just fantasy?</p>
<p><strong>The bugs bypass</strong> Intel’s security controls, so malefactors can decrypt drives with ease. Didn’t mean to make you cry.</p>
<p><strong>And the researchers threw shade</strong> on Intel for its response to their disclosure. Sends shivers down my spine.</p>
<p><strong>However, the attack isn’t trivial to pull off.</strong> In this week’s <i><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/contributors/richi-jennings" rel="noopener noreferrer">Security Blogwatch</a></i>, we see a little silhouetto <a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/security/what-your-devops-team-needs-know-4-lessons-exploited-vulnerabilities" rel="noopener noreferrer">of a vuln</a>.</p>

<h3>IOMMU, Figaro!</h3>
<p><strong>What’s the craic?</strong> Andy Greenberg reports—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/story/thunderspy-thunderbolt-evil-maid-hacking/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer" title="read the full text">Thunderbolt Flaws Expose Millions of PCs to Hands-On Hacking</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Security researchers have long been wary of Intel&#8217;s Thunderbolt interface as a potential security issue. … On Thunderbolt-enabled Windows or Linux PCs manufactured before 2019, [Thunderspy] can bypass the login screen of a sleeping or locked computer—and even its hard disk encryption—to gain full access to the computer&#8217;s data.<br />…<br />It leaves no trace of intrusion and can be pulled off in just a few minutes. … There&#8217;s no easy software fix. [It’s] both unpatched and unpatchable for millions of computers.<br />…<br />The fact that Thunderbolt remains a viable attack method for evil maids isn&#8217;t entirely unexpected, says Karsten Nohl, a well-known hardware security researcher. … Still, he was surprised to see how easily Intel&#8217;s &#8220;security levels&#8221; can be bypassed.<br />…<br />Users may want to disable their Thunderbolt port altogether in their computer&#8217;s BIOS … enable hard disk encryption, and turn their computers off entirely when they leave them unattended.</em></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><em>The new attack, discovered by Eindhoven University of Technology researcher Björn Ruytenberg, [allows] attackers to steal information from any vulnerable Thunderbolt-enabled device. … &#8220;All systems released before 2019, and more recent systems that do not ship Kernel DMA Protection, will remain fully vulnerable to Thunderspy forever,&#8221; the researcher explains.<br />…<br />For Linux and Windows users, all systems purchased before 2019 are vulnerable … while devices bought during and after 2019 might [be]. Macs from 2011 and older, except for Retina MacBooks, are all impacted.<br />…<br />Intel confirmed that the vulnerabilities are valid but [can] not mitigate the Thunderspy vulnerabilities by issuing a patch [as it] would require a silicon redesign.</em></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><em>We have found 7 vulnerabilities in Intel’s design and developed 9 realistic scenarios how these could be exploited by a malicious entity to get access to your system, past the defenses that Intel had set up for your protection. … Thunderspy enables creating arbitrary … device identities and cloning user-authorized … devices, even in the presence of Security Levels pre-boot protection and cryptographic device authentication.<br />…<br />Our research has found the following vulnerabilities:<br /> </em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Inadequate firmware verification schemes </em></li>
<li><em>Weak device authentication scheme </em></li>
<li><em>Use of unauthenticated device metadata </em></li>
<li><em>Downgrade attack using backwards compatibility </em></li>
<li><em>Use of unauthenticated controller configurations </em></li>
<li><em>SPI flash interface deficiencies </em></li>
<li><em>No Thunderbolt security on Boot Camp</em></li>
</ol>
<p><em>These vulnerabilities lead to nine practical exploitation scenarios.<br />…<br />We disclosed vulnerabilities 1-5 to Intel on February 10. They wrote on March 10 … that vulnerabilities 3-5 were new to them. After further research we disclosed vulnerability 6, which Intel confirmed on March 17. … We informed Apple of vulnerability 7 on April 17.<br />…<br />In our first email we asked Intel to promptly notify affected parties, in coordination with us. However, Intel did not take any action and finally, after several email exchanges, listed only 5 parties whom they would inform. We then sent them a list of other parties we had identified as affected, including 11 OEMs/ODMs and the Linux kernel security team. Eventually they notified us that they informed some parties on 25 March about the vulnerabilities and upcoming disclosure, without giving us details of what this information consisted of and whom exactly they contacted. We reached out to several more parties after realizing that they had been skipped by Intel.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Yikes, Intel.</strong> Jerry Bryant puts on his big-boy PR pants—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://blogs.intel.com/technology/2020/05/more-information-on-thunderspy/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer" title="read the full text">More Information on Thunderbolt<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Security</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>In February 2020, researchers from Eindhoven University of Technology … discussed issues related to invasive physical attacks on Thunderbolt<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> hosts and devices. While the underlying vulnerability is not new and was addressed in operating system releases last year, the researchers demonstrated new potential physical attack vectors using a customized peripheral device on systems that did not have these mitigations enabled.<br />…<br />We thank the researchers from Eindhoven University for reporting this to us.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Wait, so “nothing to see here”?</strong> Shaun Nichols mocks—<i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/05/11/thunderspy_port_hack/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer" title="read the full text">Incredible how you can steal data via Thunderbolt once you&#8217;ve taken the PC apart, attached a flash programmer, rewritten the firmware&#8230;</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Let&#8217;s be frank: This is, for most people, more of a neat trick than infosec Armageddon. A miscreant would need to have physical access to the machine long enough to unscrew the case, attach an SPI flash programmer with an SOP8 clip to rewrite the Thunderbolt port controller&#8217;s firmware to unlock access, and then attach a device to the interface to copy data via PCIe and DMA through the port, and then, if necessary, flash back the original firmware and fit the computer back together.<br />…<br />It&#8217;s not bad news if your threat model already assumed physical access was a game-over scenario. It&#8217;s not something that can be exploited over the internet or network, or by malware running on your PC or Mac.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Similarly,</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=16354758&amp;cid=60048432" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer" title="read the full text">thereddaikon</a></i> eyerolls furiously:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>This shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise or revelation to anyone. It&#8217;s a natural consequence of DMA. The whole point is to access system memory without having to go through the CPU and reduce overhead.<br />…<br />It&#8217;s an explicit and intentional feature. DMA support allows Thunderbolt to act as external PCIe. Without it eGPU and other accessories wouldn&#8217;t be possible.<br />…<br />[If] the attacker can physically access the machine, don&#8217;t let them do it. If they can lay hands on the device you have already lost. That&#8217;s rule #1 of security.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Um, okay.</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://forums.theregister.co.uk/forum/all/2020/05/11/thunderspy_port_hack/#c_4030306" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer" title="read the full text">doublelayer</a></i> offers a more nuanced view:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>While it&#8217;s not useless, it only works in a relatively small number of cases. And in many of those cases, there is a more direct method of getting access.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good reminder to those who are concerned about an attacker of that level of skill and determination to avoid suspending to memory, but that has been known for some time.</p>
<p></em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>So just epoxy up the TB port?</strong> Careful with that ax, <i><a target="_blank" href="https://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=16354758&amp;cid=60047928" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer" title="read the full text">Junta</a>:</i></p>
<blockquote><p><em>On some laptops the only charging ports are Thunderbolt ports. So you have to leave the port available or your laptop won&#8217;t be able to recharge.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>But</strong> <i><a target="_blank" href="https://forums.theregister.co.uk/forum/all/2020/05/11/thunderspy_port_hack/#c_4030967" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer" title="read the full text">HildyJ</a></i> has a better use for said glue:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The need to protect sensitive data has two main drivers, privacy legislation and protection of intellectual property against external breaches]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />
</p>
<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
							
						</div>
<p>The need to protect sensitive data has two main drivers, privacy legislation and protection of intellectual property against external breaches and insider threat. 58% of the countries worldwide now have legislation in place; these will become more onerous over time.  Breaches and insider theft of data is a frequently reported topic in the media due to the steady stream of brand impacting, high-profile cases.  Breaches are expensive due to fines, loss of revenue and remediation costs.</p>
<p>Historically data protection via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/security-awareness/data-protection/dlp-best-practices.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">DLP</a> was implemented on the end point and in the business’s network.  Both approaches have strengths and weaknesses; network DLP is unable to monitor the movement of sensitive data to USB memory sticks and end point DLP doesn’t offer some of the more sophisticated DLP capabilities that require a lot of memory and compute power.  Many customers deployed both enterprise DLP solutions.</p>
<p>Other vendors without enterprise DLP offerings have added “DLP-lite” capabilities to their products, predominantly email and web security products and some businesses have chosen those over enterprise DLP solutions.</p>
<p>This approach was sustainable before widespread adoption of the cloud.  95% of companies have or are adopting cloud services and 79% of them admit to storing sensitive data there.  Data is now everywhere, on laptops, servers, in sanctioned apps, in unsanctioned Shadow IT apps and moving from cloud to cloud.  Protecting data within the four walls of an organization is no longer sufficient.</p>
<p>Businesses, particularly those with a Cloud First strategy have responded to this challenge by introducing a CASB solution such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products/mvision-cloud.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee’s MVISION Cloud</a> product.  Dependent on the product this can address some, or all, of these cloud adoption challenges – MVISION Cloud addresses them all.</p>
<p>The problem however is that some businesses are living with gaps in their protection as they don’t deploy multiple products.  Endpoint DLP can’t solve for cloud, neither can cloud DLP solve for endpoint and web DLP can’t effectively solve for sanctioned apps allowing online collaboration, or endpoint.  When looking at common use cases along with potential DLP leak vectors you’ll appreciate why a single product isn’t a complete solution:</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-100958 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-2.png" alt="" width="936" height="492" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-2.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-2-300x158.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-2-768x404.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-2-205x108.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"/></p>
<p>To attempt to address this, businesses deploy multiple products.  Doing so closes all the gaps but has downsides.  Multiple products are expensive to license, have higher IT management overheads and complexity due to subtly implementations.  These differences are due to different DLP policies, data classifications and content extraction engines which makes it difficult to ensure consistency of detection across products, as data classifications that have been fine-tuned over time have to be re-implemented from scratch with each additional product, leading to a reduction of efficacy.</p>
<p>McAfee’s Unified Cloud Edge (UCE) solution solves these problems.  UCE is a combination of endpoint DLP, web SaaS proxy and CASB, covering all the potential data leak vectors: endpoint, unsanctioned shadow IT apps, sanctioned apps (including email) and cloud to cloud transfers.  UCE is managed via a single console and uses the same DLP technology everywhere, such as policy and content extraction engines to maximize efficacy through consistent results.  Businesses can retain their investment in those carefully crafted data classifications, allowing use across all vectors and easy extension to the cloud.  UCE is a cloud native, highly scalable solution with industry leading uptime and availability.</p>

<p>Do you believe in learning from the experiences of others? If others found themselves more productive adding Visual AI to their functional tests, would you give it a try?</p>



<p>In November 2019, over 3,000 engineers signed up to participate in the Applitools Visual AI Rockstar Hackathon. 288 completed the challenge and submitted tests – comparing their use of coded test validation versus the same tests using Visual AI. They found themselves with better coverage, faster test development, more stable test code, with easier code test code maintenance.</p>

<p>On April 23, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameslamberti/" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Lamberti</a>, CMO at Applitools, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajaraodv/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raja Rao</a> DV, Director of Growth Marketing at Applitools, discussed the findings from the Applitools Hackathon submissions. The 288 engineers who submitted their test code for evaluation by the Hackathon team spent an average of 11 hours per submission. That’s over 3,000 person-hours – the equivalent of  1 ½ years of engineering work.</p>

In the other version, the new candidate, the page rendered with errors. This would simulate the real-world issues of dealing with test maintenance as apps develop new functionality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hackathon participants had to write code that did the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Ensure the page rendered as expected on the baseline.</li><li>Capture all mistakes in the page rendering on the new candidate</li><li>Report on all the differences between the baseline and the new candidate</li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Also, Hackathon participants needed to realize that finding a single error on a page met the necessary – but not sufficient condition for testing. A single test that captures all the problems at once has a faster resolution time than running into multiple bug capture/fix loops. Test engineers needed to write tests that captured all the test conditions, as well as properly reporting all the failures.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hackathon participants would code their test using a conventional test runner plus assertions of results in the output DOM. Then, they used the same test runner code but replaced all their assertions with Applitools Visual AI comparisons.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hackathon participants found an identical page to the tests in Case 1 – but they were responsible for handling the different responses to each of the different test conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, the coding for the conventional test required entering the test conditions via test runner asserting all the elements on the page, including asserting error messages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, the question was left open for testers – what should they test when they test the valid password and username condition? The simplest answer – just make sure the app visits the correct target post-login page. But, more advanced testers wanted to make sure that the target paged rendered as expected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, again, the comparison with coded assertions and adding Visual AI makes clear how much more easily Visual AI captures baselines and then compares the new candidate against the baselines.</p>

<p>To test table sorting with conventional assertion code, Hackathon participants had to write code that captured all the data in the table, performed the appropriate sort of that data, and use the internally-sorted table in the test code with the sorted table on the web page. Great test coders took pains to ensure that they had done this well and could handle various sorting options.  The winners took time to ensure that their code covered the table behavior. This complex behavior did not get caught by all participants, even with a decent amount of effort.  </p>

<p>Interestingly, the prize-winning submitters spent, on average 10.2 hours writing their winning submissions. They wrote more thorough conventional tests, which would yield accurate coverage when failures did occur. On the other hand, their coverage did not match the complete-page coverage they got from Visual  AI. And, their prize-winning Visual AI tests required, on average, six minutes more to write than the average of the whole of the test engineers.</p>

<p>The next takeaway came from calculating coding efficiency. For conventional tests, the average participant wrote about 350 lines of code. The prize winners, whose code had greater coverage, wrote a little more than 450 lines of code, on average. This correlates with the 7 hours and 10 hours of time spent writing tests.  It’s not a perfect measure, but participants writing conventional tests wrote about 50 lines of code per hour over 7 hours, and the top winners wrote about 45 lines of code per hour over 10 hours.</p>

<p>Most software engineers realize that labels and other element locators get created by software developers – who can change locators due to intentional change or unanticipated difference. And element locator using Xpath can suddenly discover the wrong relative locator due to an enhancement. The same is true for labels, which can change between releases – even when there is no visible user behavior difference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No one wants testing to overconstrain development. No one wants development to remain ignorant of testing needs. And yet, because mistakes sometimes happen, or changes are sometimes necessary, locators and labels change – resulting in test code that no longer works properly.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Interestingly, when evaluating conventional tests, the average Hackathon participant used 34 labels and locators, while the Hackathon prize winners used 47 labels and locators.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, for the Visual AI tests, the average participant used 9 labels and locators, while the winning submissions used only 8. At a conservative measure, Visual AI reduces the dependency of code on external factors – we calculate it at 3.8 x more stable.</p>

<h3 id="h.xvx3dix29aty">Catching Bugs Early</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Visual AI can catch bugs early in coding cycles.  Because Visual AI depends on the rendered representations and not on the code to be rendered, Visual AI will catch visual differences that might be missed by the existing test code. For instance, think of an assertion for the contents of a text box. In this new release, the test passes because the box has the same text. However, the box width has been cut in half, causing the text to extend outside the box boundary and be obscured. The test passes, but in reality it fails. The test assumed a condition that is no longer true.</p>

<p>Visual AI catches these differences. It will catch changes that result in different functional behavior that requires new coding. It will catch changes – like the one described above, that result in visual differences that impact users. And, it will avoid flagging changes that may change the DOM but not the view or behavior from the user’s perspective.</p>

<h3 id="h.dd003mtbnl0">Easier to Learn than Code-Based Testing</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last thing James shared involved the learning curve for users. In general, we assumed that test coverage and score on the Hackathon evaluation correlated with participant coding skill. The average score achieved by all testers using conventional code-based assertions was 79%. After taking a 90-minute online course on Visual AI through Test Automation University, the average score for Visual AI testers was 88%.</p>

<p>Because people don’t use visual capture every day, testers need to learn how to think about applying visual testing. But, once the participants had just a little training, they wrote more comprehensive and more accurate tests, and they learned how to run those test evaluations in Applitools.</p>

<h2 id="h.cgiwnz8k92bd">What This Means For You</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>James and Raja reiterated the benefits they outlined in their webinar: faster test creation, more coverage, code efficiency, code stability, early bug catching and ease of learning. Then they asked: what does this mean for you?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you use text-based assertions for your end-to-end tests, you might find clear, tangible benefits from using Visual AI in your product release flow. It integrates easily into your CICD or other development processes. It can augment existing tests, not requiring any kind of rip and replace.  Real, tangible benefits come to many companies that deploy Visual AI. What is stopping you?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In March 2019, an online intruder discovered that cloud storage used by financial giant Capital One suffered from a vulnerability]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p>
<div>
<p>In March 2019, an online intruder discovered that cloud storage used by financial giant Capital One suffered from a vulnerability in the firm&#8217;s application firewall and storage servers, allowing the attacker to send commands from one to the other.</p>
<p>The exploitation of the vulnerability—<a target="_blank" href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">an issue known as server-side request forgery (SSRF)</a>—resulted in the leaking of sensitive personal information on more than 106 million individuals in the United States and Canada. Capital One had misconfigured its web application firewall, failing to prevent privileged access to the company&#8217;s cloud storage server hosted on Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>This class of vulnerability was well understood and easy to exploit. It should have been a priority to fix. But the takeaway from this incident is how easy missing an important security flaw can be, said Frank Kim, instructor and curriculum lead at the SANS Institute, a technical training organization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Even Capital One, a leader in DevOps security, makes mistakes. There are so many vulnerabilities, and companies are trying to push out so much functionality. We need to be able to close the window of vulnerability more quickly.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/fykim" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Frank Kim</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most companies are doing <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/build-appsec-dev-tb/appsec-best-practices?lx=a0uQni&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">credible jobs of finding and fixing vulnerabilities in code</a>, ensuring deployed servers are not misconfigured, and putting defenses in place to protect networks and data. The problem, however, is that a single misconfiguration can have massive repercussions. SSRF, for example, is a well-understood class of vulnerabilities, but such attacks are hard to mitigate on cloud services, and protections did not exist a year ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;As we know about DevOps, it is not just the technology when we are talking about the vulnerabilities, it is the process and the technology. We can&#8217;t just throw all these tools at the DevOps teams, because even though we say developers should do more security, their incentives—getting functional code out as quickly as possible—have not changed.&#8221;<br />—Frank Kim</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In November, eight months after the breach, Amazon <a target="_blank" href="https://duo.com/decipher/aws-adds-new-protections-against-ssrf-other-web-app-attacks" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">implemented protections against such attacks</a>.</p>
<p>Massive breaches are often caused by simple vulnerabilities that developers, operations, and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/build-appsec-dev-tb/appsec-strategies?lx=a0uQni&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">application-security teams have missed</a>. Here are four lessons from major breaches on how to catch the next seemingly small software bug before it snowballs into a massive breach.</p>
<p><em>[ The shift is on to secure code. Get up to speed with <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/state-of-application-security-testing-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechBeacon&#8217;s State of App Sec Guide</a>. Plus: Get the <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/state-of-application-security-testing-tb/gartner-magic-quadrant-appsec-testing?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner 2020 Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing</a> ]</em></p>
<h3>1. Know your assets</h3>
<p>On March 6, 2017, the Apache Foundation released a patch for a vulnerability (<a target="_blank" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5638" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CVE-2017-5638</a>) in Apache Struts 2, which allows attackers to execute commands using a specially crafted header HTTP header. Four days later, attackers used the flaw to scan servers at credit-reporting agency Equifax, compromising a key server there. From May to July, attackers returned and stole sensitive financial information on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694158.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">more than 145 million American adults from the company</a>.</p>
<p>The cost of the Equifax breach to date: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/equifaxs-data-breach-costs-hit-14-billion-a-12473" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$1.4 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, Equifax knew about the vulnerability and had taken steps to patch the flaws across its systems. However, application-security experts have come up with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.databreachtoday.com/blogs/learn-from-how-others-get-breached-equifax-edition-p-2870" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a list of 29 failures</a> that led to the eventual breach. Perhaps the two most important ones: a lack of visibility into what assets and software the company had deployed, said Jim Manico, founder of Manicode Security and volunteer project leader at the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;All that Equifax had to do was apply the patch across their network, but on a couple of servers, either they missed them or they applied the patch and it broke, so they rolled it back&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/manicode" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jim Manico</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being able to determine what assets may be affected by a new vulnerability, and doing it at speed, has become increasingly important, he said. Attackers create exploits from the information they glean from patches much more quickly than they could just a decade ago. In 2006, the average time it took to exploit a known vulnerability was 45 days; in 2015, it was two weeks; and with the Apache Struts 2 flaw, it took three days, Manico said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The responsibility for patching has changed over the last 15 years as attackers have sped up their ability to go from a software patch to an exploit. For anyone running Struts 2, they had 72 hours to patch their systems. This is the No. 1 problem for application security, and developers continue to take it lackadaisically.&#8221;<br />—Jim Manico</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2. Maintain coverage of important classes of vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>The SSRF issue that led to the Capital One breach demonstrates the importance of attaining 100% coverage across both the codebase and deployed applications. While SSRF can be hard to patch in many cases, the class is relatively easy for attackers to find, according to Evan Johnson, manager of the product security team at CloudFlare. He wrote in <a target="_blank" href="https://ejj.io/blog/capital-one" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">an analysis of the Capital One breach</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;SSRF is a bug hunter&#8217;s dream because it is an easy to perform attacks and regularly yields critical findings. &#8230; The problem is common and well-known, but hard to prevent and does not have any mitigations built in to the AWS platform.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ejcx_" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Evan Johnson</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the OWASP Top-10 is a good start for a list of software vulnerability classes that need coverage, every development team has a different list. What is important is for the company to make sure it has good coverage—through tools and processes—of the vulnerability classes on the developers&#8217; list, said Dan Cornell, chief technology officer of Denim Group, an application-security consultancy.</p>
<p>While companies are trying to push more security checks into integrated development environments (IDEs), they should only &#8220;shift left&#8221; those tools that retain a high-level of coverage while not disrupting development, he said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;From a coverage standpoint, you can test for certain vulnerabilities at a certain level of quality, so there are certain types of checking that you can push left. But there are some things that take too much time to integrate into a pipeline—like full static analysis to find SQL injection issues—to move onto the developers&#8217; plates.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/danielcornell" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dan Cornell</a></p>

<h3>3. Teach security continuously</h3>
<p>Development teams usually do not have the incentive to prioritize security in their daily work. Instead, security tends to get in the way of implementing features and do so on deadline.</p>
<p>Security is a tax on developer productivity, but if done correctly, it only has to be an incremental one. Addressing issues early helps minimize the impact on the developer and the impact on the company, which could be very substantial, said Tim Mackey, principal security strategist with vulnerability-management firm Synopsys.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;When I&#8217;ve talked to organizations that had a data breach, they say they have had to spend 50% of the time following a breach, fixing the issues—we are talking about impacts of that magnitude. Developers need the continuous positive reinforcement in their IDE &#8230; where you can make them feel incremental pain and get them information in context so they do the right thing, because they may not know how.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/timintech" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tim Mackey</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Security requirements for developers should also be explicit and actionable, said Nidhi Shah, principal security researcher at Micro Focus. Application-security teams should conduct threat modeling, work with the development team to create the architecture for the product, and then turn those considerations into part of the specification, she says.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The developer should not have to translate architecture requirements into tasks during development. Security should instead be specified as part of the feature template that the developer needs to produce.&#8221;<br />—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nidhi-shah-8046481/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Nidhi Shah</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>4. Strive to make patching painless</h3>
<p>The lowest level of application-security maturity is not patching, which should be unacceptable for any software development team. Companies whose application-security teams track open-source components, triage patches, and include coding feedback in the integrated development environment are above average, at Level 2.</p>
<p>Yet these scanners miss things.</p>
<p>The highest level of maturity for OWASP&#8217;s Manico is not depending on the scanners, but lowering the disruption of patching by automation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Attaining this level of maturity makes your security posture the best, but it also makes your functionality the most fragile, because you are changing every day. If you update every day, you need two things to go fast: one, rigorous security and functionality automation, and two, the willingness to fix dependencies in the open-source world.&#8221;<br />—Jim Manico</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet getting to the point where everything can be patched quickly and relatively painlessly may be out of reach for most development organizations, said Denim Group&#8217;s Cornell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It is easy to give the advice that you need to patch everything, but it is harder to follow at scale, and there are some systems which cannot suffer a disruption. When you patch a server and the Oracle database does not come up and you are losing thousands of dollars a minute, that will make you more hesitant to patch quickly.&#8221;<br />—Dan Cornell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the end, application-security teams need to recruit developers to their cause by making it easy to learn security and integrating security tools that do not get in the way of development.</p>
<p>We need to provide developers help, says Micro Focus&#8217;s Shah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If security is not part of the functional requirement, they are not going to implement it. Deciding whether we can upgrade, whether the vulnerability is applicable to our software—those are questions that often the developer is not able to determine.&#8221;<br />—Nidhi Shah</p>

She has held roles in sales and channel sales and has been a Channel Director for the past four years. In 2019, Natalie developed strong business relationships with the top Cloud Service Providers as they helped their customers on their journey to the cloud as a de facto security provider, facilitated discussions for operational efficiencies so McAfee can transact with the CSPs in both public and gov cloud, and brought in incremental revenue from the channel.</p>
<p>This recognition is special and underscores the work that we’ve done as an organization to hire diverse talent, implement a return to workplace initiative to assist people who have paused their careers, and achieve gender pay parity across the company.</p>
<p>Please join me in congratulating these six outstanding women who are at the core of the McAfee Channel program. Their leadership and execution have been paramount to our success and will continue to help lead us onwards.</p>
