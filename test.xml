<div>
<p>In 2020, DevOps practices crossed the chasm from &#8220;early stage&#8221; and &#8220;experimental&#8221; to mainstream. For DevOps leaders and teams, the focus has been more on how to mature their programs than on figuring out ways to justify and get agile projects off the ground.</p>
<p>More organizations broke into the elite category of DevOps implementers, and there were more examples of best practices and metrics to draw upon for everyone.</p>
<p>Rather than just presenting <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/optimize-devops-tb/5-mistakes-doom-devops?lx=vm26kZ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener">DevOps challenges and fails</a>, <em>TechBeacon</em>&#8216;s best DevOps stories for 2020 examine the success that organizations have had with DevOps, the lessons that others can learn from them, the leadership and culture needed to succeed, <a target="_blank" href="https://content.microfocus.com/optimize-devops-tb/devops-success-metrics?lx=vm26kZ&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172440" rel="noopener">how to measure success</a>, and steps organizations can take to get agile right.</p>
<h3>Best practices</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/10-companies-killing-it-devops-2020" rel="noopener">10 companies killing it at DevOps in 2020</a></h4>
<p>Many of the leading implementers of DevOps practices five years ago—including Netflix, Walmart, and Amazon—have gone on to become household names both within the tech community and in the consumer arena. In this report, freelance writer <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/christophernull" rel="nofollow noopener">Christopher Null</a> rounds up a list of 10 companies that are pushing the limits of DevOps practices and have emerged as clear leaders in the implementation of DevOps.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/6-proven-metrics-devops-success" rel="noopener">6 proven metrics for DevOps success</a> </h4>
<p><span><span>Many teams have a hard time demonstrating the value of DevOps practices to management because of a failure to use the right metrics. Figuring out the right measurements and knowing how to use them can have a big influence on DevOps transformation efforts. Here, </span></span><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/DukeAMO" rel="nofollow noopener"><span><span>Ann Marie Fred</span></span></a><span><span>, DevOps and security lead at IBM, and </span></span><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/CraigCookIT" rel="nofollow noopener"><span><span>Craig Cook</span></span></a><span><span>, DevOps coach at IBM, identify six metrics that have worked for their team.</span></span></p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-agile-teams-can-get-devops-right-6-essential-steps" rel="noopener">How agile teams can get DevOps right: 6 essential steps</a></h4>
<p><span><span>Agile teams can often get off to a great start but then stumble along the way. The positive user feedback and progress that was evident in biweekly increments begin to fade, and suddenly defect lists start growing, testing takes longer, and velocity becomes erratic. </span></span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natespillson/" rel="nofollow noopener"><span><span>Nate Berent-Spillson</span></span></a><span><span>, technology principal at software development consultancy Nexient, explains the six steps that agile teams can take to get DevOps right. His recommendations include killing off manual practices, identifying code bottlenecks, and implementing test automation.</span></span></p>
<h3>Leadership/culture</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/devops-must-reads-7-titles-every-practitioner-should-read" rel="noopener">DevOps must-reads: 7 titles every practitioner should read</a></h4>
<p>Upskilling has become a key requirement for career development in the IT industry. This is especially true in the talent-strapped DevOps space, where enterprises are actively investing in skills transformation programs for their current staff. Here, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/JayneGroll" rel="nofollow noopener">Jayne Groll</a>, CEO of the DevOps Institute, lists seven must-read books for everyone interested in advancing their DevOps careers. The newly published books help readers deepen their understanding of DevOps challenges and cover a variety of topics, including software delivery, digital transformation, and digital disruption.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/devops-100-do-your-ops-boss-follow-these-top-pros" rel="noopener">DevOps 100: Do ops like a boss. Follow these top pros</a></h4>
<p>The best way to keep up with new DevOps developments is to pay attention to what the leaders in the space are doing, says freelance writer <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jpmello" rel="nofollow noopener">John P. Mello, Jr.</a> in this lineup of the industry&#8217;s 100 top DevOps leaders. Mello&#8217;s list was assembled using feedback from the <a target="_blank" href="https://events.itrevolution.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">DevOps Enterprise Summit</a> programming committee at IT Revolution. The list is organized into multiple categories, including noted authors, developer relations, next-generation operations, and open source.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/are-poor-team-interactions-killing-your-devops-transformation" rel="noopener">Are poor team interactions killing your DevOps transformation?</a></h4>
<p>The pandemic-triggered shift to a largely distributed workforce has exposed weaknesses in the way many organizations have defined teams and areas of focus for their DevOps efforts. For some, the lack of well-defined ways for team interaction in a remote-first world is threatening digital transformation efforts. Here <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/matthewpskelton" rel="nofollow noopener">Matthew Skelton</a>, founder and head of consulting at training firm Conflux, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuelpais/" rel="nofollow noopener">Manuel Pais</a>, an independent IT organizational consultant, explain the risks organizations face when they fail to explicitly design communication among DevOps teams that are scattered across physical and online spaces.</p>
<h3>Secure DevOps</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/why-injecting-security-devops-no-brainer" rel="noopener">Why injecting security into DevOps is a no-brainer</a></h4>
<p>Despite heightened awareness of security issues, many DevOps teams are reluctant to integrate security into their processes because they perceive it as a roadblock to agile software development and delivery. In addition to concerns about security slowing down development, many software managers also continue to be unaware of how to integrate security into DevOps processes. In this cautionary report, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/itsridhar" rel="nofollow noopener">Sridhar Jayaraman</a>, vice president of engineering at digital transformation services provider Qentelli, highlights the dangers of not implementing a DevSecOps program.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/get-security-compliance-devsecops-4-key-components" rel="noopener">Get security and compliance with DevSecOps: 4 key components</a></h4>
<p>Security is only one aspect of DevSecOps. Compliance is the other. A good DevSecOps program embeds compliance policies, best practices, and tools into every phase of the development lifecycle. It will not only allow for better productivity, quality, and security, but also help all aspects of a compliance framework, says <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewdavis-io/" rel="nofollow noopener">Andrew Davis</a>, evangelist at Copado, which sells a value-stream platform for Salesforce. In this report, he outlines the four components that are key to building both security and compliance into a DevSecOps program.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/3-best-practices-devsecops-elite" rel="noopener">3 best practices of the DevSecOps elite</a></h4>
<p>Employee engagement and satisfaction can have a big impact on software security. The 2020 DevOps Community Survey found that happy developers tend to be more engaged with their work and tend to be more readily found in organizations with mature DevSecOps practices than in organizations with weak and immature practices. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/djschleen" rel="nofollow noopener">DJ Schleen</a>, Senior Manager, Software Security at Rally Health, identifies three best practices of DevSecOps elites and explains why each trait matters.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/devops-fatigue-next-dont-buy-dogma" rel="noopener">Is DevOps fatigue next? Don&#8217;t buy into the dogma</a></h4>
<p>Implementing DevOps can be challenging. The many dead ends and wrong turns that DevOps teams often encounter along the way can be frustrating. To facilitate the transition from an established development practice—such as waterfall—to a more agile environment, DevOps leaders need to be patient, supportive, and understanding. Here, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-head-b2241b3/" rel="nofollow noopener">James Head</a>, CEO and founder at Rebellion Consulting, offers helpful guidance on what organizations should do to avoid DevOps fatigue.</p>
<h3>Trends</h3>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/4-devops-anti-patterns-lead-disaster" rel="noopener">4 DevOps anti-patterns that lead to disaster</a></h4>
<p>Demanding consistency in agile transformation efforts at all times can be counter-productive, says <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-stiehm/" rel="nofollow noopener">Thomas Stiehm</a>, chief technology officer at Coveros, which provides agile and transformation products and services. The request for ever-present consistency might help address short-term issues but can lead to long-term pain and failure. In this article, Stiehm explains what anti-patterns are and why they are so sneaky and counter-productive. He lists four anti-patterns that are particularly problematic and offers tips on how DevOps leaders can fix each of them.</p>
<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://techbeacon.com/devops/top-5-devops-trends-what-being-mainstream-means-your-team" rel="noopener">The top 5 DevOps trends: What being mainstream means to your team</a></h4>
<p>Data from the 2019 Accelerate State of DevOps Report suggests that DevOps practices have gone mainstream. No longer attempting to justify and implement, DevOps leaders have begun focusing more on issues such as how to get more efficiencies out of once-experimental projects, how to bake in resilience, and how to make software delivery pipelines more compliant and safer. Freelance writer <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/erickachick" rel="nofollow noopener">Ericka Chickowski</a> identifies the top five trends now that DevOps has gone mainstream.</p>

<div>
<p>As you start writing more and more automated tests with <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/11/11/selenium-webdriver-from-a-to-z/" rel="noopener">Selenium WebDriver</a>, you will start encountering various exceptions. I’ll guide you through the most common Selenium exceptions and help you solve them so your C# automation framework is more reliable.</p>

</ol>
<hr/>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="what-are-exceptions" rel="noopener">What are exceptions?</strong></h2>
<p>Exceptions are errors that occur during application execution. Exception objects are created and then they are thrown with the <strong>throw</strong> keyword. When unhandled, they disrupt the normal program execution.</p>
<h2><strong><a target="_blank" id="selenium-exceptions" rel="noopener">Common Selenium exceptions</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s go through the most common Selenium exceptions that you might encounter, understand their causes, and see the possible solutions.</p>
<h3><strong>1. NoSuchElementException</strong></h3>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/T_OpenQA_Selenium_NoSuchElementException.htm" rel="noopener">NoSuchElementException</a> is thrown when the element cannot be found on the web page. This can happen for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are using the wrong locator. There is no “one fits all” <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/11/13/optimized-selenium-selector-strategies-from-a-z/" rel="noopener">locator strategy</a>, but you have to make sure that you are using a locator that is both unique, and correct. Pay extra attention if you are using CSS selectors or <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2019/11/18/xpath-and-ui-element-identification-using-xpath-selectors/" rel="noopener">XPaths</a>, and make sure they are correct.</li>
<li>The web page was not completely loaded and the element is not found. To solve it, you can use Selenium explicit waits, and wait until the element can be found on the page. Here’s a code example in C# (you’ll also need to install the DotNetSeleniumExtras NuGet package):</li>
</ul>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="csharp">WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));
IWebElement LoginButton = wait.Until(SeleniumExtras.WaitHelpers.ExpectedConditions.ElementExists(By.Id("login")));</pre>
<ul>
<li>The element is not visible on the page and you have to scroll up or down to reach it. You can do this using a JavaScript executor:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">public void scrollDown()
{
      IJavaScriptExecutor js = (IJavaScriptExecutor)driver;
      js.ExecuteScript("window.scrollBy(0,250)", "");
}</pre>
<h3><strong>2. ElementNotVisibleException</strong></h3>
<p>This one is a bit different than the NoSuchElementException, because it means that the element was found in the DOM, but it is not visible on the page. This also means that we cannot interact with the element, so we can’t click, send keys, or perform other actions on it. It can happen if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The element is hidden.</li>
<li>The locator strategy you are using finds more elements with the same locator, and the first one is not visible.</li>
</ul>
<p>To fix this, first make sure that you are using a unique locator, and that you are identifying the correct element on the page.</p>
<p>If your locator is good, then you can add a wait, that checks when the element is visible:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="csharp">WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)); 
IWebElement LoginButton = wait.Until(SeleniumExtras.WaitHelpers.ExpectedConditions.ElementIsVisible(By.Id("login")));</pre>
<h3><strong>3. InvalidSelectorException</strong></h3>
<p>This Selenium exception is thrown if you are using an incorrect selector. An example of this would be using a compound class name, which is not allowed:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="csharp">private IWebElement LoginButton =&gt; driver.FindElement(By.ClassName("login button"));</pre>
<p>The solution for this is to make sure that the locator is correct. In the above scenario, you can replace the ClassName locator strategy with CssSelector:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="csharp">private IWebElement LoginButton =&gt; driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector("login.button"));</pre>
<h3><strong>4. ElementClickInterceptedException</strong></h3>
<p>This Selenium exception is usually thrown when the element was found on the page, but the click action would be performed on a different element that is overlapped our element. For example, if you go to the TestProject <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/" rel="noopener">blog</a> page and scroll down a bit, you will see a message prompting you to Sign Up for the <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/" rel="noopener">TestProject</a> test automation platform. You won’t be able to click any of the links on the page until you close it.</p>
<p></p>
<p><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16142 size-medium" title="Selenium Exception ElementClickInterceptedException" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ElementClickInterceptedException-512x340.png" alt="Selenium Exception ElementClickInterceptedException" width="512" height="340" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ElementClickInterceptedException-512x340.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ElementClickInterceptedException-768x510.png 768w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ElementClickInterceptedException-1024x680.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"/></noscript></p>
<p>So, if you have something like this in a <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/category/selenium/" rel="noopener">Selenium</a> test, and your test tries to click a blog title, you will get an ElementClickInterceptedException.</p>
<p>One solution to this exception is to use the Action class for performing the click:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">Actions _action = new Actions(driver);
_action.MoveToElement(elementToClick).Click();</pre>
<p>Or if the element is simply out of view and scrolling will reveal it, you can use the JavaScript scroll executor as shown above for the NoSuchElementException.</p>
<h3><strong>5. StaleElementReferenceException</strong></h3>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/exceptions/#stale_element_reference" rel="noopener">StaleElementReferenceException</a> means that a reference to an element is now “stale”, i.e. the element is no longer available on the web page DOM. In other words, the element was initially found on the DOM, but the DOM has changed since then. The common causes for this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The element was deleted from the DOM.</li>
<li>The element is no longer attached to the DOM.</li>
</ul>
<p>One possible solution is to refresh the page and try to find the element again:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">driver.Navigate().Refresh();
driver.FindElement(By.Id("ElementId")).Click();</pre>
<p>Or you can wait for the element to load before you manipulate it. Again, you can do this using explicit <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/04/13/selenium-wait-methods/" rel="noopener">waits</a>:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)); 
IWebElement elementToInteract = wait.Until(SeleniumExtras.WaitHelpers.ExpectedConditions.ElementToBeClickable(By.Id("elementId")));</pre>
<h3><strong>6. UnhandledAlertException</strong></h3>
<p>This exception is thrown when an alert is present on the page, preventing you from interacting with the elements. You can dismiss or accept the alert, as needed, and move on with the test steps:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="csharp">// Dismiss the alert
driver.SwitchTo().Alert().Dismiss();
// Accept the alert
driver.SwitchTo().Alert().Accept();</pre>
<h3><strong>7. NoAlertPresentException</strong></h3>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/T_OpenQA_Selenium_NoAlertPresentException.htm" rel="noopener">NoAlertPresentException</a> is thrown when Selenium is trying to interact with an alert that is not loaded on the webpage. If the alert is indeed not loaded at all, then you may have found a bug in your AUT, or perhaps you are missing the steps that lead to the alert opening. Another reason can be that the alert is displayed slower than Selenium performs the actions. In this case, you can add an implicit wait to your code, so the action performed on the alert is delayed by a few seconds:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="csharp">driver.Manage().Timeouts().ImplicitWait = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5);</pre>
<p>However, be mindful when using implicit waits, as the timespan you select will apply even if the element or alert you are waiting for has already been loaded on the page.</p>
<h3><strong>8. NoSuchFrameException</strong></h3>
<p>Similar to the NoSuchElementException, this Selenium exception is thrown when a frame is not found. Again, this can happen for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are using an incorrect frame Id or name. In this case, make sure that you correctly identify the frame you want to switch to.</li>
<li>The frame was not yet loaded. To solve this, you can use the solution above and add an implicit wait.</li>
<li>The frame is nested inside a different frame. In this case, you must first switch to the parent frame, then to the frame you want to use.</li>
</ul>

<p><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-16157 " title="Nested Frames in HTML" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NestedFrames.png" alt="Nested Frames in HTML" width="952" height="468" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NestedFrames.png 1476w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NestedFrames-512x252.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NestedFrames-768x378.png 768w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NestedFrames-1024x504.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px"/></noscript></p>
<p>In this example, to interact with elements inside “frame-left”, you would first need to switch to “frame-top”:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="csharp">driver.SwitchTo().Frame("frame-top");
driver.SwitchTo().Frame("frame-left");</pre>
<h3><strong>9. NoSuchWindowException</strong></h3>
<p>This one is very similar to the previous exception, applied to windows. This happens when you try to switch to a new window (or tab), which cannot be found. You can solve this by getting all the windows handles, then switching to the correct one:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="csharp">var windows = driver.WindowHandles;
driver.SwitchTo().Window(windows[1]);</pre>
<h3><strong>10. TimeoutException</strong></h3>
<p>This exception will be thrown when the page or element was not loaded after the specified wait time. To overcome this, you can increase the wait time, if you are using an implicit wait, or better yet, replace the implicit wait with an explicit wait.</p>
<h2><a target="_blank" id="handling-exceptions" rel="noopener"><strong>Handling exceptions with try-catch</strong></h2>
<p>Sometimes, the expected result is to actually have an exception thrown. In this case, you don’t want your code to stop executing or to throw the exception. Instead, you want to catch the exception and perform a certain action when the exception is thrown.</p>
<p>That means you need to <strong>handle </strong>the exception. This can be done with a try-catch block. Let’s assume you have a method that searches for the Logout button. You will use it in the test assertions, and you expect the button to be found when the login is successful, and not found when the login fails. In this case, the method will return a boolean, and if the element is not found it will throw a NoSuchElementException. Instead of the exception, you want the method to return false. This can be achieved by using the following code:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="null">public bool IsElementFound()
{
        try
        {
                driver.FindElement(By.Id("LogoutButton"));
                return true;
        }
        catch (NoSuchElementException e)
        {
                return false;
        }
}</pre>
<p>Another scenario can be that even though you don’t expect the error, you still want your program to continue running, and have the failure result logged and displayed gracefully in your <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/10/25/built-in-html-reports-for-selenium-c-tests/" rel="noopener">test report</a>. In this case, you can use the catch block to log the error and display a more user-friendly message, such as “The test failed because the Logout button was not found”. Looks a lot more better than “ClassName=OpenQA.Selenium.NoSuchElementException, Message=no such element: Unable to locate element”. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2><a target="_blank" id="conclusion" rel="noopener"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The more tests you write, the higher the chances that you’ll encounter at least some of these Selenium exceptions during your work. Hopefully, this article can help you understand them and deal with them <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Looking Ahead to 2021: The Things We’ll Carry Forward Right now, I’m thinking about how my life changed in 2020.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <br />

<div>
<div class="author-block padding-bottom-xs">
                
            </div>
<h2><strong>Looking Ahead to 2021: The Things We’ll Carry Forward </strong></h2>
<p>Right now, I’m thinking about how my life changed in 2020. Not so much in the sweeping and upending ways. More in the little ways. I’m thinking about the coping ways. The cobble-it-all-together ways. The little changes to make things work ways. There were plenty.  Now, with the first doses of vaccine going to those who need it most, I find myself wondering which of those little changes from 2020 will carry over into post-pandemic days.</p>
<p>One thing I do know, central to many of those changes was the internet.</p>
<h2><strong>The little things meant a lot</strong></h2>
<p>For starters, I now have a chocolatier in my home. That’s courtesy of the online Master Classes my husband  and I took—his course of study being chocolate making. (We’ll see how he tops that in 2021. Chocolate sets a pretty high bar.) Would we have taken our respective classes otherwise? Hard to say. But I will say this—it was a comfort.</p>
<p>I know that ordering my mother’s groceries online so she could avoid going into the store and stay safe was new. And through working online, I feel like I got invited into my team members’ homes where I had the pleasure of meeting  their spouses, children and pets. Also, while I could not travel like I wanted to, I could still <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/date-night-fromhome-ideas-2/?hilite=%27virtual%27%2C%27tours%27" rel="noopener">go exploring with virtual tours</a> of the world’s great museums plus catch a few <a target="_blank" href="https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/vr/" rel="noopener">great dive sites without getting wet</a>. Those were all unique to 2020 as well.</p>
<p>I count myself fortunate that I had those options available to me, as many people simply did not—whether because a lack of connectivity held them back, or their working situations simply could not make the jump to online. With that, I think of the essential workers, the first responders, the medical professionals of all walks, and the people who kept our communities going by being on the front lines of this pandemic. We all owe them so much, both now and moving forward.</p>
<h2><strong>The internet helped us live our lives in 2020</strong></h2>
<p>Yet where possible, the internet responded, in the best way that it could. For those of us who saw our work, studies, and livelihoods shift online, the internet proved that it could step in. It’s been far from ideal, of course. The internet is simply no substitute for us working and being together, yet it helped so many of us face the challenges of 2020. Even if we didn’t use the internet for work or school, it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/how-to-ace-your-video-interview-job-hunting-from-home/?hilite=%27job%27%2C%27hunt%27" rel="noopener">helped us find employment</a>, get care by way of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/medical-care-fromhome-telemedicine-and-seniors/?hilite=%27telemedicine%27" rel="noopener">telemedicine</a>, and keep in touch thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/zooming-with-the-grandkids-five-easy-video-chat-apps-for-the-holidays/" rel="noopener">free video conferencing</a>, just to name a few things.</p>
<p>Put plainly, the internet helped us live our lives this year. And out of necessity, it re-shaped the way we live our lives too. So, without question, I can see some of little changes I made carrying over. My husband and I will take more Master Classes. I like the idea of helping my mom with the shopping when I can’t be with her. And I’ll keep exploring, even while that means restricting it to online for now. I’m sure you can count think of a few examples of your own too—things that made your life a little better this year and that can make the years to come better too.</p>
<h2><strong>Some of the big changes ahead in 2021</strong></h2>
<p>Looking beyond my own homestead, I’m hoping that 2021 will prompt broader, and immensely positive, changes as part of lessons learned from 2020.</p>
<p>With regards to internet access, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/consumer-threat-notices/thankful-for-broadband-internet-and-hopeful-for-much-more/" rel="noopener">this year has underscored the internet’s role as an essential utility</a>. It’s no longer a luxury. I predict we’ll see renewed energy in public and private partnerships that will connect more people to fixed broadband internet connections so that they can benefit from the same professional, educational, and personal opportunities that the rest of us on broadband already enjoy.</p>
<p>During the election year here in the U.S., there’s been plenty of conversation about the propagation of disinformation and misinformation on the internet, both by bad actors and by the unwitting parties who fall prey to their falsehoods. We covered the topic extensively in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?s=election" rel="noopener">our election blogs</a>, and I believe the ability to critically assess what we see and read on the internet is a major issue of our time, whether it’s an election year or not. Disinformation and misinformation online are here to stay, and there’s an opportunity for schools to introduce instruction on smart media consumption as part of their curriculums.</p>
<p>And, what about working from home? Will it become a new norm for business in some shape or other? Working from home remains a complicated conversation, as a mix of public health concerns, local mandates, and stark financial realities drove that shift to remote workforces in the first place. Now, similar questions arise as communities and economies recover. Companies will make strategic decisions about their properties, people, and how they all work together—not to mention how they ensure personal and corporate security in a remote workplace setting. If we use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2416265/rei-selling-bellevue-headquarters-remote-work" rel="noopener">major outdoor retailer REI as one example</a>, we’ll see that the answers are nuanced—particularly when the end result means selling a newly built and never-used corporate headquarters like REI did.</p>
<h2><strong>A stronger and greater 2021</strong></h2>
<p>To bring it all back home, let’s see what’s worth carrying forward into 2021. We learned a multitude of hard lessons in 2020, and we pulled off plenty of clever moves in response. As much as we’d like to put 2020 behind us, let’s take a moment to pause and consider where some of the silver linings were and see if we can spin them into something stronger and greater in 2021.</p>
<p>And on a personal note I would like to end 2020 and start 2021 expressing my gratitude for the frontline workers, teachers and humanitarians who place service to society above all else. We have heroes in our midst and that is something to celebrate!</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>

<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far {</span><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/09/29/the-rise-of-shadow-dom-core-technical-aspects/" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1st Part of Shadow DOM series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  &amp;  </span><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/10/13/shadow-dom-elements-and-using-the-testproject-opensdk-part-2/" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2nd Part of Shadow DOM series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">}, we are much familiar with Shadow DOM aspects as well as TestProject’s SDK flawless support for it. Now it’s high time to understand – </span><span style="color: #000080;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How TestProject’s AI-powered Record/Playback feature leverages graceful handling of Shadow DOM elements?</span></i></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So without wasting a single moment, we should jump on TestProject’s <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/12/23/self-healing-to-the-rescue-of-flaky-test-automation/" rel="noopener">AI-powered Self-Healing Test Recorder</a>. I hope you would <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f497.png" alt="💗" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> it!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><b>Does TestProject’s record/playback feature directly record the Shadow DOM elements?</b></span></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/easy-test-automation/" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Record and playback</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> features are a really useful tool for automated testing – especially for naive test engineers. The way they work is that the test engineers just click a record button, do some actions on AUT, and then click stop. When replaying the recording, the same actions should be performed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you do recording on TestProject, automation scripts are automatically generated and saved on the platform under your account. Later we can run the same scripts by playback feature. We can also make changes to the script to make the test run differently e.g. change selectors or test data. This allows the test engineer to update, maintain, and make improvements to the recorded scripts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By default, TestProject’s record/playback feature records the web elements by using all legacy selectors {CSS, XPath, etc.}, moreover, it considers the Shadow DOM elements as plain DOM elements. In our application, we will record the Shadow DOM elements by taking two actions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter some text inside the element</span><span style="color: #000080;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‘enter-text-area’</span></i></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Click<span style="color: #000080;"><i> ‘btn-enter’</i></span> element</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000080;">Let’s record and save the script on your TestProject account &gt;<br /></span><br /><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-16500 size-large" title="Create New TestProject Test" alt="Create New TestProject Test" width="640" height="512" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/record-1-1024x819.png 1024w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/record-1-512x410.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/record-1-768x614.png 768w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/record-1-1024x819.png"/><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-16500 size-large" title="Create New TestProject Test" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/record-1-1024x819.png" alt="Create New TestProject Test" width="640" height="512" srcset="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/record-1-1024x819.png 1024w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/record-1-512x410.png 512w, https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/record-1-768x614.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"/></noscript></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000080;">Let’s observe the recorded elements and rectify the problem &gt;<br /></span>Navigate to your account and open the respectively recorded script. Here we can clearly observe, it has no capability to record Shadow DOM elements inside the shadow-root i.e.<span style="color: #000080;"><i> ‘enter-text-area’ </i></span>and<span style="color: #000080;"><i> ‘btn-enter’</i></span><span style="color: #000080;">.</span> Despite recording the Shadow DOM elements, it has recorded the general element<span style="color: #000080;"><i> “ID=todo-app’’</i></span> i.e. just outside the entry point of the shadow-root. Moreover, we can clearly see, it has used CSSSelector for the recording, which does not support Shadow DOM elements.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-16478 size-full" title="TestProject AI-powered Test Recorder" alt="TestProject AI-powered Test Recorder" width="825" height="500" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old.gif"/><noscript><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-16478 size-full" title="TestProject AI-powered Test Recorder" src="https://blog.testproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old.gif" alt="TestProject AI-powered Test Recorder" width="825" height="500"/></noscript><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000080;">Let’s run the recorded scripts – if it FAILS or not? &gt;<br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it would fail because – it will try to take action on the Shadow DOM elements that are actually recorded in the wrong way. We can clearly see the failed <a target="_blank" href="https://testproject.io/executive-test-reports/" rel="noopener">test report</a> on our TestProject’s account:</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000080;"><b>What tweaks are required in the recorded TestProject’s script, so that it can identify the Shadow DOM elements?</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we are good at our technology then we can tweak our stuff very easily – whenever automated recording fails then manual intervention comes into the picture. Let’s edit those recorded elements:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Change TYPE from</span><span style="color: #000080;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‘Element Action’</span></i></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to</span><span style="color: #000080;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‘Action</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select ACTION as </span><span style="color: #000080;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Execute JavaScript’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add CODE for</span><span style="color: #000080;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‘enter-text-area’</span></i></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> element i.e. your JS code to find Shadow DOM element</span></li>
</ul>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="js">return document.querySelector('#todo-app').shadowRoot.querySelector('#adds-item')
.shadowRoot.querySelector('#enter-text-area').value="Demo Test"</pre>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add CODE for</span><span style="color: #000080;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‘btn-enter’</span></i></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> element i.e. your JS code to find Shadow DOM element</span></li>
</ul>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="js">return document.querySelector('#todo-app').shadowRoot.querySelector('#adds-item')
.shadowRoot.querySelector('.btn-enter').click()</pre>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Save all changes for both elements</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000080;">Let’s run the updated scripts – if it PASSES or not? &gt;<br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it would pass because – this time it will interact and take actions on the Shadow DOM elements. We can clearly see the passes test report on our TestProject’s account:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000080;">As a workaround &gt;<br /></span><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f4cd.png" alt="📍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span><span style="color: #000000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have seen that TestProject’s record/playback feature leverages options to edit the recorded script and moreover giving the option to add our own JavaScript. With the help of JS, we can interact easily with Shadow DOM elements. The best part of TestProject’s record/playback feature is its in-built handling of typecasting the WebDriver with JavascriptExecutor interface.</span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After my webinar on <a target="_blank" href="https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2020/proposal/13709/rise-of-shadow-dom-lets-solve-it-through-webdriver" rel="noopener">Selenium International Virtual conference 2020</a> – I came across one exciting query from many of the test engineers so let’s discuss it right here:</span></p>
<p><b/><span style="color: #000080;"><b>How to interact with Shadow DOM elements, if they reside inside the iFrame?</b></span><b><br /></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truthfully, there is no change in the handling of Shadow DOM elements if they reside inside the iFrame or not. But before taking any action on iFrame’s Shadow DOM elements, we have to do context switching to iFrame and after taking our actions we can switch back our context to the main window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f4cd.png" alt="📍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />An application</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we have used above for the automation, can be found at – </span></i><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/VirenderPannu/polymer3-letsplanapp" rel="noopener"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">GitHub repo</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This application is implemented by using Google’s Polymer library with NodeJS. So install those first before recording this application locally. </span></i></p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Key Takeaways</span></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clear thought – What tweaks are required in the recorded TestProject’s script, so that it can identify the Shadow DOM elements?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Familiar with TestProject’s in-built typecasting of WebDriver with JavascriptExecutor</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understood – How to interact with Shadow DOM elements, if they reside inside the iFrame?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now we are completely handy with Shadow DOM trees with their elements and their graceful handling with TestProject’s Open SDK as well as Record/Playback feature. Happy testing guys and try to play with Shadow DOM and its elements.</span></p>
